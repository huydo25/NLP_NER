19247688	Deposition of a recombinant peptide in ER-derived protein bodies by retention with cysteine-rich prolamins in transgenic rice seed.	2009	Planta	A 7Crp peptide composed of seven major human T cell epitopes derived from the Japanese cedar pollen allergens Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 is an ideal tolerogen for peptide immunotherapy against Japanese cedar pollinosis. To maximize the accumulation level of the 7Crp peptide in transgenic rice seed, we tested endosperm specific promoters and intracellular localizations suitable for stable accumulation. A 7Crp peptide carrying the KDEL ER retention signal directed by the 2.3-kb promoter of the glutelin GluB-1, which contains a signal peptide, accumulated at the highest level of about 60 microg/grain. Notably, the 7Crp peptide predominantly accumulated in ER-derived protein bodies irrespective of the presence of various sorting signals or expression as a fusion protein with glutelin. We attribute this abnormal pattern of accumulation to the formation of disulfide bonds between the 7Crp peptide and cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) prolamin storage proteins. Furthermore, the formation of these aggregates induced the chaperone proteins BiP and PDI as an ER stress response.
19246394	Variations in Hd1 proteins, Hd3a promoters, and Ehd1 expression levels contribute to diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice is a facultative short-day plant, and molecular genetic studies have identified the major genes involved in short-day flowering. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting the diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice are not known. We used a core collection of 64 rice cultivars that represent the genetic diversity of 332 accessions from around the world and studied the expression levels and polymorphisms of 6 genes in the short-day flowering pathway. The RNA levels of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), encoding a floral activator, are highly correlated with flowering time, and there is a high degree of polymorphism in the Heading date 1 (Hd1) protein, which is a major regulator of Hd3a expression. Functional and nonfunctional alleles of Hd1 are associated with early and late flowering, respectively, suggesting that Hd1 is a major determinant of variation in flowering time of cultivated rice. We also found that the type of Hd3a promoter and the level of Ehd1 expression contribute to the diversity in flowering time and Hd3a expression level. We evaluated the contributions of these 3 factors by a statistical analysis using a simple linear model, and the results supported our experimental observations.
19242671	Detection of a quantitative trait locus controlling carbon isotope discrimination and its contribution to stomatal conductance in japonica rice.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Increasing leaf photosynthesis offers a possible way to improve yield potential in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) has potential as an indirect selection criterion. In this study, we searched for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling Delta(13)C, and assessed their association with leaf photosynthesis. Substitution mapping by using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), that carry segments from the indica cultivar Kasalath in the genetic background of the japonica cultivar Koshihikari, identified genomic regions affecting Delta(13)C on chromosomes (Chr.) 2, 3, 6, 7, and 12. One of the CSSLs, SL208, in which most regions on Chr. 3 were substituted with Kasalath segments, showed higher leaf stomatal conductance for CO(2) (g (s)) and Delta(13)C than Koshihikari during the vegetative stage although leaf photosynthetic rate did not differ between them. These results suggest an association between Delta(13)C and g (s). To test this association, we performed a QTL analysis for Delta(13)C at vegetative and heading stages in an F(2) population derived from a cross between SL208 and Koshihikari. The results confirmed a QTL controlling Delta(13)C on the long arm of Chr. 3. By using a near-isogenic line specific to Hd6, we ruled out the possibility that variation in Delta(13)C was generated through the pleiotropic effect of heading date.
19234674	Spermine facilitates recovery from drought but does not confer drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants expressing Datura stramonium S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Polyamines are known to play important roles in plant stress tolerance but it has been difficult to determine precise functions for each type of polyamine and their interrelationships. To dissect the roles of putrescine from the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, we generated transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing a heterologous S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene from Datura stramonium so that spermidine and spermine levels could be investigated while maintaining a constant putrescine pool. Whereas transgenic plants expressing arginine decarboxylase (ADC) produced higher levels of putrescine, spermidine and spermine, and were protected from drought stress, transgenic plants expressing SAMDC produced normal levels of putrescine and showed drought symptoms typical of wild type plants under stress, but the transgenic plants showed a much more robust recovery on return to normal conditions (90% full recovery compared to 25% partial recovery for wild type plants). At the molecular level, both wild type and transgenic plants showed transient reductions in the levels of endogenous ADC1 and SAMDC mRNA, but only wild type plants showed a spike in putrescine levels under stress. In transgenic plants, there was no spike in putrescine but a smooth increase in spermine levels at the expense of spermidine. These results confirm and extend the threshold model for polyamine activity in drought stress, and attribute individual roles to putrescine, spermidine and spermine.
19234555	Delimitation of the PSH1(t) gene for rice purple leaf sheath to a 23.5 kb DNA fragment.	2009	Genome	Leaf sheath color plays an important role as a marker for rice genetic improvement. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 220 individuals was developed from a cross between an Oryza sativa subsp. indica variety, IRBB60, and an Oryza sativa subsp. japonica variety, 9407. Within the RIL population, a line, RI51, was found to have purple leaf sheath (PSH). To map the gene governing PSH, RI51 was crossed with 9407 green leaf sheath (GSH) to develop an F2 segregating population. The distribution of F2 plants with PSH and GSH fitted a segregation ratio of 3:1, indicating that the PSH was controlled by a major dominant gene. The gene locus for PSH, tentatively designated as PSH1(t), was identified by surveying two bulks made of the respective 40 individuals with PSH and GSH with SSR markers covering the entire rice genome. The survey indicated that the PSH1(t) region was located on chromosome 1. Further confirmation was made using a large random sample of 360 individuals from the same F2 population and the PSH1(t) locus was then mapped on chromosome 1 between SSR markers RM3475 and RM7202 with genetic distances of 2.0 and 1.1 cM, respectively. For fine mapping of PSH1(t), a large F(2:3) segregating population with 3300 individuals from the seven heterozygous F2 plants in the RM3475-RM7202 region was constructed. Analysis of recombinants in the PSH1(t) region anchored the gene locus to an interval of 23.5 kb flanked by the left marker L03 and the right marker L05. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted six open reading frames encoding a putative trans-sialidase, a putative Plastidic ATP/ADP-transporter, and four unknown proteins. The detailed genetic and physical maps of the PSH1(t) locus will be very useful in molecular cloning of the PSH1(t) gene.
19233441	Purification and cDNA cloning of a wound inducible glucosyltransferase active toward 12-hydroxy jasmonic acid.	2009	Phytochemistry	Tuberonic acid (12-hydroxy epi-jasmonic acid, TA) and its glucoside (TAG) were isolated from potato leaflets (Solanumtuberosum L.) and shown to have tuber-inducing properties. The metabolism of jasmonic acid (JA) to TAG in plant leaflets, and translocation of the resulting TAG to the distal parts, was demonstrated in a previous study. It is thought that TAG generated from JA transmits a signal from the damaged parts to the undamaged parts by this mechanism. In this report, the metabolism of TA in higher plants was demonstrated using [12-(3)H]TA, and a glucosyltransferase active toward TA was purified from the rice cell cultures. The purified protein was shown to be a putative salicylic acid (SA) glucosyltransferase (OsSGT) by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Recombinant OsSGT obtained by overexpression in Escherichia coli was active not only toward TA but also toward SA. The OsSGT characterized in this research was not specific, but this is the first report of a glucosyltransferase active toward TA. mRNA expressional analysis of OsSGT and quantification of TA, TAG, SA and SAG after mechanical wounding indicated that OsSGT is involved in the wounding response. These results demonstrated a crucial role for TAG not only in potato tuber formation, but also in the stress response in plants and that the SA glucosyltransferase can work for TA glucosylation.
19232772	Jasmonic acid, protein phosphatase inhibitor, metals and UV-irradiation increased momilactone A and B concentrations in the moss Hypnum plumaeforme.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Momilactone A and B have been found only in rice and the moss, Hypnum plumaeforme, although both plants are taxonomically quite distinct. The endogenous concentrations of momilactone A and B in H. plumaeforme were 58.7 and 24.3 microg/g dry weight, respectively. UV-irradiation increased the concentrations of momilactone A and B. The concentrations of momilactone A and B, respectively, became 14- and 15-fold greater than those of non-UV-irradiated control. CuCl2 and FeCl2 (1 mmol/L) treatments also increased momilactone A and B concentrations by 2.7- to 6.1-fold and 2.9- to 6.3-fold, respectively. In addition, the protein phosphatase inhibitor, cantharidin, and jasmonic acid increased momilactone A and B concentrations in H. plumaeforme. Cantharidin acts as an elicitor and jasmonic acid is an important signaling molecule regulating inducible defense genes against the pathogen infection. Momilactone A and B, respectively, were increased 12- and 11-fold by 200 micromol/L cantharidin, and 14- and 15-fold by 100 micromol/L jasmonic acid compared with non-treated controls. As momilactone A and B are phytoalexins, these compounds may play an important role in defense responses against biotic and abiotic stress conditions in H. plumaeforme.
19232310	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of a green-revertible albino gene gra(t) in rice.	2009	J Genet Genomics	Green-revertible albino is a novel type of chlorophyll deficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is helpful for further research in chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development to illuminate their molecular mechanism. In the previous study, we had reported a single recessive gene, gra(t), controlling this trait on the long arm of chromosome 2. In this paper, we mapped the gra(t) gene using 1,936 recessive individuals with albino phenotype in the F(2) population derived from the cross between themo-photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (T/PGMS) line Pei'ai 64S and the spontaneous mutant Qiufeng M. Eventually, it was located to a confined region of 42.4 kb flanked by two microsatellite markers RM2-97 and RM13553. Based on the annotation results of RiceGAAS system, 11 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in this region. Among them, ORF6 was the most possible gene related to chloroplast development, which encoded the chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor Tu in rice. Therefore, we designated it as the candidate gene of gra(t). Sequence analysis indicated that only one base substitution C to T occurred in the coding region, which caused a missense mutation (Thr to Ile) in gra(t) mutant. These results are very valuable for further study on gra(t) gene.
19232050	Role of OsHAL3 protein, a putative 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase in rice.	2009	Biochemistry (Mosc)	In this study, we cloned the OsHAL3 gene from rice Oryza sativa. Alignment analysis revealed that OsHAL3 has a high sequence identity to Dfp protein in Escherichia coli and AtHAL3a protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, which have 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPC-DC) activity. OsHAL3 can complement mutation in the E. coli dfp gene encoding PPC-DC, so that the mutant strains with OsHAL3 can grow on rich media at 42 degrees C and on VB minimal media at 30 degrees C. Complementation tests with point mutations of OsHAL3 suggested that the conserved Cys176 residue of OsHAL3 is a key active-site residue. The mutant OsHAL3 G180A has a partly reduced activity. Related mRNA-level analysis showed that the OsHAL3 gene is induced by calcium pantothenate in rice.
19229638	OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that may be involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification in both plants and animals. OsMT1a, encoding a type 1 metallothionein, was isolated via suppression subtractive hybridization from Brazilian upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Iapar 9). Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration. Interestingly, the OsMT1a expression was also induced specifically by Zn(2+) treatment. Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought. The examination of antioxidant enzyme activities demonstrated that catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were significantly elevated in transgenic plants. Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance.
19229294	The transcription factor OsNAC4 is a key positive regulator of plant hypersensitive cell death.	2009	EMBO J	The hypersensitive response (HR) is a common feature of plant immune responses and a type of programmed cell death. However, little is known about the induction mechanism of HR cell death. We report that overexpression of OsNAC4, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, leads to HR cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation and typical morphological changes. In OsNAC4 knock-down lines, HR cell death is markedly decreased in response to avirulent bacterial strains. After induction by an avirulent pathogen recognition signal, OsNAC4 is translocated into the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. A microarray analysis showed that the expression of 139 genes including OsHSP90 and IREN, encoding a Ca(2+)-dependent nuclease, were different between the OsNAC4 knock-down line and control line during HR cell death. During the induction of HR cell death, OsHSP90 is involved in the loss of plasma membrane integrity, whereas IREN causes nuclear DNA fragmentation. Overall, our results indicate that two important events occurring during HR cell death are regulated by independent pathways.
19225807	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2009	Planta	Environmental stresses limit plant growth and crop production worldwide. We attempted to isolate rice genes involved in conferring tolerance to environmental stresses by using a transgenic Arabidopsis population expressing full-length cDNAs of rice. Among these lines, a thermotolerant line, R08946, was detected. The rice cDNA inserted in R08946 encoded a NAC transcription factor, ONAC063. This protein was localized in the nucleus and showed transactivation activity at the C-terminus. ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots. High-osmotic pressure and reactive oxygen species levels also induced ONAC063 expression. The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure. Microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed upregulated expression of some salinity-inducible genes, including the amylase gene AMY1, in ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis. Thus, ONAC063 may play an important role in eliciting responses to high-salinity stress.
19224952	Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	OsNek3 (Oryza sativa L. NIMA-related kinase) and DCW11 encoding a mitochondrial putative protein phosphatase 2C were found in our previous microarray study as down-regulated genes in the rice CW-CMS line, which lacked pollen germination ability. Further analysis of DCW11 revealed that DCW11 is strongly correlated with CW-CMS occurrence. Here we show the relationship between OsNek3 and DCW11. OsNek3 was preferentially expressed in mature pollen. A knockout mutant with Tos17 inserted into OsNek3 did not show any pollen-defective phenotype. On the other hand, plants overexpressing OsNek3 occasionally produced a peculiar pollen structure in which the outer cell wall of four pollen grains fused together even at the mature pollen stages, which resembled that of quartet mutants in Arabidopsis. OsNek3 was shown to interact with a LIM domain-containing protein, OsPLIM2b, whose expression was strongly specific in mature pollen, suggesting that OsNek3 might play a role in pollen germination. OsNek3 was shown to be down-regulated in DCW11-knockdown lines, whereas osnek3 mutation did not result in DCW11 down-regulation. These results suggest that OsNek3 is downstream of DCW11 in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW-CMS.
19224195	Leaf-level water use efficiency determined by carbon isotope discrimination in rice seedlings: genetic variation associated with population structure and QTL mapping.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Increasing the water use efficiency (WUE) of our major crop species is an important target of agricultural research. Rice is a major water consumer in agriculture and it is also an attractive genetic model. We evaluated leaf-level WUE in young rice seedlings using carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) as an indicator of the trait. A survey of Delta(13)C was undertaken in 116 diverse germplasm accessions representing O. sativa, O. glaberrima and four wild Oryza species. O. sativa cultivars were classified into sub-populations based on SSR markers, and significant differences in Delta(13)C were observed among the five genetically defined groups. While individual accessions explained a greater proportion of the variation than did sub-population, indica rice varieties had the lowest Delta(13)C values overall, indicating superior WUE, while temperate japonica had the highest Delta(13)C. O sativa accessions had a similar or greater range of Delta(13)C values than wild Oryza species, while domesticated O. glaberrima had a narrower range. Correlation analysis identified leaf morphological and physiological traits that were significantly associated with Delta(13)C, including longer leaves, more drooping leaves, higher tillering ability, and lower leaf nitrogen content. These trait associations were investigated by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using backcross inbred lines derived from a cross between Nipponbare (temperate japonica) and Kasalath (aus). Seven QTL for Delta(13)C were identified using composite interval analysis, located in five chromosomal regions. The QTL with the largest additive effect came from Kasalath and co-localized with QTL for leaf length, tiller number and nitrogen content.
19220793	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a new member of the GRAS family, plays positive roles in brassinosteroid signaling in rice.	2009	Plant J	Rapid progress has been made regarding the understanding of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about BR signaling in monotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low-tillering (dlt) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map-based cloning. DLT encodes a new member of the plant-specific GRAS family. The dwarf phenotype of dlt is similar to BR-deficient or signaling mutants in rice. In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that dlt is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that DLT is involved in BR signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the dlt mutant indicated that DLT is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes. In addition, transcription of several other BR-regulated genes is altered in the dlt mutant. Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element. Taken together, these studies have enabled us to identify a new signaling component that is involved in several specific BR responses in rice.
19219608	The application of the mutated acetolactate synthase gene from rice as the selectable marker gene in the production of transgenic soybeans.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	We investigated selective culturing conditions for the production of transgenic soybeans. In this culturing system, we used the acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicide-resistance gene derived from rice (Os-mALS gene) as a selectable marker gene instead of that derived from bacteria, which interfered with the cultivation and practical usage of transgenic crops. T(1) soybeans grown from one regenerated plant after selection of the ALS-targeting pyrimidinyl carboxy (PC) herbicide bispyribac-sodium (BS) exhibited herbicide resistance, and the introduction and expression of the Os-mALS gene were confirmed by genetic analysis. The selective culturing system promoted by BS herbicide, in which the Os-mALS gene was used as a selectable marker, was proved to be applicable to the production of transgenic soybeans, despite the appearance of escaped soybean plants that did not contain the Os-mALS transgene.
19214808	Heterologous expression of a salinity and developmentally regulated rice cyclophilin gene (OsCyp2) in E. coli and S. cerevisiae confers tolerance towards multiple abiotic stresses.	2009	Mol Biotechnol	Cyclophilin 2 (OsCyp2) is a cytosolic member of immunophilin family from rice. We have isolated its full length cDNA (1,056 bp) with an open reading frame of 519 bp encoding a polypeptide of 172 amino acids and an estimated pI of 8.61. Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of the protein was determined using N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilidine as peptide substrate. It has a catalytic efficiency (K (cat)/K (m)) of 4.5 x 10(6)/(mol/l)/s, which is comparable to known cyclophilins from plants. Its activity is specifically inhibited by cyclosporin A, a macrolide drug inhibitor of cyclophilins. Transcript analysis showed it to be a developmentally and differentially regulated gene; showing changes in abundance at seedling, tillering and heading stage under non-stress and salinity stress conditions. Expression of OsCyp2 enhances the ability of Escherichia coli to survive under diverse abiotic stresses viz. salinity, high temperature, osmotic stress (mannitol) and oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)). OsCyp2 was able to complement the yeast mutant lacking native Cyp2 and also improved the growth of wild type yeast under above-mentioned stress conditions. Based on these results, we propose that OsCyp2 may serve as a 'suitable candidate' for raising transgenic plants for enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerance.
19214435	OsATG10b, an autophagosome component, is needed for cell survival against oxidative stresses in rice.	2009	Mol Cells	Autophagy degrades toxic materials and old organelles, and recycles nutrients in eukaryotic cells. Whereas the studies on autophagy have been reported in other eukaryotic cells, its functioning in plants has not been well elucidated. We analyzed the roles of OsATG10 genes, which are autophagy-related. Two rice ATG10 genes - OsATG10a and OsATG10b - share significant sequence homology (about 75%), and were ubiquitously expressed in all organs examined here. GUS assay indicated that OsATG10b was highly expressed in the mesophyll cells and vascular tissue of younger leaves, but its level of expression decreased in older leaves. We identified T-DNA insertional mutants in that gene. Those osatg10b mutants were sensitive to treatments with high salt and methyl viologen (MV). Monodansylcadaverine-staining experiments showed that the number of autophagosomes was significantly decreased in the mutants compared with the WT. Furthermore, the amount of oxidized proteins increased in MV-treated mutant seedlings. These results demonstrate that OsATG10b plays an important role in the survival of rice cells against oxidative stresses.
19211695	Methyl jasmonate reduces grain yield by mediating stress signals to alter spikelet development in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in plant development and the defense response. Transgenic overexpression of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase gene (AtJMT) linked to the Ubi1 promoter increased levels of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) by 6-fold in young panicles. Grain yield was greatly reduced in Ubi1:AtJMT plants due to a lower numbers of spikelets and lower filling rates than were observed for nontransgenic (NT) controls. Ubi1:AtJMT plants had altered numbers of spikelet organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicule, anther, and pistil. The loss of grain yield and alteration in spikelet organ numbers were reproduced by treating NT plants with exogenous MeJA, indicating that increased levels of MeJA in Ubi1:AtJMT panicles inhibited spikelet development. Interestingly, MeJA levels were increased by 19-fold in young NT panicles upon exposure to drought conditions, resulting in a loss of grain yield that was similar to that observed in Ubi1:AtJMT plants. Levels of abscisic acid (ABA) were increased by 1.9- and 1.4-fold in Ubi1:AtJMT and drought-treated NT panicles, respectively. The ABA increase in Ubi1:AtJMT panicles grown in nondrought conditions suggests that MeJA, rather than drought stress, induces ABA biosynthesis under drought conditions. Using microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, we identified seven genes that were regulated in both Ubi1:AtJMT and drought-treated NT panicles. Two genes, OsJMT1 and OsSDR (for short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase), are involved in MeJA and ABA biosynthesis, respectively, in rice (Oryza sativa). Overall, our results suggest that plants produce MeJA during drought stress, which in turn stimulates the production of ABA, together leading to a loss of grain yield.
19208695	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
19205894	Expression of a novel OSPGYRP (rice proline-, glycine- and tyrosine-rich protein) gene, which is involved in vesicle trafficking, enhanced cold tolerance in E. coli.	2009	Biotechnol Lett	A novel OSPGYRP gene encoding a rice proline-, glycine- and tyrosine-rich protein was isolated from cold-stress treated rice seedlings using suppression subtractive hybridization. Both amino acid sequence analysis and subcellular localization confirm that OsPGYRP is a novel protein involved in vesicle trafficking. The expression of the OSPGYRP gene was induced by cold, salt, and osmotic stress. In addition, expression of the OSPGYRP gene in E. coli increased the resistance to cold stress. These results show that OsPGYRP is a novel protein involved in vesicle trafficking and plays an important role in plant adaptation to stress.
19199048	A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) control several developmental processes including seed maturation, dormancy, and germination. The antagonism of these two hormones is well-documented. However, recent data from transcription profiling studies indicate that they can function as agonists in regulating the expression of many genes although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we report a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY24, which encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of both GA and ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsWRKY24 via particle bombardment-mediated transient expression in aleurone cells represses the expression of two reporter constructs: the beta-glucuronidase gene driven by the GA-inducible Amy32b alpha-amylase promoter (Amy32b-GUS) and the ABA-inducible HVA22 promoter (HVA22-GUS). OsWRKY24 is unlikely a general repressor because it has little effect on the expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a constitutive ubiquitin promoter (UBI-Luciferase). As to the GA signaling, OsWRKY24 differs from OsWRKY51 and -71, two negative regulators specifically function in the GA signaling pathway, in several ways. First, OsWRKY24 contains two WRKY domains while OsWRKY51 and -71 have only one; both WRKY domains are essential for the full repressing activity of OsWRKY24. Second, binding of OsWRKY24 to the Amy32b promoter appears to involve sequences in addition to the TGAC cores of the W-boxes. Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment. Together, these data demonstrate that OsWRKY24 is a novel type of transcriptional repressor that inhibits both GA and ABA signaling.
19198875	Functional characterization of rice OsDof12.	2009	Planta	DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) proteins are a large family of transcription factors involved in a variety of biological processes in plants. In rice, 30 different Dof genes have been identified through genome analysis. Here we report the functional characteristics of a rice Dof gene, OsDof12, which encodes a predicted Dof protein. The nuclear localization of OsDof12 was investigated by the transient expression assays of the OsDof12-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells. Trans-activation assays in a yeast one-hybrid system indicated that OsDof12 had transcriptional activity. RNA expression analyses showed that the expression of OsDof12 was not tissue-specific in general and fluctuated at different development stages in rice. In addition, OsDof12 was strongly inhibited by dark treatments. The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions. These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14.
19192388	OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor.	2009	BMB Rep	Three novel Class A genes that encode heat shock transcription factor (HSF) were cloned from Oryza Sativa L using a yeast hybrid method. The OsHSF7 gene was found to be rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response. Over-expression of OsHSF7 in transgenic Arabidopsis could not induced over the expression of most target heat stress-inducible genes of HSFs; however, the transcription of some HSF target genes was more abundant in transgenic plants following two hours of heat stress treatment. In addition, those transgenic plants also had a higher basal thermotolerance, but not acquired thermotolerance. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that OsHSF7 might play an important role in the response to high temperature. Specifically, these findings indicate that OsHSF7 may be useful in the production of transgenic monocots that can over-express protective genes such as HSPs in response to heat stress, which will enable such plants to tolerate high temperatures.

19190097	Characterization of pullulanase (PUL)-deficient mutants of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and the function of PUL on starch biosynthesis in the developing rice endosperm.	2009	J Exp Bot	Rice (Oryza sativa) allelic sugary1 (sug1) mutants defective in isoamylase 1 (ISA1) accumulate varying levels of starch and phytoglycogen in their endosperm, and the activity of a pullulanase-type of a debranching enzyme (PUL) was found to correlate closely with the severity of the sug1 phenotype. Thus, three PUL-deficient mutants were generated to investigate the function of PUL in starch biosynthesis. The reduction of PUL activity had no pleiotropic effects on the other enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis. The short chains (DP < or = 13) of amylopectin in PUL mutants were increased compared with that of the wild type, but the extent of the changes was much smaller than that of sug1 mutants. The alpha-glucan composition [amylose, amylopectin, water-soluble polysaccharide (WSP)] and the structure of the starch components (amylose and amylopectin) of the PUL mutants were essentially the same, although the average chain length of the B(2-3) chains of amylopectin in the PUL mutant was approximately 3 residues longer than that of the wild type. The double mutants between the PUL-null and mild sug1 mutants still retained starch in the outer layer of endosperm tissue, while the amounts of WSP and short chains (DP < or = 7) of amylopectin were higher than those of the sug1 mutant; this indicates that the PUL function partially overlaps with that of ISA1 and its deficiency has a much smaller effect on the synthesis of amylopectin than ISA1 deficiency and the variation of the sug1 phenotype is not significantly dependent on the PUL activities.
19187041	Identification of an active LTR retrotransposon in rice.	2009	Plant J	Transposable elements are ubiquitous components of plant genomes. When active, these mobile elements can induce changes in the genome at both the structural and functional levels. Availability of the complete genome sequence for several model plant species provides the opportunity to study TEs in plants at an unprecedented scale. In the case of rice, annotation of the genomic sequence of the variety Nipponbare has revealed that TE-related sequences form more than 25% of its genome. However, most of the elements found are inactive, either because of structural alterations or because they are the target of various silencing pathways. In this paper, we propose a new post-genomic strategy aimed at identifying active TEs. Our approach relies on transcript profiling of TE-related sequences using a tiling microarray. We applied it to a particular class of TEs, the LTR retrotransposons. A transcript profiling assay of rice calli led to identification of a new transpositionally active family, named Lullaby. We provide a complete structural description of this element. We also show that it has recently been active in planta in rice, and discuss its phylogenetic relationships with Tos17, the only other active LTR retrotransposon described so far in the species.
19184094	Phytochrome A requires jasmonate for photodestruction.	2009	Planta	The plant photoreceptor phytochrome is organised in a small gene family with phytochrome A (phyA) being unique, because it is specifically degraded upon activation by light. This so called photodestruction is thought to be important for dynamic aspects of sensing such as measuring day length or shading by competitors. Signal-triggered proteolytic degradation has emerged as central element of signal crosstalk in plants during recent years, but many of the molecular players are still unknown. We therefore analyzed a jasmonate (JA)-deficient rice mutant, hebiba, that in several aspects resembles a mutant affected in photomorphogenesis. In this mutant, the photodestruction of phyA is delayed as shown by in vivo spectroscopy and Western blot analysis. Application of methyl-JA (MeJA) can rescue the delayed phyA photodestruction in the mutant in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Light regulation of phyA transcripts thought to be under control of stable phytochrome B (phyB) is still functional. The delayed photodestruction is accompanied by an elevated sensitivity of phytochrome-dependent growth responses to red and far-red light.
19183860	The identification of candidate genes associated with Pch2 eyespot resistance in wheat using cDNA-AFLP.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Eyespot is a fungal disease of the stem base of cereal crops and causes lodging and the premature ripening of grain. Wheat cultivar Cappelle Desprez contains a highly durable eyespot resistance gene, Pch2 on the long arm of chromosome 7A. A cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) platform was used to identify genes differentially expressed between the eyespot susceptible variety Chinese Spring (CS) and the CS chromosome substitution line Cappelle Desprez 7A (CS/CD7A) which contains Pch2. Induced and constitutive gene expression was examined to compare differences between non-infected and plants infected with Oculimacula acuformis. Only 34 of approximately 4,700 cDNA-AFLP fragments were differentially expressed between CS and CS/CD7A. Clones were obtained for 29 fragments, of which four had homology to proteins involved with plant defence responses. Fourteen clones mapped to chromosome 7A and three of these mapped in the region of Pch2 making them putative candidates for involvement in eyespot resistance. Of particular importance are two fragments; 4CD7A8 and 19CD7A4, which have homology to an Oryza sativa putative callose synthase protein and a putative cereal cyst nematode NBS-LRR disease resistance protein (RCCN) respectively. Differential expression associated with Pch2 was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Of those genes tested, only four were differentially expressed at 14 days post inoculation. We therefore suggest that a majority of the differences in the cDNA-AFLP profiles are due to allelic polymorphisms between CS and CD alleles rather than differences in expression.
19183299	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Uptake and translocation of micronutrients are essential for plant growth. These micronutrients are also important food components. We generated transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRT1 to evaluate its functional roles in metal homeostasis. Those plants showed enhanced tolerance to iron deficiency at the seedling stage. In paddy fields, this over-expression caused plant architecture to be altered. In addition, those plants were sensitive to excess Zn and Cd, indicating that OsIRT1 also transports those metals. As expected, iron and zinc contents were elevated in the shoots, roots and mature seeds of over-expressing plants. This demonstrates that OsIRT1 can be used for enhancing micronutrient levels in rice grains.
19181865	Sucrose transporter1 functions in phloem loading in maize leaves.	2009	J Exp Bot	In most plants, sucrose is exported from source leaves to carbon-importing sink tissues to sustain their growth and metabolism. Apoplastic phloem-loading species require sucrose transporters (SUTs) to transport sucrose into the phloem. In many dicot plants, genetic and biochemical evidence has established that SUT1-type proteins function in phloem loading. However, the role of SUT1 in phloem loading in monocot plants is not clear since the rice (Oryza sativa) and sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid) SUT1 orthologues do not appear to function in phloem loading of sucrose. A SUT1 gene was previously cloned from maize (Zea mays) and shown to have expression and biochemical activity consistent with a hypothesized role in phloem loading. To determine the biological function of SUT1 in maize, a sut1 mutant was isolated and characterized. sut1 mutant plants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in mature leaves and display leaf chlorosis with premature senescence. In addition, sut1 mutants have greatly reduced stature, altered biomass partitioning, delayed flowering, and stunted tassel development. Cold-girdling wild-type leaves to block phloem transport phenocopied the sut1 mutants, supporting a role for maize SUT1 in sucrose export. Furthermore, application of (14)C-sucrose to abraded sut1 mutant and wild-type leaves showed that sucrose export was greatly diminished in sut1 mutants compared with wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SUT1 is crucial for efficient phloem loading of sucrose in maize leaves.
19179350	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Hd3a and FT proteins have recently been proposed to act as florigens in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively; however, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain to be determined. In this study, we identified GF14c (a 14-3-3 protein) as an Hd3a-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In vitro and in vivo experiments, using a combination of pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, confirmed the interaction between Hd3a and GF14c. Functional analysis using either GF14c overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of flowering. GF14c-overexpressing plants exhibited a delay in flowering and the knockout mutants displayed early flowering relative to the wild-type plants under short-day conditions. These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a. Since the 14-3-3 protein has been shown to interact with FT protein in tomato and Arabidopsis, our results in rice provide important findings about FT signaling in plants.
19179349	Constitutive expression of a trypsin protease inhibitor confers multiple stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Protease inhibitors have been reported to confer insect resistance in transgenic plants, except for a rice protease inhibitor that conferred drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants. We have cloned a protease inhibitor of tobacco that is expressed under treatment with ABA, hydrogen peroxide, methyl jasmonate and wounding. The cDNA codes for a six-domain serine protease inhibitor with a deduced sequence of 396 amino acids. We have generated transgenic tobacco plants expressing the protease inhibitor constitutively under the 35S promoter. When analyzed in the T(2) generation, these transgenic plants exhibited tolerance to sodium chloride, variable pH and sorbitol, together with the expected resistance to the insect pests Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera. The transgenic plants showed enhanced seed germination, root length and root-shoot ratio, significantly enhanced total chlorophyll content and reduced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances under stress. Under sodium chloride treatment, the transgenic plants have enhanced protease inhibitor activity. The transgenic plants exhibited a higher potassium content and an optimum Na+/K+ ratio. To our knowledge, this is the first report of transgenic plants with constitutive protease inhibitor expression showing tolerance to a wide range variable pH in the culture medium along with other stresses.
19175766	The CRABS CLAW ortholog from California poppy (Eschscholzia californica, Papaveraceae), EcCRC, is involved in floral meristem termination, gynoecium differentiation and ovule initiation.	2009	Plant J	The Arabidopsis transcription factor CRABS CLAW (CRC) is a major determinant of carpel growth and fusion, and, in concert with other redundantly acting genes, of floral meristem termination. Its rice ortholog, however, has additional functions in specifying carpel organ identity. We were interested in understanding the history of gene function modulation of CRC-like genes during angiosperm evolution. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of EcCRC, the Californica poppy (Eschscholzia californica) CRC ortholog. The downregulation of EcCRC by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) produces additional organ whorls that develop exclusively into gynoecia, resulting in a reiteration of the fourth whorl. Additionally, defects in carpel polarity and ovule initiation are apparent, and the observed phenotype is restricted to the gynoecium. Our results further show that the history of CRC-like genes during angiosperm evolution is characterized by gains of function, independent of duplication processes in this gene subfamily. Moreover, our data indicate that the ancestral angiosperm CRC-like gene was involved in floral meristem termination and the promotion of abaxial cell fate in the gynoecium, and that in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis, additional genes have been recruited to adopt some of these functions, resulting in a high degree of redundancy.
19161943	Expression of a rice OsARGOS gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size.	2009	J Genet Genomics	The ARGOS gene in Arabidopsis plays a key role in controlling plant organ size. To determine the function of it's ortholog in rice, a putative ARGOS orthologous gene from rice tissues was isolated and designated as OsARGOS. This gene has only one copy in the rice genome. OsARGOS transcripts were detected in most of rice tissues, particularly in the young tissues, and its expression was induced in rice seedlings by the application of either auxin or cytokinin. Arabidopsis plants expressing OsARGOS led to larger organs, such as leaves and siliques, compared with wild-type plants. Interestingly, the root growth was also enhanced in these transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Therefore, the biomass of the transgenic plants was significantly increased. Further analysis revealed that, different from the ARGOS and ARGOS-LIKE genes in Arabidopsis, the OsARGOS gene enlarged organ by an increase in both cell number and cell size. In addition, the transcript levels of several organ size-associated genes regulating either cell division or cell growth were upregulated in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. We also transferred the OsARGOS gene to rice, but the transgenic plants did not show any changes in organ size compared with the control plants. It is likely that the function of OsARGOS in organ size control depends on other size regulators in rice. The expression of OsARGOS in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development. Since the expression of OsARGOS causes organ enlargement, the potential application of this gene through genetic engineering may significantly improve the production of biomass in agricultural practice.
19161601	Differential effectiveness of Serratia plymuthica IC1270-induced systemic resistance against hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic leaf pathogens in rice.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Induced resistance is a state of enhanced defensive capacity developed by a plant reacting to specific biotic or chemical stimuli. Over the years, several forms of induced resistance have been characterized, including systemic acquired resistance, which is induced upon localized infection by an avirulent necrotizing pathogen, and induced systemic resistance (ISR), which is elicited by selected strains of nonpathogenic rhizobacteria. However, contrary to the relative wealth of information on inducible defense responses in dicotyledoneous plants, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying induced resistance phenomena in cereal crops is still in its infancy. Using a combined cytomolecular and pharmacological approach, we analyzed the host defense mechanisms associated with the establishment of ISR in rice by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica IC1270.

RESULTS: In a standardized soil-based assay, root treatment with IC1270 rendered foliar tissues more resistant to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. Analysis of the cytological and biochemical alterations associated with restriction of fungal growth in IC1270-induced plants revealed that IC1270 primes rice for enhanced attacker-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescent phenolic compounds in and near epidermal cells displaying dense cytoplasmic granulation. Similar, yet more abundant, phenotypes of hypersensitively dying cells in the vicinity of fungal hyphae were evident in a gene-for-gene interaction with an avirulent M. oryzae strain, suggesting that IC1270-inducible ISR and R protein conditioned effector-triggered immunity (ETI) target similar defense mechanisms. Yet, this IC1270-inducible ISR response seems to act as a double-edged sword within the rice defense network as induced plants displayed an increased vulnerability to the necrotrophic pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Cochliobolus miyabeanus. Artificial enhancement of ROS levels in inoculated leaves faithfully mimicked the opposite effects of IC1270 bacteria on aforementioned pathogens, suggesting a central role for oxidative events in the IC1270-induced resistance mechanism.

CONCLUSION: Besides identifying ROS as modulators of antagonistic defense mechanisms in rice, this work reveals the mechanistic similarities between S. plymuthica-mediated ISR and R protein-dictated ETI and underscores the importance of using appropriate innate defense mechanisms when breeding for broad-spectrum rice disease resistance.
19157639	Isolation and functional analysis of LiYAB1, a YABBY family gene, from lily (Lilium longiflorum).	2009	J Plant Physiol	YABBY family proteins are plant-specific transcriptional factors. YABBY genes can be divided into three subfamilies. Within the CRC/DL subfamily, the Arabidopsis CRC (CRABS CLAW) and the rice DL (DROOPING LEAF) have functionally diverged in the control of leaf development. CRC has no function in leaf development, while DL plays an important role in the formation of leaf midribs. In this study LiYAB1, an ortholog of CRC/DL genes from lily (Lilium longiflorum), was isolated by screening a cDNA library derived from young lily flower buds. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that LiYAB1 is nuclear localized. LiYAB1 is expressed strongly in the carpels of the lily flower and weakly in the leaves, which is similar to DL in rice. Ectopic expression of LiYAB1 in the rice dl mutant could rescue the drooping leaf phenotype of dl in some of the transgenic rice plants and cause abnormal leaves in the other transgenic plants. The overexpression of LiYAB1 in the wild-type Arabidopsis caused leaf abnormality. The results suggest that LiYAB1, a member of the CRC/DL subfamily genes, might have an important function in regulating the leaf development in lilies, as DL does in rice.
19154618	Evidence for separate translocation pathways in determining cadmium accumulation in grain and aerial plant parts in rice.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) translocation and accumulation in the grain and aerial plant parts of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important aspect of food safety and phytoextraction in areas with contaminated soil. Because control of Cd translocation and accumulation is likely to be determined by the plants genetics, the Cd contents of grain and the aerial parts of rice may be manipulated to improve food safety and for phytoextraction ability. This study studied Cd translocation and accumulation and their genetic control in aerial parts of rice to provide a starting point for improving food safety and phytoextraction in Cd-contaminated soils.

RESULTS: In the japonica rice cultivar "Nipponbare", Cd accumulated in leaves and culms until heading, and in culms and ears after heading. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from indica cv. "Kasalath", qcd4-1 and qcd4-2, affect Cd concentrations in upper plant parts just before heading. Three near-isogenic lines (NILs) with qcd4-1 and qcd4-2 were selected from the "Nipponbare" background, and were analyzed for the effects of each QTL, and for interactions between the two QTLs. From the results compared between "Nipponbare" and each NIL, neither QTL influenced total Cd accumulation in aerial parts at 5 days after heading, but the interaction between two QTLs increased Cd accumulation. At 35 days after heading, qcd4-2 had increased Cd accumulation in the aerial plant parts and decreased translocation from leaves other than flag leaf, but interaction between the two QTLs increased translocation from leaves. NILqcd4-1,2 accumulated higher concentrations of Cd in brown rice than "Nipponbare".

CONCLUSION: Three types of Cd translocation and accumulation patterns demonstrated by NILs suggested that the accumulation of Cd in leaves and culms before heading, and translocation from them after heading are responsible for Cd accumulation in grain. Cd translocation from roots to culms and ears after heading may direct Cd to the aerial organs without influencing brown rice accumulation.
19154227	The vacuolar processing enzyme OsVPE1 is required for efficient glutelin processing in rice.	2009	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates prolamines and glutelins as its major storage proteins. Glutelins are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum as 57-kDa precursors; they are then sorted into protein storage vacuoles where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. We report a novel rice glutelin mutant, W379, which accumulates higher levels of the 57-kDa glutelin precursor. Genetic analysis revealed that the W379 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified this gene, OsVPE1, which is a homolog of the Arabidopsis betaVPE gene. OsVPE1 encodes a 497-amino-acid polypeptide. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in W379 that changes Cys269 to Gly. Like the wild-type protein, the mutant protein is sorted into vacuoles; however, the enzymatic activity of the mutant OsVPE1 is almost completely eliminated. Further, we show that OsVPE1 is incorrectly cleaved, resulting in a mature protein that is smaller than the wild-type mature protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsVPE1 is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the maturation of rice glutelins. Further, OsVPE1 Cys269 is a key residue for maintaining the Asn-specific cleavage activity of OsVPE1.
19154200	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size.	2009	Plant J	The architecture of the rice inflorescence, which is determined mainly by the number and length of primary and secondary inflorescence branches, is of importance in both agronomy and developmental biology. The position and number of primary branches are established during the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and several of the genes identified as participating in this process do so by regulating the meristemic activities of inflorescence. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that controls inflorescence branch elongation. Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (sp1), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short-panicle phenotype. Gene cloning and characterization indicate that SP1 encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family. This conclusion is based on the findings that SP1 contains a conserved PTR2 domain consisting of 12 transmembrane domains, and that the SP1-GFP fusion protein is localized in the plasma membrane. The SP1 gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of SP1 and the sp1 phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter. However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant.
19153709	Identification and mapping of Pi41, a major gene conferring resistance to rice blast in the Oryza sativa subsp. indica reference cultivar, 93-11.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	The Oryza sativa subsp. indica reference cultivar (cv.), 93-11 is completely resistant to many Chinese isolates of the rice blast fungus. Resistance segregated in a 3:1 (resistance/susceptible) ratio in an F(2) population from the cross between 93-11 and the japonica reference cv. Nipponbare, when challenged with two independent blast isolates. The chromosomal location of this monogenic resistance was mapped to a region of the long arm of chromosome 12 by bulk segregant analysis, using 180 evenly distributed SSR markers. Five additional SSR loci and nine newly developed PCR-based markers allowed the target region to be reduced to ca. 1.8 cM, equivalent in Nipponbare to about 800 kb. In the reference sequence of Nipponbare, this region includes an NBS-LRR cluster of four genes. The known blast resistance gene Pi-GD-3 also maps in this region, but the 93-11 resistance was distinguishable from Pi-GD-3 on the basis of race specificity. We have therefore named the 93-11 resistance Pi41. Seven markers completely linked to Pi41 will facilitate both marker-assisted breeding and gene isolation cloning.
19153708	Four rice QTL controlling number of spikelets per panicle expressed the characteristics of single Mendelian gene in near isogenic backgrounds.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) near isogenic lines is a crucial step to QTL isolation using the strategy of map-based cloning. In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from two indica rice varieties, Zhenshan 97 and HR5, was employed to map QTL for spikelets per panicle (SPP). One major QTL (qSPP7) and three minor QTL (qSPP1, qSPP2 and qSPP3) were identified on chromosomes 7, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Four sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) BC(4)F(2) targeted for the four QTL were developed by following a standard procedure of consecutive backcross, respectively. These QTL were not only validated in corresponding NILs, but also explained amounts of phenotypic variation with much larger LOD scores compared with those identified in RILs. SPP in the four QTL-NILs expressed bimodal or discontinuous distributions and followed the expected segregation ratio of single Mendelian factor by progeny test. Finally, qSPP1, qSPP2, qSPP3 and qSPP7 were respectively mapped to a locus, 0.5 cM from MRG2746, 0.6 cM from MRG2762, 0.8 cM from RM49 and 0.7 cM from MRG4436, as co-dominant markers on the basis of progeny tests. These results indicate no matter how small effect minor QTL is, QTL may still express the characteristics of single Mendelian factor in NILs and isolation of minor QTL will be possible using high quality NILs. Pyramiding these QTL into a variety will largely enhance rice grain yield.
19152316	Solution structure of the DNA binding domain of rice telomere binding protein RTBP1.	2009	Biochemistry	RTBP1 is a rice telomeric protein that binds to the duplex array of TTTAGGG repeats at chromosome ends. The DNA binding domain of RTBP1 contains a Myb-type DNA binding motif and a highly conserved C-terminal Myb extension that is unique to plant telomeric proteins. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we identified the C-terminal 110-amino acid region (RTBP1(506-615)) as the minimal telomeric DNA binding domain, suggesting that the Myb extension is required for binding plant telomeric DNA. Like other telomeric proteins such as human TRF1 and yeast Rap1, RTBP1 induced a DNA bending in the telomeric repeat sequence, suggesting that RTBP1 may play a role in establishing and/or maintaining an active telomere configuration in vivo. To elucidate the DNA binding mode of RTBP1, we determined the three-dimensional structure of RTBP1(506-615) in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure of RTBP1(506-615) is composed of four alpha-helices and stabilized by three hydrophobic patches. The second and third helices in RTBP1 form a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts directly with DNA. The fourth helix located in the Myb extension is essential for binding to telomeric DNA via stabilization of the overall structure of the RTBP1 DNA binding domain. When DNA bound to RTBP1(506-615), large chemical shift perturbations were induced in the N-terminal arm, helix 3, and the loop between helices 3 and 4. These results suggest that helix 3 functions as a sequence-specific recognition helix while the N-terminal arm stabilizes the DNA binding.
19060383	Functional identification of a rice ent-kaurene oxidase, OsKO2, using the Pichia pastoris expression system.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rice ent-kaurene oxidase 2 (OsKO2) perhaps functions in the early steps of gibberellin biosynthesis. We found that microsomes from the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris expressing both OsKO2 and a fungal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) reductase converted ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid. This is direct evidence that OsKO2 is involved in the sequential oxidation of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid in gibberellin biosynthesis in rice.
19055717	Identification of precursor transcripts for 6 novel miRNAs expands the diversity on the genomic organisation and expression of miRNA genes in rice.	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The plant miRNAs represent an important class of endogenous small RNAs that guide cleavage of an mRNA target or repress its translation to control development and adaptation to stresses. MiRNAs are nuclear-encoded genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, producing a primary precursor that is subsequently processed by DCL1 an RNase III Dicer-like protein. In rice hundreds of miRNAs have been described or predicted, but little is known on their genes and precursors which are important criteria to distinguish them from siRNAs. Here we develop a combination of experimental approaches to detect novel miRNAs in rice, identify their precursor transcripts and genes and predict or validate their mRNA targets.

RESULTS: We produced four cDNA libraries from small RNA fractions extracted from distinct rice tissues. By in silico analysis we selected 6 potential novel miRNAs, and confirmed that their expression requires OsDCL1. We predicted their targets and used 5'RACE to validate cleavage for three of them, targeting a PPR, an SPX domain protein and a GT-like transcription factor respectively. In addition, we identified precursor transcripts for the 6 miRNAs expressed in rice, showing that these precursors can be efficiently processed using a transient expression assay in transfected Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Most interestingly, we describe two precursors producing tandem miRNAs, but in distinct arrays. We focus on one of them encoding osa-miR159a.2, a novel miRNA produced from the same stem-loop structure encoding the conserved osa-miR159a.1. We show that this dual osa-miR159a.2-osa-miR159a.1 structure is conserved in distant rice species and maize. Finally we show that the predicted mRNA target of osa-miR159a.2 encoding a GT-like transcription factor is cleaved in vivo at the expected site.

CONCLUSION: The combination of approaches developed here identified six novel miRNAs expressed in rice which can be clearly distinguished from siRNAs. Importantly, we show that two miRNAs can be produced from a single precursor, either from tandem stem-loops or tandemly arrayed in a single stem-loop. This suggests that processing of these precursors could be an important regulatory step to produce one or more functional miRNAs in plants and perhaps coordinate cleavage of distinct targets in the same plant tissue.
19017488	Structure and expression analysis of the OsCam1-1 calmodulin gene from Oryza sativa L.	2008	BMB Rep	Calmodulin (CaM) proteins, members of the EF-hand family of Ca(2+)- binding proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium signals. Here, OsCam1-1 was isolated by PCR amplification from the rice genome. The gene contains an ORF of 450 base pairs with a single intron at the same position found in other plant Cam genes. A promoter region with a TATA box at position-26 was predicted and fused to a gus reporter gene, and this construct was used to produce transgenic rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. GUS activity was observed in all organs examined and throughout tissues in cross-sections, but activity was strongest in the vascular bundles of leaves and the vascular cylinders of roots. To examine the properties of OsCaM1-1, the encoding cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca(2+) indicates that recombinant OsCaM1-1 is a functional Ca(2+)-binding protein. In addition, OsCaM1-1 bound the CaMKII target peptide confirming its likely functionality as a calmodulin.
19014580	Transfer of rice mitochondrial ribosomal protein L6 gene to the nucleus: acquisition of the 5'-untranslated region via a transposable element.	2008	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: The mitochondria of contemporary organisms contain fewer genes than the ancestral bacteria are predicted to have contained. Because most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, the genes would have been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus at some stage of evolution and they must have acquired cis-regulatory elements compatible with eukaryotic gene expression. However, most of such processes remain unknown.

RESULTS: The ribosomal protein L6 gene (rpl6) has been lost in presently-known angiosperm mitochondrial genomes. We found that each of the two rice rpl6 genes (OsRpl6-1 and OsRpl6-2) has an intron in an identical position within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), which suggests a duplication of the rpl6 gene after its transfer to the nucleus. Each of the predicted RPL6 proteins lacks an N-terminal extension as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Transient assays using green fluorescent protein indicated that their mature N-terminal coding regions contain the mitochondrial targeting information. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that OsRpl6-2 expresses considerably fewer transcripts than OsRpl6-1. This might be the result of differences in promoter regions because the 5'-noncoding regions of the two rpl6 genes differ at a point close to the center of the intron. There are several sequences homologous to the region around the 5'-UTR of OsRpl6-1 in the rice genome. These sequences have characteristics similar to those of the transposable elements (TE) belonging to the PIF/Harbinger superfamily.

CONCLUSION: The above evidences suggest a novel mechanism in which the 5'-UTR of the transferred mitochondrial gene was acquired via a TE. Since the 5'-UTRs and introns within the 5'-UTRs often contain transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-elements, the transferred rice mitochondrial rpl6 gene may have acquired its cis-element from a TE.
19011360	Scavenging reactive oxygen species by rice dehydroascorbate reductase alleviates oxidative stresses in Escherichia coli.	2008	Mol Cells	Maintaining redox balance is one of the crucial requirements for a cell to endure stress from the outside. Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR; EC 1.8.5.1) plays an important role in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle; one of the major ROS scavenging systems in most known biological systems. A cDNA clone of the DHAR gene from Oryza sativa (OsDHAR) was isolated and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain from the pET-28a(+) expression vector. The OsDHAR transformed E. coli cells showed significantly higher DHAR activity and a lower level of ROS than the E. coli cells transformed by an empty pET-28a(+) vector. Also, the DHAR-overexpressing E. coli strain was more tolerant to oxidant- and heavy metal-mediated stress conditions than the control E. coli strain. The results suggest that the overexpressed rice DHAR gene effectively functions in a prokaryotic system and provide protection to various oxidative stresses.
18953406	OsLIC, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein with Transcription Activation, Mediates Rice Architecture via Brassinosteroids Signaling.	2008	PLoS One	Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major limiting factor for its high productivity. Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativaleaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture. OsLIC encoded an ancestral and unique CCCH type zinc finge protein. It has many orthologous in other organisms, ranging from yeast to humane. Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice. OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud. Genetic analysis suggested that OsLIC is epistatic to d2-1, whereas d61-1 is epistatic to OsLIC. Interestingly, sterols were significantly higher in level in transgenic shoots than in the wild type. Genome-wide expression analysis indicated that brassinosteroids (BRs) signal transduction was activated in transgenic lines. Moreover, transcription of OsLIC was induced by 24-epibrassinolide. OsLIC, with a single CCCH motif, displayed binding activity to double-stranded DNA and single-stranded polyrA, polyrU and polyrG but not polyrC. It contains a novel conserved EELR domain among eukaryotes and displays transcriptional activation activity in yeast. OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture.
18946700	Enhanced thermotolerance of E. coli by expressed OsHsp90 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Curr Microbiol	A gene encoding the rice (Oryza sativa L.) 90-kDa heat shock protein (OsHsp90) was introduced into Escherichia coli using the pGEX-6p-3 expression vector with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag to analyze the possible function of this protein under heat stress for the first time. We compared the survivability of E. coli (BL21) cells transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing GST-OsHsp90 fusion protein with control E. coli cells transformed with the plasmid containing GST and the wild type BL21 under heat shock after isopropyl beta-D: -thiogalactopyranoside induction. Cells expressing GST-OsHsp90 demonstrated thermotolerance at 42, 50, and 70 degrees C, treatments that were more harmful to cells expressing GST and the wild type. Further studies were carried out to analyze the heat-induced characteristics of OsHsp90 at 42, 50, and 70 degrees C in vitro. When cell lysates from E. coli transformants were heated at these heat stresses, expressed GST-OsHsp90 prevented the denaturation of bacterial proteins treated with 42 degrees C heat shocks, and partially prevented that of proteins treated at 50 and 70 degrees C; meanwhile, cells expressing GST-OsHsp90 withstood the duration at 50 degrees C. These results indicate that OsHsp90 functioned as a chaperone, binding to a subset of substrates, and maintained E. coli growth well at high temperatures.
18840300	RNAi-directed downregulation of OsBADH2 results in aroma (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline) production in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Aromatic rice is popular worldwide because of its characteristic fragrance. Genetic studies and physical fine mapping reveal that a candidate gene (fgr/OsBADH2) homologous to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for aroma metabolism in fragrant rice varieties, but the direct evidence demonstrating the functions of OsBADH2 is lacking. To elucidate the physiological roles of OsBADH2, sequencing approach and RNA interference (RNAi) technique were employed to analyze allelic variation and functions of OsBADH2 gene in aroma production. Semi-quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as well as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were conducted to determine the expression levels of OsBADH2 and the fragrant compound in wild type and transgenic OsBADH2-RNAi repression lines, respectively.

RESULTS: The results showed that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele occur in the 13 fragrant rice accessions across China; OsBADH2 is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots; the disrupted OsBADH2 by RNA interference leads to significantly increased 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production.

CONCLUSION: We have found that the altered expression levels of OsBADH2 gene influence aroma accumulation, and the prevalent aromatic allele probably has a single evolutionary origin.
18811733	Loss of cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase limits photosynthetic sucrose synthesis and causes severe growth retardations in rice (Oryza sativa).	2008	Plant Cell Environ	During photosynthesis, triose-phosphates (trioseP) exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol are converted to sucrose via cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase). Expression analysis in rice suggests that OscFBP1 plays a major role in the cytosolic conversion of trioseP to sucrose in leaves during the day. The isolated OscFBP1 mutants exhibited markedly decreased photosynthetic rates and severe growth retardation with reduced chlorophyll content, which results in plant death. Analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed both significantly reduced levels of sucrose, glucose, fructose and starch in leaves of these mutants, and a high accumulation of sucrose to starch in leaves of rice plants. In the oscfbp1 mutants, products of glycolysis and the TCA cycle were significantly increased. A partitioning experiment of (14)C-labelled photoassimilates revealed altered carbon distributions including a slight increase in the insoluble fraction representing transitory starch, a significant decrease in the neutral fraction corresponding to soluble sugars and a high accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates and carboxylic acid fractions in the oscfbp1 mutants. These results indicate that the impaired synthesis of sucrose in rice cannot be sufficiently compensated for by the transitory starch-mediated pathways that have been found to facilitate plant growth in the equivalent Arabidopsis mutants.
18804072	Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase OsCIPK23 functions in pollination and drought stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	J Genet Genomics	Drought is very harmful to grain yield due to its adverse effect on reproduction, especially on pollination process in rice. However, the molecular basis of such an effect still remains largely unknown. Here, we report the role of a member of CBL (Calcineurin B-Like) Interacting Protein Kinase (CIPK) family, OsCIPK23, in pollination and stress responses in rice. Molecular analyses revealed that it is mainly expressed in pistil and anther but up-regulated by pollination, as well as by treatments of various abiotic stresses and phytohormones. RNA interference-mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress. In consistent, overexpression of OsCIPK23 induced the expression of several drought tolerance related genes. Taken together, these results indicate that OsCIPK23 is a multistress induced gene and likely mediates a signaling pathway commonly shared by both pollination and drought stress responses in rice.
18796165	Sense and antisense OsDof12 transcripts in rice.	2008	BMC Mol Biol	BACKGROUND: Antisense transcription is a widespread phenomenon in plants and mammals. Our previous data on rice gene expression analysis by microarray indicated that the sense and antisense transcripts at the OsDof12 locus were co-expressed in leaves. In current study, we analyzed the expression patterns in detail and looked for the possible mechanism related to their expression patterns.

RESULTS: OsDof12, being a single copy gene located on rice chromosome 3, encodes a predicted Dof protein of 440 amino acids with one intron of 945 bp. The antisense transcript, OsDofl2os, overlaps with both the exonic and intronic regions of OsDof12 and encodes a functionally unknown protein of 104 amino acids with no intron. The sense-antisense OsDof12 transcripts were co-expressed within the same tissues, and their expressions were not tissue-specific in general. At different developmental stages in rice, the OsDof12 and OsDof12os transcripts exhibited reciprocal expression patterns. Interestingly, the expression of both genes was significantly induced under drought treatment, and inhibited by dark treatment. In the ProOsDof12-GUS and ProOsDof12os-GUS transgenic rice plants, the expression profiles of GUS were consistent with those of the OsDof12 and OsDof12os transcripts, respectively. In addition, the analysis of cis-regulatory elements indicated that either of the two promoters contained 74 classes of cis-regulatory elements predicted, of which the two promoter regions shared 53 classes.

CONCLUSION: Based on the expression profiles of OsDof12 and OsDof12os, the expression patterns of GUS in the ProOsDof12-GUS and ProOsDof12os-GUS transgenic rice plants and the predicted common cis-regulatory elements shared by the two promoters, we suggest that the co-expression patterns of OsDof12 and OsDof12os might be attributed to the basically common nature of the two promoters.
18779926	Over-expression of OsDREB genes lead to enhanced drought tolerance in rice.	2008	Biotechnol Lett	The DREB transcription factors, which specifically interact with C-repeat/DRE (A/GCCGAC), play an important role in plant abiotic stress tolerance by controlling the expression of many cold or/and drought-inducible genes in an ABA-independent pathway. We have isolated three novel rice DREB genes, OsDREB1E, OsDREB1G, and OsDREB2B, which are homologous to Arabidopsis DREB genes. The yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that OsDREB1E, OsDREB1G, and OsDREB2B can specifically bind to the C-repeat/DRE element. To elucidate the function of respective OsDREB genes, we have stably introduced these to rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic rice plants analysis revealed that over-expression of OsDREB1G and OsDREB2B in rice significantly improved their tolerance to water deficit stress, while over-expression of OsDREB1E could only slightly improved the tolerance to water deficit stress, suggesting that the OsDREBs might participate in the stress response pathway in different manners.
18779180	[Genetic analysis and mapping of a rice white midrib mutant Oswm2].	2008	Yi Chuan	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant with white midrib (Oswm2) was selected from the T-DNA inserted mutant pool of rice. The basal midrib of the leaves in the mutant, except for the flag leaves, is white. The blade close to the white midrib is etiolated, and alterations of the agronomic traits, such as plant height, panicle length occur in the mutant. Genetic analysis indicated that this mutant trait was controlled by a recessive nuclear gene. To map the OsWM2 gene, an F2 population was constructed by crossing mutant Oswm2 with 02428. The OsWM2 locus was preliminarily located between the SSR molecular markers RM21478 and RM418 on chromosome 7 with the distances of 8.7 and 15.9 cM, respectively.
18779157	[Cultivation of transgenic rice plants with OsCDPK7 gene and its salt tolerance].	2008	Yi Chuan	A 1,700 bp DNA fragment, OsCDPK7 gene, was cloned with RT-PCR from liaoyan241 leaf treated under a low temperature of 4. Compared to the OsCDPK7 gene reported before (GenBank accession No. AB042550), this fragment, lack of 26 amino acids, possesses the activity of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase because of a complete integration of the Ca2+ binding structure domain and Ser/Thr protein kinase activity center. Plant expression vector was constructed,, OsCDPK7 gene was regulated by E12 promoter. OsCDPK7 gene was transferred into rice via Agrobacterium-mediated method. After Km screening and Southern blot, 10 transgenic plants were obtained. The analysis on the salt tolerance showed that the expression of OsCDPK7 gene composition enhanced the salt tolerance of T2 transgenic plants, part of T2 transgenic seeds could germinate in 0.2 mol/L NaCl medium, and T2 transgenic young plants could rejuvenate after treatment with 0.4 mol/L NaCl for 10 days, while the controlled plants could not germinate and died in salt stress. This research finding proved that the regulation factor of the plant signal transduction could enhance the salt tolerance of transgenic plants, while OsCDPK7 expression was different in the different tolerence transgenic plants.
18765925	Crystallographic characterization of the N-terminal domain of a plant NADPH oxidase.	2008	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Respiratory burst oxidase homologue (Rboh), which is found in the plasma membrane, is a generator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Many studies have indicated that the ROS produced by Rboh play critical roles in various cellular activities, including plant defence against pathogens. Crystals of the N-terminal domain of Oryza sativa RbohB (OsRbohB) have been obtained. The crystals belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 60.4, b = 72.2, c = 118.9 A. An intensity data set was collected to 2.4 A resolution.
18755073	Identification and characterization of a rice MCM2 homologue required for DNA replication.	2008	BMB Rep	The pre-replication complex (pre-RC), including the core hexameric MCM2-7 complex, ensures that the eukaryotic genome is replicated only once per cell division cycle. In this study, we identified a rice minichromosome maintenance (MCM) homologue (OsMCM2) that functionally complemented fission yeast MCM2 (CDC19) mutants. We found OsMCM2 transcript expression in roots, leaves, and seeds, although expression levels differed slightly among the organs. Likewise, the OsMCM2 protein was ubiquitously expressed, but it was downregulated when nutritients were limiting, indicating that MCM2 expression (and therefore cell cycle progression) requires adequate nutrition. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that OsMCM2 interacted with the COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5). Taken as a whole, our results indicated that OsMCM2 functions as a subunit of the rice MCM complex and interacts with CSN5 during developmental regulation.
18721784	Comparison of QTLs for rice seedling morphology under different water supply conditions.	2008	J Genet Genomics	The variation of seedling characteristics under different water supply conditions is strongly associated with drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and a better elucidation of its genetics is helpful for improving rice drought resistance. Ninetysix doubled-haploid (DH) rice lines of an indica and japonica cross were grown in both flooding and upland conditions and QTLs for morphological traits at seedling stage were examined using 208 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and 76 microsatellite (SSR) markers. A total of 32 putative QTLs were associated with the four seedling traits: average of three adventitious root lengths (ARL), shoot height (SH), shoot biomass (SW), and root to shoot dry weight ratio (RSR). Five QTLs detected were the same under control and upland conditions. The ratio between the mean value of the seedling trait under upland and flooding conditions was used for assessing drought tolerance. A total of six QTLs for drought tolerance were detected. Comparative analysis was performed for the QTLs detected in this case and those reported from two other populations with the same upland rice variety Azucena as parent. Several identical QTLs for seedling elongation across the three populations with the positive alleles from the upland rice Azucena were detected, which suggests that the alleles of Azucena might be involved in water stress-accelerated elongation of rice under different genetic backgrounds. Five cell wall-related candidate genes for OsEXP1, OsEXP2, OsEXP4, EXT, and EGase were mapped on the intervals carrying the QTLs for seedling traits.
18713381	Cell-wall invertases from rice are differentially expressed in Caryopsis during the grain filling stage.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Cell-wall invertase plays an important role in sucrose partitioning between source and sink organs in higher plants. To investigate the role of cell-wall invertases for seed development in rice (Oryza sativa L.), cDNAs of three putative cell-wall invertase genes OsCIN1, OsCIN2 and OsCIN3 were isolated. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed different expression patterns of the three genes in various rice tissues/organs. In developing caryopses, they exhibited similar temporal expression patterns, expressed highly at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declined to low levels afterward. However, the spatial expression patterns of them were very different, with OsCIN1 primarily expressed in the caryopsis coat, OsCIN2 in embryo and endosperm, and OsCIN3 in embryo. Further RNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that a strong signal of OsCIN2 mRNA was detected in the vascular parenchyma surrounding the xylem of the chalazal vein and the aleurone layer, whereas OsCIN3 transcript was strongly detected in the vascular parenchyma surrounding the phloem of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, the aleurone layer and the nucellar tissue. These data indicate that the three cell-wall invertase genes play complementary/synergetic roles in assimilate unloading during the grain filling stage. In addition, the cell type-specific expression patterns of OsCIN3 in source leaf blades and anthers were also investigated, and its corresponding physiological roles were discussed.
18713378	Gene structure and expression of the high-affinity nitrate transport system in rice roots.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice has a preference for uptake of ammonium over nitrate and can use ammonium-N efficiently. Consequently, transporters mediating ammonium uptake have been extensively studied, but nitrate transporters have been largely ignored. Recently, some reports have shown that rice also has high capacity to acquire nitrate from growth medium, so understanding the nitrate transport system in rice roots is very important for improving N use efficiency in rice. The present study identified four putative NRT2 and two putative NAR2 genes that encode components of the high-affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) in the rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) genome. OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 share an identical coding region sequence, and their deduced proteins are closely related to those from mono-cotyledonous plants. The two NAR2 proteins are closely related to those from mono-cotyledonous plants as well. However, OsNRT2.3 and OsNRT2.4 are more closely related to Arabidopsis NRT2 proteins. Relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that all of the six genes were rapidly upregulated and then downregulated in the roots of N-starved rice plants after they were re-supplied with 0.2 mM nitrate, but the response to nitrate differed among gene members. The results from phylogenetic tree, gene structure and expression analysis implied the divergent roles for the individual members of the rice NRT2 and NAR2 families. High-affinity nitrate influx rates associated with nitrate induction in rice roots were investigated and were found to be regulated by external pH. Compared with the nitrate influx rates at pH 6.5, alkaline pH (pH 8.0) inhibited nitrate influx, and acidic pH (pH 5.0) enhanced the nitrate influx in 1 h nitrate induced roots, but did not significantly affect that in 4 to 8 h nitrate induced roots.
18676379	Identification of maize silicon influx transporters.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Maize (Zea mays L.) shows a high accumulation of silicon (Si), but transporters involved in the uptake and distribution have not been identified. In the present study, we isolated two genes (ZmLsi1 and ZmLsi6), which are homologous to rice influx Si transporter OsLsi1. Heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that both ZmLsi1 and ZmLsi6 are permeable to silicic acid. ZmLsi1 was mainly expressed in the roots. By contrast, ZmLsi6 was expressed more in the leaf sheaths and blades. Different from OsLsi1, the expression level of both ZmLsi1 and ZmLsi6 was unaffected by Si supply. Immunostaining showed that ZmLsi1 was localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of root epidermal and hypodermal cells in the seminal and crown roots, and also in cortex cells in lateral roots. In the shoots, ZmLsi6 was found in the xylem parenchyma cells that are adjacent to the vessels in both leaf sheaths and leaf blades. ZmLsi6 in the leaf sheaths and blades also exhibited polar localization on the side facing towards the vessel. Taken together, it can be concluded that ZmLsi1 is an influx transporter of Si, which is responsible for the transport of Si from the external solution to the root cells and that ZmLsi6 mainly functions as a Si transporter for xylem unloading.
18668337	In trangenic rice, alpha- and beta-tubulin regulatory sequences control GUS amount and distribution through intron mediated enhancement and intron dependent spatial expression.	2009	Transgenic Res	The genomic upstream sequence of the rice tubulin gene OsTub6 has been cloned, sequenced and characterized. The 5'UTR sequence is interrupted by a 446 bp long leader intron. This feature is shared with two other rice beta-tubulin genes (OsTub4 and OsTub1) that, together with OsTub6, group in the same clade in the evolutionary phylogenetic tree of plant beta-tubulins. Similarly to OsTub4, the leader intron of OsTub6 is capable of sustaining intron mediated enhancement (IME) of gene expression, in transient expression assays. A general picture is drawn for three rice alpha-tubulin and two rice beta-tubulin genes in which the first intron of the coding sequence for the formers and the intron present in the 5'UTR for the latters, are important elements for controlling gene expression. We used OsTua2:GUS, OsTua3:GUS, OsTub4:GUS and OsTub6:GUS chimeric constructs to investigate the in vivo pattern of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression in transgenic rice plants. The influence of the regulatory introns on expression patterns was evaluated for two of them, OsTua2 and OsTub4. We have thus characterized distinct patterns of expression attributable to each tubulin isotype and we have shown that the presence of the regulatory intron can greatly influence both the amount and the actual site of expression. We propose the term Intron Dependent Spatial Expression (IDSE) to highlight this latter effect.
18666953	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing results indicate they are 1,531 bp and 1,635 bp in length including complete open reading frame 1,506 bp and 1,608 bp, which encode 502 amino acids and 536 amino acids, respectively. The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the gene expression patterns of OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z. In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated. In reproductive organs, both transcripts of these two genes were high in panicles from the booting stage to 7 days after flowering (DAF) and then sharply declined. The potential physiology functions of these two sucrose transporters are discussed.
18603363	Effect of different N fertilizer forms on antioxidant capacity and grain yield of rice growing under Cd stress.	2009	J Hazard Mater	Cadmium contamination in soil has become a serious issue in sustainable agriculture production and food safety. A pot experiment was conducted to study the influence of four N fertilizer forms on grain yield, Cd concentration in plant tissues and oxidative stress under two Cd levels (0 and 100 mg Cd kg(-1)soil). The results showed that both N form and Cd stress affected grain yield, with urea-N and NH(4)(+)-N treatments having significantly higher grain yields, and Cd addition reducing yield. NO(3)(-)-N and NH(4)(+)-N treated plants had the highest and lowest Cd concentration in plant tissues, respectively. Urea-N and NH(4)(+)-N treatments had significantly higher N accumulation in plant tissues than other two N treatments. Cd addition caused a significant increase in leaf superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities for all N treatments, except for NO(3)(-)-N treatment, with urea-N and NH(4)(+)-N treated plants having more increase than organic-N treated ones. The results indicated that growth inhibition, yield reduction and Cd uptake of rice plants in response to Cd addition varied with the N fertilizer form.
18594887	Transcriptome map for seedling stage specific salinity stress response indicates a specific set of genes as candidate for saline tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	2009	Funct Integr Genomics	Oryza sativa L. cv IR64 is a widely cultivated, salt-sensitive indica rice, while Pokkali is a well-known, naturally salt-tolerant relative. To understand the molecular basis of differences in their salinity tolerance, three subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed. A total of 1,194 salinity-regulated cDNAs are reported here that may serve as repositories for future individual gene-based functional genomics studies. Gene expression data using macroarrays and Northern blots gives support to our hypothesis that salinity tolerance of Pokkali may be due to constitutive overexpression of many genes that function in salinity tolerance and are stress inducible in IR64. Analysis of genome architecture revealed the presence of these genes on all the chromosomes with several distinct clusters. Notably, a few mapped on one of the major quantitative trait loci - Saltol - on chromosome 1 and were found to be differentially regulated in the two contrasting genotypes. The present study also defines a set of known abiotic stress inducible genes, including CaMBP, GST, LEA, V-ATPase, OSAP1 zinc finger protein, and transcription factor HBP1B, that were expressed at high levels in Pokkali even in the absence of stress. These proposed genes may prove useful as "candidates" in improving salinity tolerance in crop plants using transgenic approach.
18593528	Characterization of two plasma membrane protein 3 genes (PutPMP3) from the alkali grass, Puccinellia tenuiflora, and functional comparison of the rice homologues, OsLti6a/b from rice.	2008	BMB Rep	Two full-length cDNAs, PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, encoding PMP3 family proteins were isolated from Puccinellia tenuiflora, a monocotyledonous halophyte. Expression of both genes was induced by low temperature, salt stress, dehydration, ABA, and NaHCO(3). Transcripts of PutPMP3-2 were more strongly induced by these stresses relative to those of PutPMP3-1, particularly under low temperature and dehydration conditions. Expression of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2 in yeast mutants lacking the PMP3 gene can functionally complement the membrane hyperpolarization and salt sensitivity phenotypes resulting from PMP3 deletion. To compare the functions of PutPMP3-1 and PutPMP3-2, the orthologous genes in rice (OsLti6a and OsLti6b) were isolated. Both OsLti6a and OsLti6b could functionally complement the loss of PMP3 in yeast. PutPMP3-2 and OsLti6a were more effective in reversing membrane hyperpolarization than PutPMP3-1 and OsLti6b. However, the four yeast transformants each showed similar levels of salt tolerance. These results imply that these PMP3 family members don't function identically under different stress tolerance conditions.
18589810	[Analysis of rice OsPLD3 and OsPLD4 genes and promoters].	2008	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	Phospholipase Ds (PLDs) exist in many plants. PLDs catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) in cell membrane into phosphatidic acid (PA) and polar free heads (e.g. choline). Two PLD members from rice, OsPLD3 and OsPLD4, were studied by reverse genetics approaches. The results showed that the promoters of OsPLD3 and OsPLD4 could drive the expression of the reporter gene in various tissues of the rice flower organs at different levels. The expression of both genes was induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but with different intensity at different time intervals. No prominent phenotypes were observed by RNA interference with the gene-specific artificial miRNAs or over-expression of the target genes in rice plants, implying the functional redundancy among different members of the rice PLD family.
18544156	A subgroup of plant aquaporins facilitate the bi-directional diffusion of As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 across membranes.	2008	BMC Biol	BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a toxic and highly abundant metalloid that endangers human health through drinking water and the food chain. The most common forms of arsenic in the environment are arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)). As(V) is a non-functional phosphate analog that enters the food chain via plant phosphate transporters. Inside cells, As(V) becomes reduced to As(III) for subsequent extrusion or compartmentation. Although much is known about As(III) transport and handling in microbes and mammals, the transport systems for As(III) have not yet been characterized in plants.

RESULTS: Here we show that the Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Proteins (NIPs) AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 from Oryza sativa, and LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1 from Lotus japonicus are bi-directional As(III) channels. Expression of these NIPs sensitized yeast cells to As(III) and antimonite (Sb(III)), and direct transport assays confirmed their ability to facilitate As(III) transport across cell membranes. On medium containing As(V), expression of the same NIPs improved yeast growth, probably due to increased As(III) efflux. Our data furthermore provide evidence that NIPs can discriminate between highly similar substrates and that they may have differential preferences in the direction of transport. A subgroup of As(III) permeable channels that group together in a phylogenetic tree required N-terminal truncation for functional expression in yeast.

CONCLUSION: This is the first molecular identification of plant As(III) transport systems and we propose that metalloid transport through NIPs is a conserved and ancient feature. Our observations are potentially of great importance for improved remediation and tolerance of plants, and may provide a key to the development of low arsenic crops for food production.
18433929	Chilling stress-induced proteomic changes in rice roots.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Roots are highly sensitive organs in plants. To gain a better knowledge of the chilling stress responses of plants, it is imperative to analyze the tissue-specific proteome patterns under chilling stress. In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry, has been adopted to investigate the protein expression patterns of rice roots in response to chilling stress. Rice seedlings were subjected to 10 degrees C and samples were collected 24 and 72h after treatment. To identify the low-abundant proteins in root tissues, samples were fractionated by 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG), separated by 2-DE, and visualized by silver or CBB staining. A total of 27 up-regulated proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry or electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis. Together with the previously identified cold-stress-responsive proteins, a group of novel proteins were identified including acetyl transferase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase, fructokinase, PrMC3, putative alpha-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein, and glyoxalase 1. These proteins are involved in several cellular processes, including energy production and metabolism, vesicular trafficking, and detoxification. Gene expression at the mRNA level of some selected proteins revealed that transcription levels are not always concomitant to the translational level. Thus, investigation of root proteome expression and identification of some novel proteins could be useful in better understanding the molecular basis of chilling stress responses in plants.
18422887	Spatial and temporal expression of endosperm transfer cell-specific promoters in transgenic rice and barley.	2008	Plant Biotechnol J	Two putative endosperm-specific rice genes, OsPR602 and OsPR9a, were identified from database searches. The promoter regions of these genes were isolated, and transcriptional promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs were stably transformed into rice and barley. The GUS expression patterns revealed that these promoters were active in early grain development in both rice and barley, and showed strongest expression in endosperm transfer cells during the early stages of grain filling. The GUS expression was similar in both rice and barley, but, in barley, expression was exclusively in the endosperm transfer cells and differed in timing of activation relative to rice. In rice, both promoters showed activity not only in the endosperm transfer cells, but also in the transfer cells of maternal tissue and in several floral tissues shortly before pollination. The expression patterns of OsPR602 and OsPR9a in flowers differed. The similarity of expression in both rice and barley suggests that these promoters may be useful to control transgene expression in the transfer cells of cereal grains with the aim of altering nutrient uptake or enhancing the barrier against pathogens at the boundary between maternal tissue and the developing endosperm. However, the expression during floral development should be considered if the promoters are used in rice.
18323646	Purification and characterization of a rice class I chitinase, OsChia1b, produced in Esherichia coli.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	To determine the properties and structure of OsChia1b, a family 19 chitinase from Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (japonica ssp.), recombinant OsChia1b was produced in Esherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity by chitin affinity column chromatography. OsChia1b was highly active against soluble chitinous substrate, but not against crystalline chitin, and clearly inhibited hyphal extension of Trichoderma reesei.
18315698	Abscisic acid regulates gene expression in cortical fiber cells and silica cells of rice shoots.	2008	New Phytol	Drought-induced growth arrest is a major cause of yield loss in crops and is mediated in part by abscisic acid (ABA). The aim of this study was to identify the cell types targeted by ABA during arrest. As transcription factors ABI3 and ABI5 are essential for ABA-induced growth arrest in Arabidopsis, blast was used to identify OsVP1 and OsABF1 as their structural orthologues in rice (Oryza sativa), and employed RNA in situ hybridization to reveal the cell types accumulating the corresponding transcripts in response to ABA. Exogenous ABA arrested the growth of leaves 1, 2 and 3 in young rice shoots and inhibited secondary cell-wall formation in sclerenchyma, including expression of the cellulose synthase gene OsCesA9. Transcripts for OsVP1, OsABF1 and of the putative target genes OsEm, OsLEA3 and WSI18, increased under ABA, accumulating principally in the cytosol of the major support cells (sclerenchymatous cortical fiber cells and epidermal silica cells) of slowly growing leaf 1. Rapidly growing immature tissues in leaves 2 and 3 accumulated OsABF1, OsEm and WSI18 transcripts in the nuclei of all cells, irrespective of ABA treatment. It is concluded that during arrest of leaf growth, ABA targets support cells in maturing tissues. Target cells in immature tissues remain to be identified.
18304453	Characterization of flavone synthase I from rice.	2008	BMB Rep	Flavones are synthesized from flavanones through the action of flavone synthases (FNSs). There are two FNSs, FNS I and II. FNS I is a soluble dioxygenase present in members of the Apiaceae family and FNS II is a membrane bound cytochrome P450 enzyme that has been identified in numerous plant species. In this study, we cloned OsFNS I-1 from rice by RTPCR, expressed it in E. coli, and purified the recombinant protein. By NMR analysis, we found that OsFNS I-1 converted the flavanone (2S)-naringenin into the flavone, apigenin. Moreover, we found that the cofactors oxoglutarate, FeSO(4), ascorbate and catalase are required for this reaction. OsFNS I-1 encodes a flavone synthase I. This is the first type I FNS I found outside of the Apiaceae family.
18283411	Characterization of a histidine- and alanine-rich protein showing interaction with calreticulin in rice.	2009	Amino Acids	Calreticulin (CRT) is a major calcium-sequestering protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions. To analyze the function of CRT in rice, a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assay was used for identifying interacting proteins. Fourteen of 17 interacting cDNA clones found coded for a novel histidine- and alanine-rich protein (OsHARP) of 342 amino acid residues. The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA. Rice plants transformed with the OsHARP promoter-GUS construct showed GUS staining in the basal parts of leaf sheaths, and although GUS activity increased when treated with GA(3), it was not as high an increase as when mRNA was analyzed. To elucidate the role of OsHARP in leaf sheath elongation, antisense OsHARP transgenic rice lines were constructed. The antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were consistently shorter than the vector control under normal conditions. To examine whether OsHARP expression would affect other proteins, basal leaf sheaths from antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomic techniques. In antisense transgenic-rice OsHARP plants, OsCRT was down-regulated and the levels of 20 other proteins were changed compared to the pattern of the vector control. These results signify an important role of HARP in rice leaf sheath cell division or elongation and suggest that CRT may interact with HARP during certain stages of development.
18282189	Cellular distribution of ACT domain repeat protein 9, a nuclear localizing protein, in rice (Oryza sativa).	2008	Physiol Plant	Regulatory ACT domains serve as amino acid-binding sites in certain amino acid metabolic enzymes and transcriptional regulators in bacteria. The ACT domain repeat protein (ACR) family in plants is primarily composed of four copies of the domain homologous to those of the bacteria Gln sensor GLND. In the current study, to evaluate the possible involvement of the protein OsACR9 in the Gln-sensing system related to nitrogen (N) metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.), subcellular localization of OsACR9 and its accumulation and cellular distribution in various rice organs were examined by transient expression analysis and immunological methods using a monospecific antibody, respectively. Transient expression analysis of OsACR9 fused with a synthetic green fluorescent protein in cultured rice cells suggested nuclear localization of OsACR9. In rice roots, OsACR9 protein was distributed in epidermis, exodermis, sclerenchyma and vascular parenchyma cells, and its accumulation markedly increased after supply of NH(+)(4). In rice leaf samples, OsACR9 protein was abundant in the vascular parenchyma and mestome-sheath cells of young leaf blades at the early stage of development and in the vascular parenchyma and phloem-companion cells of mature leaf sheaths. OsACR9 protein also showed a high level of accumulation in vascular parenchyma cells of dorsal vascular bundles and aleurone cells in young rice grains at the early stage of ripening. The possibility of the nuclear protein OsACR9 acting as a Gln sensor in rice is subsequently discussed through comparison of its spatiotemporal expression with that of Gln-responsive N-assimilatory genes.
18266905	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling.	2008	Plant Cell Environ	Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important negative regulator of light-regulated coleoptile elongation in rice. We isolated rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (osjar1) mutants from the Tos17 mutant panel by BLAST search. In far-red and blue lights, osjar1 coleoptiles were longer if compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that OsJar1 participates in the suppression of coleoptile elongation in these light conditions, while the mutant did not show a clear phenotype in red light. The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably. Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling. In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up-regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA). The dose-response curve of the MeJA treatment showed a characteristic pattern: concentrations as low as 4.5 nM could induce OsJar1 transcription, while the gene was superinduced at a concentration of 450 microM MeJA. In summary, this paper demonstrated that OsJar1 modulates light and JA signalling in the photomorphogenesis of rice.
18257679	OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance. Our current study also provides new insight into the roles of OsSGT1 in basal disease resistance.
18256497	Comparison of the enzymatic properties of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins and gibberellins in rice.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The rice genome contains two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes: OsCPS1 acts in gibberellin (phytohormone) biosynthesis, and OsCPS2/OsCyc2 acts in the synthesis of oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E (phytoalexins). We characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant OsCPS2/OsCyc2 fused with a tag-protein at the N-terminus, and compared them to those of OsCPS1. Several enzymatic properties of OsCPS2/OsCyc2, including the optimal pH, optimal temperature, divalent cation requirement, and kinetic values for the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) substrate, were almost the same as those of OsCPS1. However, OsCPS2/OsCyc2 activity was not inhibited by 50-60 muM GGDP substrate, by which the OsCPS1 activity was inhibited. Furthermore, the OsCPS1 activity exhibited approximately 70% inhibition by 100 muM Amo-1618 (a gibberellin biosynthetic inhibitor), whereas the OsCPS2/OsCyc2 activity exhibited approximately 10% inhibition. These results indicate that the properties of OsCPS2/OsCyc2 were partially different from those of OsCPS1, although OsCPS2/OsCyc2 catalyzes the same reaction step as OsCPS1.
18246316	Analysis of the essential DNA region for OsEBP-89 promoter in response to methyl jasmonic acid.	2008	Sci China C Life Sci	In rice, the characterization of OsEBP-89 is inducible by various stress-or hormone-stimuli, including ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonate acid (JA), drought and cold. Here, we report the investigation of essential DNA region within OsEBP-89 promoter for methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) induction. PLACE analysis indicates that this promoter sequence contains multiple potential elements in response to various stimuli. First, we fused this promoter with GUS gene and analyzed its expression under MeJA treatment through Agrobacterium infiltration mediating transient expression in tobacco leaves. Our results revealed that this chimeric gene could be inducible by MeJA in tobacco leaves. To further determine the crucial sequences responsible for MeJA induction, we generated a series of deletion promoters which were fused with GUS reporter gene respectively. The results of transient expression of GUS gene driven by these mutant promoters show that the essential region for MeJA induction is positioned in the region between -1200 and -800 in OsEBP-89 promoter containing a G-box (-1127), which is distinct from the essential region containing ERE (-562) for ACC induction. In all, our finding is helpful in understanding the molecular mechanism of OsEBP-89 expression under different stimuli.
18223202	Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice.	2008	Development	RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions. RFT1 is located only 11.5 kb from Hd3a on chromosome 6. Although RFT1 RNAi plants flowered normally, double RFT1-Hd3a RNAi plants did not flower up to 300 days after sowing (DAS), indicating that Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice. RFT1 expression was very low in wild-type plants, but there was a marked increase in RFT1 expression by 70 DAS in Hd3a RNAi plants, which flowered 90 DAS. H3K9 acetylation around the transcription initiation site of the RFT1 locus had increased by 70 DAS but not at 35 DAS. In the absence of Hd3a and RFT1 expression, transcription of OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, two rice orthologues of Arabidopsis APETALA1, was strongly reduced, suggesting that they act downstream of Hd3a and RFT1. These results indicate that Hd3a and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1 expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification.
18214526	Characterization of substrate specificity of a rice silicon transporter, Lsi1.	2008	Pflugers Arch	Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1) is the first silicon (silicic acid) transporter identified in plant, which belongs to the nodulin 26-like intrinsic membrane protein (NIP) subfamily. In this study, we characterized the function of this transporter by using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. The transport activity of Lsi1 for silicic acid was significantly inhibited by HgCl2 but not by low temperature. Lsi1 also showed an efflux transport activity for silicic acid. The substrate specificity study showed that Lsi1 was able to transport urea and boric acid; however, the transport activity for silicic acid was not affected by the presence of equimolar urea and was decreased only slightly by boric acid. Furthermore, among the NIPs subgroup, OsNIP2;2 showed transport activity for silicic acid, whereas OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;1 did not. We propose that Lsi1 and its close homologues form a unique subgroup of NIP with a distinct ar/R selectivity filter, which is located in the narrowest region on the extra-membrane mouth and govern the substrate specificity of the pore.
18211919	Role of the loop structure of the catalytic domain in rice class I chitinase.	2008	J Biochem	In the three-dimensional structure of a rice class I chitinase (OsChia1b) determined recently, a loop structure (loop II) is located at the end of the substrate-binding cleft, and is thus suggested to be involved in substrate binding. In order to test this assumption, deletion of the loop II region from the catalytic domain of OsChia1b and replacement of Trp159 in loop II with Ala were carried out. The loop II deletion and the W159A mutation increased hydrolytic activity not only towards (GlcNAc)6 but also towards polysaccharide substrates. Similar results were obtained for kcat/Km values determined for substrate reduced-(GlcNAc)5. The two mutations shifted the splitting positions in (GlcNAc)6 to the reducing end side, but the shift was less intensive in the Trp mutant. Theoretical analysis of the reaction time course indicated that sugar residue affinity at the +3 subsite was reduced from -2 kcal/mol to +0.5 kcal/mol by loop II deletion. Reduced affinity at the +3 subsite might enhance the release of product fragments, resulting in higher turnover and higher enzymatic activities. Thus, we concluded that loop II is involved in sugar residue binding at the +3 subsite, but that Trp159 itself appears to contribute only partly to sugar residue interaction at the subsite.
18183401	Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Specific cis-acting elements, identified in the stress-regulated promoters, can respond to the changes in the levels of abscisic acid. Most of our previous works were done with ACGT-containing typical abscisic acid responsive elements (ABREs) but not with non-ACGT, GC-rich sequences also present in such promoters. The current communication shows a comparative analysis performed on the binding of rice nuclear proteins, together with the purified transcription factor OSBZ8, to the cis-elements in the promoters of Rab16A (Motif I/Motif II), Osem (Motif A-1/Motif B) and Em (4X ABRE/2X ABRC). Our data show that the extent of binding of nuclear protein from salt-tolerant rice to both typical ABREs and non-ACGT, ABRE-like sequences such as Motif IIa, is much higher than that from salt-sensitive rice and occurs constitutively, i.e., even with the protein from unstressed plants. The complex formation is low and inducible only by salt in the salt-sensitive variety. While Motif I bind to a single 38 kDa protein, Motif IIa bind to two polypeptides of 38 and 29 kDa. We also show here that the activation and binding of OSBZ8 to the upstream regions of salt-inducible genes depends on its phosphorylated state. The novelty of our work is that it shows rice OSBZ8 as the prime factor interacting with both typical ABRE(s) and ABRE-like sequences. To our knowledge, this is also the first report for the detection and identification of Motif IIa (non-ACGT, coupling element-like)-binding factor(s) from rice and their expression pattern in different rice cultivars.
18071364	Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants.	2008	Cell Res	WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport. These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.
18071256	Identification of a jasmonic acid-responsive region in the promoter of the rice 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 gene OsOPR1.	2007	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The rice 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 gene (OsOPR1), isolated as a jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene, has been suggested to be involved in defense responses in rice. We identified a 19-base pair region that is essential to the JA-responsiveness of OsOPR1 by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay. This region contains possible recognition sites for basic leucine zipper transcription factors.
18057047	Short, direct repeats (SDRs)-mediated post-transcriptional processing of a transcription factor gene OsVP1 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2007	J Exp Bot	The various degrees of preharvest sprouting occurring in hybrid rice is a limiting factor in the propagation and production of hybrid rice seeds. The phenotype of sprouted rice is very similar to that of the maize (Zea mays) seed-specific mutation viviparous 1. VP1 has been shown to be a transcription factor essential for seed maturation and dormancy induction. In this study, numerous truncated transcripts of OsVP1 resulting from an unusual post-transcriptional processing, were detected in four rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars. The observed events took place at a region spanning exons 1 to 5, and led to a variety of deletions that resulted in the loss of functional domain and frame-shifts with premature termination by introducing a stop codon. Various proportions of the transcripts expressed in both immature and mature embryos were observed to be incorrectly processed and associated with the genetic variation of preharvest sprouting rates among various rice varieties. In sprouting-susceptible rice cultivars, G46B and HeiB, many more incorrectly processed OsVP1 transcripts were expressed in immature than in mature embryos, indicating that the unusual post-transcriptional processing of the OsVP1 gene was developmentally regulated. In addition, comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated the presence of paired short direct repeats (SDRs) at the junctions of the unusual excision sites in exons of OsVP1 gene. Site selection for the deletion of exon materials was altered along with the genotypes and developmental stages.
18052121	Metabolite profiling of two low phytic acid (lpa) rice mutants.	2007	J Agric Food Chem	Two low phytic acid (lpa) rice mutant lines, Os-lpa-XS110-1 and Os-lpa-XS110-2, were grown together with their parent wild-type variety Xiushui 110 in four field trials. HPLC analysis of inositol phosphates in the seeds produced demonstrated that compared to the wild-type, the reduction in phytic acid content in Os-lpa-XS110-1 (-46%) was more pronounced than that in Os-lpa-XS110-2 (-23%). Lower inositol phosphates (InsP 3, InsP 4, InsP 5) were not detected in the mutants. The lpa mutants and the wild-type rice were subjected to comparative metabolite profiling by capillary gas chromatography. On average, 34% (Os-lpa-XS110-1) and 42% (Os-lpa-XS110-2) of the detected peaks were statistically significantly different between wild-type and mutants. However, only a few of these differences could be consistently observed for all field trials. Identification and quantification of the consistently different metabolites revealed that contents of myo-inositol and raffinose were increased in Os-lpa-XS110-1 but decreased in Os-lpa-XS110-2 compared to the wild-type. In addition, Os-lpa-XS110-1 exhibited increased levels of galactose and galactinol. Consideration of these metabolic changes in light of the routes involved in the biosynthesis of phytic acid indicated a disturbance in the early biosynthetic pathway of phytic acid in Os-lpa-XS110-2 (similar to the lpa-1 type mutation in maize) and a mutation event affecting phosphorylation of myo-inositol in Os-lpa-XS110-1 (similar to the lpa-3-type mutation).
18037139	Fine mapping and isolation of Bc7(t), allelic to OsCesA4.	2007	J Genet Genomics	Several brittle culm mutants of rice were identified and characterized. In this study, we characterized a brittle mutant (bc7(t)) identified from japonica variety Zhonghua 11 by means of 60Co-gamma radiation. This mutant displays normal phenotype similar to its wild type plants except for the fragility of all plant body, with approximately 10% decrease in the cellulose content. The genetic analysis and gene fine mapping showed that the bc7(t) mutant was controlled by a recessive gene, residing on an 8.4 kb region of the long arm of chromosome 1. The gene annotation indicated that there was only one putative gene encoding cellulose synthase catalytic subunit (CesA) in this region, which was allelic to OsCesA4. Furthermore, the sequence analysis was carried out and 7 bases deletion in the junction of exon 10 and intron 10 was done in bc7(t) mutant, resulting in the change of reading frame and the consequent failure to generate functional protein. In addition, the result of RNA interference experiment showed that when the Bc7(t) was knocked down, the transplants exhibited fragility, similar to bc7(t) mutant. The finding of novel allele of OsCesA4 locus will facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of cell wall biosynthesis. The potential utilization of the bc7(t) mutant in animal food was discussed as well.
17986178	Identification of novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements and their binding proteins in the promoter of OsWRKY13, a gene regulating rice disease resistance.	2008	Plant Cell Environ	The WRKY transcription factor superfamily controls diverse developmental and physiological processes in plants. However, little is known about the factors that directly regulate the function of WRKY genes. In this study, we identified cis-acting elements and their binding proteins of rice OsWRKY13, a gene that plays a pivotal role in disease resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Two novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements, PRE2 and PRE4, were characterized from the promoter region of OsWRKY13. The two cis-elements negatively regulate gene expression without pathogen challenge, and positively regulate gene expression after pathogen-induced protein binding. OsWRKY13 binds to PRE4, which harbours a novel W-like box. Another five proteins (Rad51-like; tubby-like; SWIM zinc finger and nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain R proteins and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domain containing proteins; and an unknown protein) also bind to one of the two cis-elements. Different proteins interacting with the same cis-element appear to have different DNA-binding core sequences. These proteins localize in the nucleus and show differential expression upon pathogen challenge. These results suggest that OsWRKY13 expression is regulated by multiple factors to achieve disease resistance.
17960050	[Preliminary screening of target genes of rice transcription factor OsBP-73].	2007	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	Previous data showed that a 31-bp (from -840 bp to -810 bp) DNA fragment located at the 5' upstream region of rice waxy gene could interact with nuclear protein extracted from developing endosperm of rice. When this 31 bp DNA sequence was used as a bait to screen a rice cDNA library with a yeast one-hybrid system, three groups of cDNA clones were isolated. One of them is pC73, the correspondent rice gene of pC73 was named as OsBP-73 (Oryza sativa binding protein). A pull-down assay was made to identify the target genes of transcription factor by using genomic DNA and recombinant p73 protein. The cDNA fragment containing DNA-binding domain of OsBP-73 was cloned into expression vector pET28-c(+) (Fig.1) to produce protein p73, fused with a his(6)-tag, from E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Fig.2). The p73 was purified with Ni-NTA under native condition (Fig.3). The target genes of p73 were identified in rice genome-wide by using a pull-down assay, and 22 candidate genes were obtained (Figs.4 and 5, and Table 1). The obtained results show that putative light-repressible receptor protein kinase and GAMYB-binding protein could serve as targets of the OsBP-73, suggesting that OsBP-73 might be involved in light signal transduction.
17916638	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl.	2007	J Exp Bot	Reactive oxygen species are thought to play an important role in NaCl stress. Therefore, the expression patterns of the gene family encoding the H(2)O(2)-scavenging enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APx; EC1.11.1.11) were analysed in roots of etiolated rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl stress. Applying semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the mRNA levels were quantified for two cytosolic (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2), two peroxisomal (OsAPx3 and OsAPx4), and four chloroplastic (OsAPx5, OsAPx6, OsAPx7, and OsAPx8) isoforms identified in the rice genome. NaCl at 150 mM and 200 mM increased the expression of OsAPx8 and the activities of APx, but had no effect on the expression of OsAPx1, OsAPx2, OsAPx3, OsAPx4, OsAPx5, OsAPx6, and OsAPx7 in rice roots. However, NaCl at 300 mM up-regulated OsAPx8 expression, increased APx activity, and down-regulated OsAPx7 expression, but had no effect on the expression of OsAPx1, OsAPx2, OsAPx3, OsAPx4, OsAPx5, and OsAPx6. The accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) in response to NaCl was observed in rice roots. Exogenously applied ABA also specifically enhanced the expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots. The accumulation of ABA in rice roots in response to NaCl was inhibited by fluridone (Flu), an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis. Flu treatment also suppressed NaCl-enhanced OsAPx8 expression and APx activity. The effect of Flu on the expression of OsAPx8 and increase in APx activity was reversed by the application of ABA. It appears that NaCl-enhanced expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots is mediated through an accumulation of ABA. Evidence is provided to show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for enhancing OsAPx8 expression, APx activity, and ABA accumulation in rice roots treated with NaCl. H(2)O(2) treatment resulted in an enhancement of OsAPx8 induction but no accumulation of ABA. Diphenylene iodonium treatment, which is known to inhibit NaCl-induced accumulation of H(2)O(2) in rice roots, did not suppress OsAPx8 induction and ABA accumulation by NaCl. It appears that H(2)O(2) is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced OsAPx8 expression in rice roots.
17914176	Expression and molecular characterization of ZmMYB-IF35 and related R2R3-MYB transcription factors.	2007	Mol Biotechnol	R2R3-MYB transcription factors play many important roles in higher plants including the regulation of secondary metabolism, the control of cell shape, and in the response to various stress conditions. In spite of their large number and significance, very few of these genes have been functionally characterized in monocots. Here, we describe the characterization of ZmMYB-IF35 from maize. Using GAL4 fusion constructs, we show that ZmMYB-IF35 possesses the ability to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner and activate transcription in yeast. We also show that ZmMYB-IF35 is capable of binding to the a1 promoter in planta, but it is not sufficient for activation of a1 transcription. Interestingly, a chimeric protein consisting of the MYB domain from ZmMYB-IF35 and the non-MYB C-terminal region of P1, a closely related R2R3-MYB protein, activated transcription from the a1 promoter in planta, suggesting that regions outside the conserved R2R3-MYB domain contribute to regulatory specificity. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that ZmMYB-IF35 expresses primarily in epidermal and vascular cells, while its rice ortholog, OsMYB-IF, displays a broad expression pattern in aerial parts of the plant. Together, our results provide novel insights on the participation of ZmMYB-IF35 and related genes in the regulation of secondary metabolic pathways in the grasses.
17888111	Overexpression of a NAC-domain protein promotes shoot branching in rice.	2007	New Phytol	For a better understanding of shoot branching in rice (Oryza sativa), a rice activation-tagging library was screened for mutations in tiller development. Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype. Flanking sequence was obtained by plasmid rescue. RNA-interfering and overexpression transgenic rice plants were produced using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The mutant phenotype was cosegregated with the reallocation of Ds element, and the flanking region of the reallocated Ds element was identified as part of the OsNAC2 gene. Northern analysis showed that expression of OsNAC2 was greatly induced in the mutant plants. Transgenic rice overexpressing the OsNAC2 resulted in recapture of the mutant phenotype, while downregulation of OsNAC2 in the Ostil1 mutant through RNA interfering (RNAi) complemented the mutant phenotype, confirming that the Ostil1 was caused by overexpression of OsNAC2. Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice. Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation. This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice.
17806099	Precursor-directed biosynthesis of stilbene methyl ethers in Escherichia coli.	2007	Biotechnol J	Stilbenes are bioactive compounds that show beneficial effects for humans, such as anti-tumor activity and survival improvement. Resveratrol, a representative of stilbenes and showing various health-improving activities, is rapidly metabolized in humans, and modified resveratrols are therefore desired as anti-cancer drugs and dietary polyphenols. An Escherichia coli system, in which an artificial stilbene biosynthetic pathway, including steps of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, and stilbene synthase, was reconstructed, produced stilbenes in high yields: resveratrol from tyrosine and pinosylvin from phenylalanine. To incorporate a stilbene methyltransferase gene into this E. coli system, cDNA of Os08g06100 in Oryza sativa was expressed and its O-methylating activity toward stilbenes was confirmed. Incorporation of the pinosylvin methyltransferase (OsPMT) gene into the pathway established in E. coli led to production of mono- and di-methylated stilbenes. Furthermore, the OsPMT gene turned out to be useful in production of unnatural stilbene methyl ethers due to its rather relaxed substrate specificity; various carboxylic acids supplemented as precursors, such as p-fluorocinnamic acid, 3-(2-furyl)acrylic acid, 3-(2-thienyl)acrylic acid, and 3-(3-pyridyl)acrylic acid, to the E. coli system carrying the steps of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, stilbene synthase, and OsPMT were converted to stilbene dimethyl ethers with the corresponding carboxylic moiety.
17764519	superwoman1-cleistogamy, a hopeful allele for gene containment in GM rice.	2007	Plant Biotechnol J	Cleistogamy is an efficient strategy for preventing gene flow from genetically modified (GM) crops. We identified a cleistogamous mutant of rice harbouring a missense mutation (the 45th residue isoleucine to threonine; I45T) in the class-B MADS-box gene SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1), which specifies the identities of lodicules (equivalent to petals) and stamens. In the mutant, spw1-cls, the stamens are normal, but the lodicules are transformed homeotically to lodicule-glume mosaic organs, thereby engendering cleistogamy. Since this mutation does not affect other agronomic traits, it can be used in crosses to produce transgenic lines that do not cause environmental perturbation. Molecular analysis revealed that the reduced heterodimerization ability of SPW1(I45T) with its counterpart class-B proteins OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 caused altered lodicule identity. spw1-cls is the first useful mutant for practical gene containment in GM rice. Cleistogamy is possible in many cereals by engineering class-B floral homeotic genes and thereby inducing lodicule identity changes.
17728297	Involvement of the sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, in the long-distance pathway for assimilate transport in rice.	2007	J Exp Bot	The roles of the rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, have previously been examined in filling grain, germination, and early seedling growth. In the current work, the role that OsSUT1 plays in the transport of assimilate along the entire long-distance pathway, from the flag leaf blade to the base of the filling grain, was investigated. OsSUT1 promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene analysis and immunolocalization revealed that both OsSUT1 promoter::GUS activity and OsSUT protein were present in the mature phloem of all the vegetative tissues involved in the long-distance assimilate transport pathway during grain filling. In addition, expression was observed in the flag leaf blade and sheath prior to heading. The OsSUT1 promoter::GUS activity appeared to be largely confined to the companion cells within the phloem, whereas the protein localized to both the sieve tubes and the companion cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the OsSUT1 transcript is expressed in the uppermost internode of the rice plant (internode-1). These OsSUT localization data were related to measurements of starch and soluble sugar content of these tissues, and localization of the carbohydrate reserves stored in the stem. Results from dye feeding experiments, to examine cellular connections, revealed a symplastic continuity between the phloem and surrounding parenchyma in the flag leaf blade, sheath, and internode-1 tissues. It is proposed that OsSUT1 may primarily play a role in phloem loading of sucrose retrieved from the apoplasm along the transport pathway.
17683575	Expression and functional analysis of TaASY1 during meiosis of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum).	2007	BMC Mol Biol	BACKGROUND: Pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes is required for normal chromosome segregation and the exchange of genetic material via recombination during meiosis. Synapsis is complete at pachytene following the formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). In yeast, HOP1 is essential for formation of the SC, and localises along chromosome axes during prophase I. Homologues in Arabidopsis (AtASY1), Brassica (BoASY1) and rice (OsPAIR2) have been isolated through analysis of mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a similar role to HOP1 in pairing and formation of the SC through localisation to axial/lateral elements of the SC.

RESULTS: The full length wheat cDNA and genomic clone, TaASY1, has been isolated, sequenced and characterised. TaASY1 is located on chromosome Group 5 and the open reading frame displays significant nucleotide sequence identity to OsPAIR2 (84%) and AtASY1 (63%). Transcript and protein analysis showed that expression is largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels during the stages of prophase I when pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur. Immunolocalisation using transmission electron microscopy showed TaASY1 interacts with chromatin that is associated with both axial elements before SC formation as well as lateral elements of formed SCs.

CONCLUSION: TaASY1 is a homologue of ScHOP1, AtASY1 and OsPAIR2 and is the first gene to be isolated from bread wheat that is involved in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes.
17676337	A rice YABBY gene, OsYABBY4, preferentially expresses in developing vascular tissue.	2007	Dev Genes Evol	Developmental gene families have diversified during land plant evolution. The primary role of YABBY gene family is promoting abaxial fate in model eudicot, Arabidopsis thaliana. However recent results suggest that roles of YABBY genes are not conserved in the angiosperms. In this paper, a rice YABBY gene was isolated, and its expression patterns were analyzed in detail. Sequence characterization and phylogenetic analyses showed the gene is OsYABBY4, which is group-classified into FIL/YAB3 subfamily. Beta-glucuronidase reporter assay and in situ analysis consistently revealed that OsYABBY4 was expressed in the meristems and developing vascular tissue of rice, predominantly in the phloem tissue, suggesting that the function of the rice gene is different from those of its counterparts in eudicots. OsYABBY4 may have been recruited to regulate the development of vasculature in rice. However, transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing OsYABBY4 behaved very like those over-expressing FIL or YAB3 with abaxialized lateral organs, suggesting the OsYABBY4 protein domain is conserved with its Arabidopsis counterparts in sequences. Our results also indicate that the functional diversification of OsYABBY4 may be associated with the divergent spatial-temporal expression patterns, and YABBY family members may have preserved different expression regulatory systems and functions during the evolution of different kinds of species.
17674779	[Cloning and bioinformatic analysis of the cDNA encoding a novel heat-shock factor OsHSF13 in Oryza sative L].	2007	Fen Zi Xi Bao Sheng Wu Xue Bao	As a crucial transcription factor family,heat-shock factors were mainly analyzed and characterized in tomato and Arabidposis. In this study, we isolated a putative heat-shock factor OsHSF13 that interacted specifically with heat-shock element (HSE) from Oryza sativa L. by yeast one-hybrid method. The full-length cDNA of OsHSF13 has a 1047bp open reading frame (ORF). It has HSF special DNA-binding domain (DBD) and oligomerization domain (OD). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF13 was a class C heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the sequence and structure of OsHSF13's DNA binding domain had a high similarity with LpHSF24.
17669266	A phi class glutathione S-transferase from Oryza sativa (OsGSTF5): molecular cloning, expression and biochemical characteristics.	2007	J Biochem Mol Biol	A glutathione S-transferase (GST) related to the phi (F) class of enzymes only found in plants has been cloned from the Oryza sativa. The GST cDNA was cloned by PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the OsGSTF5 (GenBank Accession No. AF309382) sequences. The cDNA was composed of a 669-bp open reading frame encoding for 223 amino acids. The deduced peptide of this gene shared on overall identity of 75% with other known phi class GST sequences. On the other hands, the OsGSTF5 sequence showed only 34% identity with the sequence of the OsGSTF3 cloned by our previous study (Cho et al., 2005). This gene was expressed in Escherichia coli with the pET vector system and the gene product was purified to homogeneity by GSH-Sepharose affinity column chromatography. The expressed OsGSTF5 formed a homo-dimer composed of 28 kDa subunit and its pI value was approximately 7.8. The expressed OsGSTF5 displayed glutathione conjugation activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane and glutathione peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide. The OsGSTF5 also had high activities towards the herbicides alachlor, atrazine and metolachlor. The OsGSTF5 was highly sensitive to inhibition by ShexylGSH, benastatin A and hematin. We propose from these results that the expressed OsGSTF5 is a phi class GST and appears to play a role in the conjugation of herbicide and GPOX activity.
17571267	Two rice cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases differentially improve salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2007	Plant Cell Rep	In order to determine the different roles of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (OsAPXa and OsAPXb, GenBank accession nos. D45423 and AB053297, respectively) under salt stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing OsAPXa or OsAPXb were generated, and they all exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress compared to wild-type plants. Moreover, transgenic lines over-expressing OsAPXb showed higher salt tolerance than OsAPXa transgenic lines as indicated by root length and total chlorophyll content. In addition to ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR), which are also involved in the salt tolerance process, and the content of H2O2 were also assayed in both transgenic and wild-type plants. The results showed that the overproduction of OsAPXb enhanced and maintained APX activity to a much higher degree than OsAPXa in transgenic Arabidopsis during treatment with different concentrations of NaCl, enhanced the active oxygen scavenging system, and protected plants from salt stress by equilibrating H2O2 metabolism. Our findings suggest that the rice cytosolic OsAPXb gene has a more functional role than OsAPXa in the improvement of salt tolerance in transgenic plants.
17562689	C-terminal extension of rice glutamate decarboxylase (OsGAD2) functions as an autoinhibitory domain and overexpression of a truncated mutant results in the accumulation of extremely high levels of GABA in plant cells.	2007	J Exp Bot	Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) converts L-glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a non-protein amino acid present in all organisms. Plant GADs carry a C-terminal extension that binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) to modulate enzyme activity. However, rice possesses two distinct types of GAD, OsGAD1 and OsGAD2. Although they both have a C-terminal extension, the former peptide contains an authentic CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), which is common to dicotyledonous plants, while the latter does not. Therefore, the role of the C-terminal extension in functional expression of OsGAD2 was investigated. An in vitro enzyme assay using recombinant OsGAD2 proteins revealed low activity in the presence or absence of Ca(2+)/CaM. However, a truncated version of GAD2 (OsGAD2DeltaC) had over 40-fold higher activity than wild-type GAD at physiological pH. These two DNA constructs were introduced simultaneously into rice calli via Agrobacterium to establish transgenic cell lines. Free amino acids were isolated from several lines for each construct to determine GABA content. Calli overexpressing OsGAD2 and OsGAD2DeltaC had about 6-fold and 100-fold the GABA content of wild-type calli, respectively. Regenerated OsGAD2DeltaC rice plants had aberrant phenotypes such as dwarfism, etiolated leaves, and sterility. These data suggest that the C-terminal extension of OsGAD2 plays a role as a strong autoinhibitory domain, and that truncation of this domain causes the enzyme to act constitutively, with higher activity both in vitro and in vivo.
17562293	Purification and physicochemical characterization of a recombinant phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase from Oryza sativa.	2007	J Biochem Mol Biol	Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) is an unique antioxidant enzyme that directly reduces lipid hydroperoxides in biomembranes. In the present work, the entire encoding region for Oryza sativa PHGPx was expressed in Escherichia coli M15, and the purified fusion protein showed a single band with 21.0 kD and pI = 8.5 on SDS- and IFE-PAGE, respectively. Judging from CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, this protein is considered to have a well-ordered structure with 12.2% alpha-helix, 30.7% beta-sheet, 18.5% gamma-turn, and 38.5% random coil. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme activity were pH 9.3 and 27 degrees C. The enzyme exhibited the highest affinity and catalytical efficiency to phospholipid hydroperoxide employing GSH or Trx as electron donor. Moreover, the protein displayed higher GSH-dependent activity towards t-Butyl-OOH and H(2)O(2). These results show that OsPHGPx is an enzyme with broad specificity for hydroperoxide substrates and yielded significant insight into the physicochemical properties and the dynamics of OsPHGPx.
17562286	Molecular analysis and expression patterns of the 14-3-3 gene family from Oryza sativa.	2007	J Biochem Mol Biol	The ubiquitous family of 14-3-3 proteins functions as regulators in a variety of physiological processes. Eight rice 14-3-3 genes, designated OsGF14a through h, were identified from an exhaustive search of the genome database. Comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences reveal a high degree of identity among members of the OsGF14 family and reported Arabidopsis 14-3-3 proteins. A phylogenetic study indicates that OsGF14s contain both epsilon and non-epsilon forms, which is also confirmed by a structural analysis of OsGF14 genes. Furthermore, transcripts of OsGF14b, OsGF14c, OsGF14d, OsGF14e, OsGF14f and OsGF14g were detected in rice tissues. Their different expression patterns, the different effects of environmental stresses and plant hormones on their transcription levels, and the different complementary phenotypes in yeast 14-3-3 mutants not only indicates that OsGF14s are responsive to various stress conditions and regulated by multiple signaling pathways, but also suggests that functional similarity and diversity coexist among the members of OsGF14 family.
17556805	[Genetic transformation of OSISAP1 gene to onion (Allium cepa L.) mediated by amicroprojectile bombardment].	2007	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	Microprojectile bombardment-mediated transformation method has been developed for onion (Allium cepa L.) using embryogenic calli, induced from stem discs, as target tissue. Zinc-finger protein gene OSISAP1 (Oryza sative subspecies indica stress-associated protein gene) was introduced into the open-pollinated onion cultivar (subs.) 'HG400B'. Bombardment parameters were optimized as: the pressure is 1,100 psi, the distance is 6 cm, two times, the ratio of mass between plasmid DNA and golden particles is 1:320. An efficient microprojectile bombardment-mediated transformation system of onion (Allium cepa L.) callus has been established. The binary vector used carried the nptII gene for kanamycin resistance and the GUS reporter gene. Transgenic cultures were screened for their ability to express the GUS reporter gene and to grow in the presence of kanamycin (150 mg/L). Transient expression of GUS reporter gene was observed through histochemical staining of embryogenic callus transformed by microprojectile bombardment. The putative transgenic plants were analysed at the molecular level using PCR, southern hybridization, and RT-PCR. The results confirmed that the OSISAP1 gene was integrated as one copy into the genome of onion and expression. Transgenic plants were produced efficiently with a transformation frequency of about 10%. Test of salinity-alkali stress showed that sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate at 200 mmol/L effectively killed non-transgenic plants within 1 week of irrigation, while the transgenic plants were completely unaffected by salinity of 400 mmol/L. So transformation with the OSISAP1 gene raised the salinity-alkali-tolerance of the transgenic plants to a high level.
17556768	Decreased panicle-derived indole-3-acetic acid reduces gibberellin A1 level in the uppermost internode, causing panicle enclosure in male sterile rice Zhenshan 97A.	2007	J Exp Bot	Cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) rice Zhenshan 97A (ZS97A) has been widely used in hybrid rice production in China. However, ZS97A suffers from serious panicle enclosure, which blocks normal pollination and greatly reduces seed production of hybrid rice. Little is known about the cause of panicle closure in ZS97A. In this study, it was found that the occurrence of cytoplasmic male sterility caused a deficiency of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in ZS97A panicles, and less IAA was provided to the uppermost internode (UI). Further, it was found that the decreased panicle-derived IAA caused a gibberellin A(1) (GA(1)) deficiency in the UI by the down-regulation of OsGA3ox2 transcript level. Reduced GA(1) level in the UI led to decreases of both cell number and cell elongation, resulting in a shortened UI. The shortened UI was unable to push the panicle out of the flag leaf sheath that remained normal, which resulted in panicle enclosure in ZS97A. These findings suggest that decreased panicle-derived IAA reduces the GA(1) level in the UI, causing panicle enclosure in CMS rice ZS97A.
17545250	The cooperative role of OsCnfU-1A domain I and domain II in the iron sulphur cluster transfer process as revealed by NMR.	2007	J Biochem	OsCnfU-1A is a chloroplast-type Nfu-like protein that consists of tandem repeats sharing high sequence homology. Domain I of this protein, but not domain II, has a C-X-X-C motif that is thought to assemble an iron-sulphur cluster. Herein we report the solution structure of OsCnfU-1A domain I (73-153). Although OsCnfU-1A domain I is structurally similar to OsCnfU-1A domain II (154-226), the electrostatic surface potential of the 2 domains differs. Domain I has an acidic surface, whereas that of domain II is predominantly basic. Chemical shift perturbation studies on OsCnfU-1A domain I and domain II with ferredoxin revealed negligible chemical shift changes in domain I, whereas much larger chemical shift changes were observed in domain II. The residues with larger chemical shift changes were located on the basic surface of domain II. Considering that ferredoxin is predominantly negatively charged, we propose the following hypothesis: First, an iron-sulphur cluster is assembled on domain I. Next, domain II interacts with the ferredoxin, thus tethering domain I close to the ferredoxin. Finally, domain I transfers the iron-sulphur cluster to the ferredoxin. Thus, domain II facilitates the efficient transfer of the iron-sulphur cluster from domain I to the ferredoxin.
17541409	Rice OsHKT2;1 transporter mediates large Na+ influx component into K+-starved roots for growth.	2007	EMBO J	Excessive accumulation of sodium in plants causes toxicity. No mutation that greatly diminishes sodium (Na+) influx into plant roots has been isolated. The OsHKT2;1 (previously named OsHKT1) transporter from rice functions as a relatively Na+-selective transporter in heterologous expression systems, but the in vivo function of OsHKT2;1 remains unknown. Here, we analyzed transposon-insertion rice lines disrupted in OsHKT2;1. Interestingly, three independent oshkt2;1-null alleles exhibited significantly reduced growth compared with wild-type plants under low Na+ and K+ starvation conditions. The mutant alleles accumulated less Na+, but not less K+, in roots and shoots. OsHKT2;1 was mainly expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots. (22)Na+ tracer influx experiments revealed that Na+ influx into oshkt2;1-null roots was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type plants. A rapid repression of OsHKT2;1-mediated Na+ influx and mRNA reduction were found when wild-type plants were exposed to 30 mM NaCl. These analyses demonstrate that Na+ can enhance growth of rice under K+ starvation conditions, and that OsHKT2;1 is the central transporter for nutritional Na+ uptake into K+-starved rice roots.
17536181	Functional validation of a novel isoform of Na+/H+ antiporter from Pennisetum glaucum for enhancing salinity tolerance in rice.	2007	J Biosci	Salt stress is an environmental factor that severely impairs plant growth and productivity. We have cloned a novel isoform of a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter from Pennisetum glaucum (PgNHX1) that contains 5 transmembrane domains in contrast to AtNHX1 and OsNHX1 which have 9 transmembrane domains. Recently we have shown that PgNHX1 could confer high level of salinity tolerance when overexpressed in Brassica juncea. Here,we report the functional validation of this antiporter in crop plant rice. Overexpression of PgNHX1 conferred high level of salinity tolerance in rice. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing PgNHX1 developed more extensive root system and completed their life cycle by setting flowers and seeds in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. Our data demonstrate the potential of PgNHX1 for imparting enhanced salt tolerance capabilities to salt-sensitive crop plants for growing in high saline areas.
17516027	Isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA encoding ERF/AP2-type transcription factor OsAP25 from Oryza sativa L.	2007	Biotechnol Lett	Using a yeast one-hybrid method, a transcription factor, OsAP25, which interacts specifically with a GCC box was isolated from rice. The OsAP25 protein contained a conserved ethylene-responsive element binding factor (ERF) domain which shared identity with other reported ERF domains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsAP25 could be categorized into class III ERF of the previously characterized ERF proteins on an evolutionary relationship. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsAP25 gene was constitutively expressed in leaves, roots, growing points, flower, bolting stage and grain filling stage. In addition, OsAP25 gene was induced by NaCl, cold, drought, abscisic acid and exogenous ethylene.
17486123	OsRRM, a Spen-like rice gene expressed specifically in the endosperm.	2007	Cell Res	We used the promoter trap technique to identify a rice plant, named 107#, in which the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was expressed specifically in the endosperm. A single copy of the T-DNA was inserted into the plant genome, and a candidate gene OsRRM was identified by the insertion. The OsRRM promoter directed GUS expression specifically in rice endosperm, analogous to the GUS expression pattern observed in 107#. OsRRM is a single-copy gene in rice and encodes a nuclear protein containing 1005 amino-acid residues with two RNA recognition motifs and one Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal domain. Western blot analysis confirmed that the OsRRM protein was specifically expressed in rice endosperm. Ectopic expression of OsRRM in transgenic plants led to abnormalities, such as short stature, retarded growth and low fructification rates. Our data, in conjunction with the reported function of Spen genes, implicated OsRRM in the regulation of cell development in rice endosperm.
17485859	Characterization of a set of phytochrome-interacting factor-like bHLH proteins in Oryza sativa.	2007	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The model dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana has a characteristic small sub-family of phytochrome-interacting bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) factors, which are collectively designated the PIL (or PIF) (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE) family proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa). Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned. It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings. When the rice genes (OsPIL11 to OsPIL15) were over-expressed in A. thaliana, the resulting transgenic seedlings displayed anomalous morphologies with very long hypocotyls during early photomorphogenesis. These results suggest the view that the identified OsPILs are functional counterparts (or orthologs) of AtPILs, which are known to play important roles in red light-mediated (phyA and/or phyB-dependent) signal transduction pathways at immediate positions downstream of the photoreceptor in A. thaliana.
17470145	RNAi knockdown of Oryza sativa root meander curling gene led to altered root development and coiling which were mediated by jasmonic acid signalling in rice.	2007	Plant Cell Environ	Jasmonic acid (JA) is a well-known defence hormone, but its biological function and mechanism in rice root development are less understood. Here, we describe a JA-induced putative receptor-like protein (OsRLK, AAL87185) functioning in root development in rice. RNA in situ hybridization revealed that the gene was expressed largely in roots, and a fusion protein showed its localization on the plasma membrane. The primary roots in RNAi transgenic rice plants meandered and curled more easily than wild-type (WT) roots under JA treatment. Thus, this gene was renamed Oryza sativa root meander curling (OsRMC). The transgenic primary roots were shorter, the number of adventitious roots increased and the number of lateral roots decreased as compared to the WT. As well, the second sheath was reduced in length. Growth of both primary roots and second sheaths was sensitive to JA treatment. No significant change of JA level appeared in the roots between the transgenic rice line and WT. Expression of RSOsPR10, involved in the JA signalling pathway, was induced in transgenic rice. Western blotting revealed OsRMC induced by JA. Our results suggest that OsRMC of the DUF26 subfamily involved in JA signal transduction mediates root development and negatively regulates root curling in rice.
17464219	Identification of putative MAPK kinases in Oryza minuta and O. sativa responsive to biotic stresses.	2007	Mol Cells	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is critical for regulating plant defense systems against various kinds of pathogen and environmental stresses. One component of this cascade, the MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), has not yet been shown to be induced in plants following biotic attacks, such as those by insects and fungi. We describe here a gene coding for a blast (Magnaporthe grisea)- and insect (Nilaparvata lugens)-responsive putative MAPK kinase, OmMKK1 (Oryza minuta MAPKK 1), which was identified in a library of O. minuta expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two copies of OmMKK1 are present in the O. minuta genome. They encode a predicted protein with molecular mass 39 kDa and pI of 6.2. Transcript patterns following imbibition of plant hormones such as methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA), ethephone, salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA), as well as exposure to methyl viologen (MV), revealed that the expression of OmMKK1 is related to defense response signaling pathways. A comparative analysis of OmMKK1 and its O. sativa ortholog OsMKK1 showed that both were induced by stress-related hormones and biotic stresses, but that the kinetics of their responses differed despite their high amino acid sequence identity (96%).
17464198	Comprehensive analysis of the expression of twenty-seven beta-1, 3-glucanase genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Mol Cells	Plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. Very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. In this study, we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1, 3-glucanases (OsGlu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. The OsGlu genes were obtained by PCR from a cDNA library and were classified into seven groups (Group I to VII) according to their DNA or amino acid sequence homology. Analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven OsGlu genes by Northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as well as in response to plant hormones, biotic stress, high salt etc. OsGlu11 and 27 in Group IV were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by SA (5 mM), ABA (200 microM), and M. grisea. OsGlu1, 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible M. grisea interaction than in compatible one. Taken together, our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice OsGlu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development.
17464192	Molecular and functional characterization of monocot-specific Pex5p splicing variants, using OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS from rice (Oryza sativa).	2007	Mol Cells	We identified two alternatively spliced variants of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) receptor protein Pex5ps in monocot (rice, wheat, and barley) but not in dicot (Arabidopsis and tobacco) plants. We characterized the molecular and functional differences between the rice (Oryza sativa) Pex5 splicing variants OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS. There is only a single-copy of OsPEX5 in the rice genome and RT-PCR analysis points to alternative splicing of the transcripts. Putative light-responsive cis-elements were identified in the 5' region flanking OsPEX5L and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that this region affected light-dependent expression of OsPEX5 transcription. Using the pex5-deficient yeast mutant Scpex5, we showed that OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS are able to restore translocation of a model PTS1 protein (GFP-SKL) into peroxisomes. OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS formed homo-complexes via specific interaction domains, and interacted with each other and OsPex14p to form hetero-complexes. Although overexpression of OsPex5pL in the Arabidopsis pex5 mutant (Atpex5) rescued the mutant phenotype, overexpression of OsPex5pS only resulted in partial recovery.
17452999	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination.	2007	Cell Res	Previous studies have demonstrated the possible role of several aquaporins in seed germination. But systematic investigation of the role of aquaporin family members in this process is lacking. Here, the developmental regulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) expression throughout germination and post-germination processes in rice embryos was analyzed. The expression patterns of the PIPs suggest these aquaporins play different roles in seed germination and seedling growth. Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions. Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination. Our data also revealed that the nitric oxide (NO) donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), promoted seed germination; furthermore, the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, inhibited germination and reduced the stimulative effects of SNP and GSNO on rice germination. Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds. These results suggest that water channels play an important role in seed germination, acting, at least partly, in response to the NO signaling pathway.
17447911	A class I KNOX gene from the palm species Elaeis guineensis (Arecaceae) is associated with meristem function and a distinct mode of leaf dissection.	2007	New Phytol	Class I Knotted-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors are important regulators of shoot apical meristem function and leaf morphology by their contribution to dissected leaf development. Palms are of particular interest as they produce dissected leaves generated by a distinct mechanism compared with eudicots. The question addressed here was whether class I KNOX genes might be involved in meristem function and leaf dissection in palms. Here, we characterized the EgKNOX1 gene from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis, Arecaceae) and compared it with available sequences from other plant species using phylogenetic analysis. Gene expression pattern was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Functional analysis was carried out by ectopic expression in Arabidopsis and rice. EgKNOX1 was orthologous to STM from Arabidopsis and to OSH1 from rice. It was expressed in the central zone of both vegetative and reproductive meristems. During leaf development, its expression was associated with plications from which the leaflets originate. Different modes of leaf dissection are seen to involve a similar class of genes to control meristematic activities, which govern the production of dissected morphologies.
17431550	The NMR structure of the domain II of a chloroplastic NifU-like protein OsNifU1A.	2007	J Biomol NMR	NifU-like proteins are a highly conserved protein that serves as the scaffold for assembly of Fe-S clusters. Chloroplastic NifU-like proteins have tandem NifU like domains, named domain I and domain II. Although the amino acid sequences of these domains are very similar to each other, the predicted functional region for the Fe-S cluster assembly, the CXXC motif, exists only in domain I. The structure of the domain II of chloroplastic NifU-like protein OsNifU1A has an alpha-beta sandwich structure containing two alpha helices located on one side of the beta-sheet. The electrostatic surface potential of OsNifU1A domain II is predominantly positively charged. Chloroplastic NifU-like proteins are targeted to ferredoxin for transferring the Fe-S cluster. The ferredoxin presents an overall negatively charged surface, which may evoke an electrostatic association with OsNifU1A domain II.
17253710	Chemically induced expression of rice OSB2 under the control of the OsPR1.1 promoter confers increased anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic rice.	2007	J Agric Food Chem	Anthocyanin pigmentation provides an excellent system with which to study the regulation of gene expression in higher plants. In this study, OsPR1.1 promoter was isolated and the promoter activity was monitored using a reporter gene OSB2, which encodes a transcription factor for anthocyanin synthesis in rice plants. We introduced PR::OSB2 plasmid into an isogenic Taichung 65, no. 99-962 T-65 CBA B9F5 (T65 CBA), rice line (Oryza sativa L.) and found that the transgenic rice plants exhibited anthocyanin accumulation by the induced expression of OSB2 after chemical treatments with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (DCINA). The shoots of the PR::OSB2 transgenic rice plants changed color to red after application of the chemicals accompanying with the increased anthocyanin content to approximately 5-fold by MeJA and 2-fold by DCINA, respectively. The anthocyanin accumulation was consistent with the increase of the expression of OSB2 and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS). This color change system could provide a useful and easy way to produce transgenic plants for monitoring of chemicals in the environment.
17219102	Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Plant Cell Rep	During their reproductive stage, rice crops often are exposed to cold stress, which leads to sterility and reduced yields. To understand the cold response mechanism at that stage, we used an mRNA differential display method to isolate cold-responsive genes from pre-anthesis flowers. Approximately 5,000 transcripts were identified here, of which 123 were found to be displayed differentially between the control (30 degrees C) and cold-treated (12 degrees C) flowers. Among them, 26 were analyzed by northern analysis; 8 of those clones were confirmed as cold-responsive. OsLti6b, encoding a hydrophobic protein homologous to Arabidopsis RCI2, was analyzed in detail. RNA blot analysis revealed that its transcript is increased by cold, salt, drought, or ABA treatments. In situ hybridization indicated that this transcript is highly accumulated in the ovaries and stamens of cold-treated flowers, particularly in the anther walls and vascular tissues of the filaments. Over-expression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level.
17172048	Adapting rice anther culture to gene transformation and RNA interference.	2006	Sci China C Life Sci	Anther culture offers a rapid method of generating homozygous lines for breeding program and genetic analysis. To produce homozygous transgenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in one step, we developed an efficient protocol of anther-callus-based transformation mediated by Agrobacterium after optimizing several factors influencing efficient transformation, including callus induction and Agrobacterium density for co-cultivation. Using this protocol, we obtained 145 independent green transformants from five cultivars of japonica rice by transformation with a binary vector pCXK1301 bearing the rice gene, Xa21 for resistance to bacterial blight, of which 140 were further confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization analysis, including haploids (32.1%), diploids (62.1%) and mixoploids (7.5%). Fifteen diploids were found to be doubled haploids, which accounted for 10.7% of the total positive lines. Finally, by including 28 from colchicine induced or spontaneous diploidization of haploids later after transformation, a total of 43 doubled haploids (30.7%) of Xa21 transgenic lines were obtained. We also generated two RNAi transgenic haploids of the rice OsMADS2 gene, a putative redundant gene of OsMADS4 based on their sequence similarity, to investigate its possible roles in rice flower development by this method. Flowers from the two OsMADS2 RNAi transgenic haploids displayed obvious homeotic alternations, in which lodicules were transformed into palea/lemma-like tissues, whereas identities of other floral organs were maintained. The phenotypic alternations were proved to result from specific transcriptional suppression of OsMADS2 gene by the introduced RNAi transgene. The results confirmed that OsMADS2 is involved in lodicule development of rice flower and functionally redundant with OsMADS4 gene. Our results demonstrated that rice anther culture could be adapted to gene transformation and RNAi analysis in rice.
17172047	Cloning, expression and function of phosphate transporter encoded gene in Oryza sativa L.	2006	Sci China C Life Sci	OsPT6:1, a phosphate transporter encoding gene from the leaf samples of Oryza sativa, was identified through PCR with specifically designed primers. The phylogenetic analysis and the conserved amino acid residue site detection suggested OsPT6:1 a possible high-affinity phosphate transporter encoding gene. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR demonstrated the expression of OsPT6:1 in both roots and leaves. The peak expression signal was observed in mesophyll cells under low phosphorus (P) induction. A homologous recombination study indicated that OsPT6:1 can enhance the Pi uptake efficiency of Pichia pastoris. At the meantime, the introduction of OsPT6:1 was able to complement the Pi uptake function of yeast cells with high-affinity phosphate transporters deficient. Those results substantiated our contention that OsPT6:1 encoded a high-affinity phosphate transporter of Oryza sativa.
17091197	Functional characterization of a putative nitrate transporter gene promoter from rice.	2006	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Drought is one of the most significant abiotic stresses that influence plant growth and development. Expression analysis revealed that OsNRT1.3, a putative nitrate transporter gene in rice, was induced by drought. To confirm if the OsNRT1.3 promoter can respond to drought stress, a 2019 bp upstream sequence of OsNRT1.3 was cloned. Three OsNRT1.3 promoter fragments were generated by 5'-deletion, and fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into rice plants. NRT2019::GUS, NRT1196::GUS and NRT719::GUS showed similar expression patterns in seeds, roots, leaves and flowers in all transgenic rice, and GUS activity conferred by different OsNRT1.3 promoter fragments was significantly upregulated by drought stress, indicating that OsNRT1.3 promoter responds to drought stress and the 719 bp upstream sequence of OsNRT1.3 contains the drought response elements.
17080612	gid1, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack.	2006	Plant Cell Environ	A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (gid1), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA. To elucidate the function of gid1, proteins regulated downstream of gid1 were analysed using a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from suspension-cultured cells of gid1 and its wild type were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Of a total of 962 proteins identified from the suspension-cultured cells, 16 were increased and 14 were decreased in gid1 compared with its wild type. Among the proteins hyper-accumulated in gid1 were osmotin, triosephosphate isomerase, probenazole inducible protein (PBZ1) and pathogenesis-related protein 10. Of these four genes, only the expression of PBZ1 was increased by exogenous GA3 application. Expression of this gene was also enhanced in shoots of the wild type by cold stress or by rice blast fungus infection. Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in gid1 than in the wild type. In addition, gid1 showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection. The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in gid1 relative to the wild type. Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in gid1. These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that gid1 is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
17016673	Expression of a carbonic anhydrase gene is induced by environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Biotechnol Lett	Expression of the gene (OsCA1) coding for carbonic anhydrase (CA) in leaves and roots of rice was induced by environmental stresses from salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), and osmotic stress (10%, w/v, PEG 6000). CA activity of rice seedlings more than doubled under some of these stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing OsCA1 had a greater salt tolerance at the seedling stage than wild-type plants in 1/2 MS medium with 5 mM NaHCO(3), 50 mM NaCl, on 100 mM NaCl. Thus CA expression responds to environmental stresses and is related to stress tolerance in rice.
16957091	Rice chitinases: sugar recognition specificities of the individual subsites.	2006	Glycobiology	Sugar recognition specificities of class III (OsChib1a) and class I (OsChia1cDeltaChBD) chitinases from rice, Oryza sativa L., were investigated by analyzing (1)H- and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the enzymatic products from partially N-acetylated chitosans. The reducing end residue of the enzymatic products obtained by the class III enzyme was found to be exclusively acetylated, whereas both acetylated and deacetylated units were found at the nearest neighbor to the reducing end residue. Both acetylated and deacetylated units were also found at the nonreducing end residue and its nearest neighbor of the class III enzyme products. Thus, only subsite (-1) among the contiguous subsites (-2) to (+2) of the class III enzyme was found to be specific to an acetylated residue. For the class I enzyme, the reducing end residue was preferentially acetylated, although the specificity was not absolute. The nearest neighbor to the acetylated reducing end residue was specifically acetylated. Moreover, the nonreducing end residue produced by the class I enzyme was exclusively acetylated, although there was a low but significant preference for deacetylated units at the nearest neighbor to the nonreducing end. These results suggest that the three contiguous subsites (-2), (-1), and (+1) of the class I enzyme are specific to three consecutive GlcNAc residues of the substrate. In rice plants, the target of the class I enzyme might be a consecutive GlcNAc sequence probably in the cell wall of fungal pathogen, whereas the class III enzyme might act toward an endogenous complex carbohydrate containing GlcNAc residue.
16875320	Isolation and identification of SA and JA inducible protein kinase gene OsSJMK1 in rice.	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	On the basis of a JA-inducible EST, the full length cDNA of a putative protein kinase gene, OsSJMKJ, was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The predicted protein of this gene, consisting of 498 amino acids with a predicted PI value of 8.43, contains a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) domain with a dual-phosphorylation activation motif TDY (Thr-Asp-Tyr) and a C-terminus domain that feature a typical MAPK belonging to subgroup V. OsSJMK1 showed 81% sequence identity to the reported BWMK1, a blast fungus and wounding inducible protein, in the N-terminus kinase domain but had low sequence identity in the C-terminus domain. Despite the high similarity of gene structure between OsSJMK1 and BWMK1, the expression of OsSJMK1 was weakly induced by blast fungus but not wounding, rather it was transiently induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) at early stages of treatment. This gene was not induced by other hormones (such as ABA) or abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity. The low level of transcript of this gene was detected in the various tissues of rice. The results suggest that OsSJMK1 might be activated specifically by JA and SA and involved in defense signaling pathways.
16807830	New insights into the biology of cytokinin degradation.	2006	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	A survey of recent results is presented concerning the role of cytokinin degradation in plants, which is catalyzed by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzymes. An overview of Arabidopsis CKX gene expression suggests that their differential regulation by biotic and abiotic factors contributes significantly to functional specification. Here, we show using reporter gene and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses regulation of individual CKX genes by cytokinin, auxin, ABA, and phosphate starvation. Partially overlapping expression domains of CKX genes and cytokinin-synthesizing IPT genes in meristematic tissues and endo-reduplicating cells lend support for a locally restricted function of cytokinin. On the other hand, their expression in vascular tissue suggests a function in controlling transported cytokinin. Recent studies led to a model for the biochemical reaction mechanism of CKX-mediated catalysis, which was refined on the basis of the three-dimensional enzyme structure. Last but not least, the developmental functions of CKX enzymes are addressed. The recent identification of the rice OSCKX2 gene as an important novel breeding tool is highlighted. Together the results corroborate the relevance of metabolic control in determining cytokinin activity.
16807829	Noise yields order--auxin, actin, and polar patterning.	2006	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Plant patterns have to integrate environmental cues and to cope with a high level of noise in the sensory outputs of individual cells. In the first part of this review, we demonstrate that local self-amplification linked to lateral inhibition can meet this requirement. In the second part, we describe the search for candidates for such self-amplification loops in the context of auxin-dependent cell growth using Graminean coleoptiles as a model. Auxin-dependent reorganization of actin microfilaments interfered with the auxin sensitivity of growth. Auxin might control the intracellular transport of factors important for auxin sensing via the actomyosin system. By means of a rice mutant with elevated auxin responsiveness, we identified an auxin response factor (OSARF1), whose expression is upregulated by auxin as a second candidate for a self-amplification loop. We studied the cross-talk between auxin signalling and environmental cues in the rice mutant hebiba, where the photoinhibition of growth is impaired. We found that jasmonate plays a central role in this cross-talk correlated to a downregulation of auxin responsiveness. To obtain an insight into auxin-dependent coordination, we analyzed a tobacco cell line with axial cell divisions. By a combination of modelling and physiological manipulation, we could demonstrate that auxin synchronizes the divisions of adjacent cells on the background of strong heterogeneity of individual cells. We conclude that self-amplification of auxin signalling coupled to mutual competition for available auxin provides a versatile tool to fulfill the special requirements posed by patterning in plants.
16775631	Water relations and an expression analysis of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins in sensitive and tolerant rice during chilling and recovery.	2006	Cell Res	A symptom of chilling injury is development of water deficit in shoots, resulting from an imbalance of water transport and transpiration. In this work, two rice varieties (Oryza sativa L. var. Wasetoitsu and Somewake) seedlings were chilled at 7 degrees C, followed by recovery at 28 degrees C. Based on the growth phenotype and electrolyte leakage tests, Somewake was shown to be a chilling-tolerant variety, and Wasetoitsu a chilling-sensitive one. The chilling stress reduced markedly the relative water content (RWC) of leaves, accumulative transpiration and osmotic root hydraulic conductivity (Lp) in both varieties. But when returned to 28 degrees C, the water relation balance of Somewake recovered better. The mRNA expression profile of all the 11 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), a subgroup of aquaporins, was subsequently determined by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with TaqMan-minor grove binder (MGB) probes derived from rice var. Nipponbare during chilling treatment and recovery. Most of the PIP genes was down-regulated at the low temperature, and recovered at the warm temperature. The relative expression of some PIPs in both Somewake and Wasetoitsu decreased in parallel during the chilling. However during the recovery, the relative expression of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;7 in shoots and OsPIP1;1, OsPIP2;1 in roots were significantly higher in Somewake than Wasetoitsu. This supports the role of PIPs in re-establishing water balance after chilling conditions. We discuss the diversified roles played by members of the aquaporin PIP subfamily in plant chilling tolerance depending on aquaporin isoforms, plant tissue and the stage of chilling duration.
16773042	Upland rice and lowland rice exhibited different PIP expression under water deficit and ABA treatment.	2006	Cell Res	Aquaporins play a significant role in plant water relations. To further understand the aquaporin function in plants under water stress, the expression of a subgroup of aquaporins, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), was studied at both the protein and mRNA level in upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhonghan 3) and lowland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Xiushui 63) when they were water stressed by treatment with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Plants responded differently to 20% PEG treatment. Leaf water content of upland rice leaves was reduced rapidly. PIP protein level increased markedly in roots of both types, but only in leaves of upland rice after 10 h of PEG treatment. At the mRNA level, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1 and OsPIP2;5 in roots as well as OsPIP1;2 and OsPIP1;3 in leaves were significantly up-regulated in upland rice, whereas the corresponding genes remained unchanged or down-regulated in lowland rice. Meanwhile, we observed a significant increase in the endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level in upland rice but not in lowland rice under water deficit. Treatment with 60 microM ABA enhanced the expression of OsPIP1;2, OsPIP2;5 and OsPIP2;6 in roots and OsPIP1;2, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;6 in leaves of upland rice. The responsiveness of PIP genes to water stress and ABA were different, implying that the regulation of PIP genes involves both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathways during water deficit.
16761097	Rice GTPase OsRacB: potential accessory factor in plant salt-stress signaling.	2006	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	As the sole ubiquitous signal small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein in plants, Rop gene plays an important role in plant growth and development. In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance. Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment. Promoter analysis showed that OsRacB promoter is induced by salinity and exogenous salicylic acid, not abscisic acid. To elucidate its physiological function, we generated OsRacB sense and antisense transgenic tobacco and rice. Under proper salinity treatment, sense transgenic plants grew much better than the control. This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance. But under the same treatment, no difference could be observed between OsRacB antisense plants and the control. The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance.
16730464	Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice.	2006	Cell Biol Int	Chilling during male gametophyte development in rice inhibits development of microspores, causing male sterility. Changes in cellular ultrastructure that have been exposed to mild chilling include microspores with poor pollen wall formation, abnormal vacuolation and hypertrophy of the tapetum and unusual starch accumulation in the plastids of the endothecium in post-meiotic anthers. Anthers observed during tetrad release also have callose (1,3-beta-glucan) wall abnormalities as shown by immunocytochemical labelling. Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment. Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation. Premature callose breakdown apparently restricts the basic framework of the future pollen wall. Vacuolation and hypertrophy are also symptoms of osmotic imbalance triggered by the reabsorption of callose breakdown products due to absence of OsMST8 activity.
16704112	Alterations in DNA methylation and genome structure in two rice mutant lines induced by high pressure.	2006	Sci China C Life Sci	By using high-pressure treatment, two mutant lines were obtained from a genetically stable japonica rice cultivar Bijing38. Genomic DNA of the mutant lines, together with the original line (Bijing38), was either undigested or digested by Hpa IIMsp I, and then subjected to molecular analysis using two markers, ISSR and RAPD. Results indicated that changes in the PCR amplification profiles of both markers are apparent in the two mutant lines compared with the original rice cultivar, suggesting that there had been both sequence changes and DNA methylation modifications in the mutant lines. Southern blot analysis using diverse sequences, including two cellular genes (S2 and S3), a set of retrotransposons (Osr7, Osr36, Tos19 and more), and a MITE transposon family (mPing and Pong), confirmed the results, and indicated that changes in DNA methylation pattern, genomic structure, and possible activation of some transposons indeed occurred in the mutant lines. Moreover, these changes are stably maintained through selfed generations and in different organs. Thus, our results indicate that it is possible to obtain stable mutants in rice by high pressure treatments, and the molecular basis of the mutants may include both genetic and epigenetic changes. Therefore, high hydrostatic pressure seems a promising approach for plant mutagenesis.
16699542	MORN motifs in plant PIPKs are involved in the regulation of subcellular localization and phospholipid binding.	2006	Cell Res	Multiple repeats of membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs were detected in plant phosphatidylinositl monophosphate kinase (PIPK), a key enzyme in PI-signaling pathway. Structural analysis indicates that all the MORN motifs (with varied numbers at ranges of 7-9), which shared high homologies to those of animal ones, were located at N-terminus and sequentially arranged, except those of OsPIPK1 and AtPIPK7, in which the last MORN motif was separated others by an approximately 100 amino-acid "island" region, revealing the presence of two kinds of MORN arrangements in plant PIPKs. Through employing a yeast-based SMET (sequence of membrane-targeting) system, the MORN motifs were shown being able to target the fusion proteins to cell plasma membrane, which were further confirmed by expression of fused MORN-GFP proteins. Further detailed analysis via deletion studies indicated the MORN motifs in OsPIPK1, together with the 104 amino-acid "island" region are involved in the regulation of differential subcellular localization, i.e. plasma membrane or nucleus, of the fused proteins. Fat Western blot analysis of the recombinant MORN polypeptide, expressed in Escherichia coli, showed that MORN motifs could strongly bind to PA and relatively slightly to PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. These results provide informative hints on mechanisms of subcellular localization, as well as regulation of substrate binding, of plant PIPKs.
16689935	DNA strand exchange activity of rice recombinase OsDmc1 monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the role of ATP hydrolysis.	2006	FEBS J	Rad51 and disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (Dmc1) are the two eukaryotic DNA recombinases that participate in homology search and strand exchange reactions during homologous recombination mediated DNA repair. Rad51 expresses in both mitotic and meiotic tissues whereas Dmc1 is confined to meiosis. DNA binding and pairing activities of Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (OsDmc1) from rice have been reported earlier. In the present study, DNA renaturation and strand exchange activities of OsDmc1 have been studied, in real time and without the steps of deproteinization, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The extent as well as the rate of renaturation is the highest in conditions that contain ATP, but significantly less when ATP is replaced by slowly hydrolysable analogues of ATP, namely adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP) or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio triphosphate) (ATP-gamma-S), where the former was substantially poorer than the latter in facilitating the renaturation function. FRET assay results also revealed OsDmc1 protein concentration dependent strand exchange function, where the activity was the fastest in the presence of ATP, whereas in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor it was several fold ( approximately 15-fold) slower. Interestingly, strand exchange, in reactions where ATP was replaced with AMP-PNP or ATP-gamma-S, was somewhat slower than that of even minus nucleotide cofactor control. Notwithstanding the slow rates, the reactions with no nucleotide cofactor or with ATP-analogues did reach the same steady state level as seen in ATP reaction. FRET changes were unaffected by the steps of deproteinization following OsDmc1 reaction, suggesting that the assay results reflected stable events involving exchanges of homologous DNA strands. All these results, put together, suggest that OsDmc1 catalyses homologous renaturation as well as strand exchange events where ATP hydrolysis seems to critically decide the rates of the reaction system. These studies open up new facets of a plant recombinase function in relation to the role of ATP hydrolysis.
16639503	Differential expression of two fructokinases in Oryza sativa seedlings grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.	2006	J Plant Res	Fructokinases (EC 2.7.1.4) may play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism of Oryza sativa L. (rice) seedlings under anoxia. We present here the molecular and biochemical characterizations of two rice fructokinases, namely OsFK1 and OsFK2. The results show that, at both a transcriptional and a transductional level, OsFK1 is preferentially expressed under aerobic conditions, whereas OsFK2 is induced under anoxia. Substrate inhibition was demonstrated for OsFK1, while OsFK2 appears to be largely unaffected by fructose concentrations up to 10 mM. Sugar modulation of anoxia-induced proteins has been proposed, but our results on rice calli treated with or without glucose (10, 30 or 90 mM) for different time indicate that neither OsFK1 nor OsFK2 are sugar-regulated. We propose that OsFK2 plays a major role in fructose phosphorylation under anoxic conditions.
16556979	Expression analysis of genes for callose synthases and Rho-type small GTP-binding proteins that are related to callose synthesis in rice anther.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The most chilling-sensitive stage of rice has been found to be at the onset of microspore release. The microsporocytes produce a wall of callose between the primary cell wall and the plasma membrane, and it has been shown that precise regulation of callose synthesis and degradation in anther is essential for fertile pollen formation. In this study, genes for 10 callose synthases in the rice genome were fully annotated and phylogenetically analyzed. Expression analysis of these genes showed that OsGSL5, an ortholog of microsporogenesis-related AtGSL2, was specifically expressed in anthers, and was notably downregulated by cooling treatment. Gene expression profiles of Rho-type small GTP-binding proteins in rice anther were also analyzed. The mechanisms of callose synthesis in rice pollen formation and its relationships with cool tolerance are discussed.
16548068	Proteomic analyses of Oryza sativa mature pollen reveal novel proteins associated with pollen germination and tube growth.	2006	Proteomics	As a highly reduced organism, pollen performs specialized functions to generate and carry sperm into the ovule by its polarily growing pollen tube. Yet the molecular genetic basis of these functions is poorly understood. Here, we identified 322 unique proteins, most of which were not reported previously to be in pollen, from mature pollen of Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica using a proteomic approach, 23% of them having more than one isoform. Functional classification reveals that an overrepresentation of the proteins was related to signal transduction (10%), wall remodeling and metabolism (11%), and protein synthesis, assembly and degradation (14%), as well as carbohydrate and energy metabolism (25%). Further, 11% of the identified proteins are functionally unknown and do not contain any conserved domain associated with known activities. These analyses also identified 5 novel proteins by de novo sequencing and revealed several important proteins, mainly involved in signal transduction (such as protein kinases, receptor kinase-interacting proteins, guanosine 5'-diphosphate dissociation inhibitors, C2 domain-containing proteins, cyclophilins), protein synthesis, assembly and degradation (such as prohibitin, mitochondrial processing peptidase, putative UFD1, AAA+ ATPase), and wall remodeling and metabolism (such as reversibly glycosylated polypeptides, cellulose synthase-like OsCsLF7). The study is the first close investigation, to our knowledge, of protein complement in mature pollen, and presents useful molecular information at the protein level to further understand the mechanisms underlying pollen germination and tube growth.
16541126	Expression and functional analysis of the rice plasma-membrane intrinsic protein gene family.	2006	Cell Res	Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) are a subfamily of aquaporins that enable fast and controlled translocation of water across the membrane. In this study, we systematically identified and cloned ten PIP genes from rice. Based on the similarity of the amino acid sequences they encoded, these rice PIP genes were classified into two groups and designated as OsPIP1-1 to OsPIP1-3 and OsPIP2-1 to OsPIP2-7 following the nomenclature of PIP genes in maize. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis identified three root-specific and one leaf-specific OsPIP genes. Furthermore, the expression profile of each OsPIP gene in response to salt, drought and ABA treatment was examined in detail. Analysis on transgenic plants over-expressing of either OsPIP1 (OsPIP1-1) or OsPIP2 (OsPIP2-2) in wild-type Arabidopsis, showed enhanced tolerance to salt (100 mM of NaCl) and drought (200 mM of mannitol), but not to salt treatment of higher concentration (150 mM of NaCl). Taken together, these data suggest a distinct role of each OsPIP gene in response to different stresses, and should add a new layer to the understanding of the physiological function of rice PIP genes.
16477129	[A preliminary analysis of the function of the OsRab5a gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)].	2006	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	OsRab5a encodes a Rab5 protein in rice, which belongs to the Rab family of small GTP-binding protein superfamily. Transgenic plants with POsrab5a::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene indicate that OsRab5a is expressed in callus, root, stem, leaf, root base and spikelet (Figs.1, 2H-1). Using the transgenic Arabidopsis with fused gene of GFP::OsRab5a and GFP::OsRab5aCA and by using FM4-64 (the lipophilic styryl dye) staining, we have demonstrated that OsRab5a is involved in vesicular transport and GFP-OsRab5a is localized on the plasma membrane and early endosomes (Fig.2A-C), while GFP-OsRab5aCA is localized in the cell membrane (Fig.2D-F). The reduction of expression of OsRab5a in callus RNA interference, however, led to the lethality of callus during differentiation (Fig.3D-F). The expression of OsRab5a was upregulated slightly by exogenous cytokinin (Fig.4), and was higher in the differentiation medium than that in selection medium (Fig.3G-I). These results suggest that OsRab5a plays an important role in callus differentiation probably through mediating hormone signal transduction.
16472405	Molecular characterization and differential expression of cytokinin-responsive type-A response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The response regulators represent the elements of bacterial two-component system and have been characterized from dicot plants like Arabidopsis but little information is available on the monocots, including the cereal crops. The aim of this study was to characterize type-A response regulator genes from rice, and to investigate their expression in various organs as well as in response to different hormones, including cytokinin, and environmental stimuli.

RESULTS: By analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice, we have identified ten genes encoding type-A response regulators based upon their high sequence identity within the receiver domain. The exon-intron organization, intron-phasing as well as chromosomal location of all the RT-PCR amplified rice (Oryza sativa) response regulator (OsRR) genes have been analyzed. The transcripts of OsRR genes could be detected by real-time PCR in all organs of the light- and dark-grown rice seedlings/plants, although there were quantitative differences. The steady-state transcript levels of most of the OsRR genes increased rapidly (within 15 min) on exogenous cytokinin application even in the presence of cycloheximide. Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress.

CONCLUSION: Ten type-A response regulator genes identified in rice, the model monocot plant, show overlapping/differential expression patterns in various organs and in response to light. The induction of OsRR genes by cytokinin even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis qualifies them to be primary cytokinin response genes. The induction of OsRR6 in response to different environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling. These results provide a foundation for further investigations on specific as well as overlapping cellular functions of type-A response regulators in rice.
16452316	Analysis of sialyltransferase-like proteins from Oryza sativa.	2006	J Biochem	Sialic acids are widely distributed among living creatures, from bacteria to mammals, but it has been commonly accepted that they do not exist in plants. However, with the progress of genome analyses, putative gene homologs of animal sialyltransferases have been detected in the genome of some plants. In this study, we cloned three genes from Oryza sativa (Japanese rice) that encode sialyltransferase-like proteins, designated OsSTLP1, 2, and 3, and analyzed the enzymatic activity of the proteins. OsSTLP1, 2, and 3 consist of 393, 396, and 384 amino acids, respectively, and each contains sequences similar to the sialyl motifs that are highly conserved among animal sialyltransferases. The recombinant soluble forms of OsSTLPs produced by COS-7 cells were analyzed for sialyltransferase-like activity. OsSTLP1 exhibited such activity toward the oligosaccharide Galbeta1,4GlcNAc and such glycoproteins as asialofetuin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and asialo-alpha1-acid glycoprotein; OsSTLP3 exhibited similar activity toward asialofetuin; and OsSTLP2 exhibited no sialyltransferase-like activity. The sialic acid transferred by OsSTLP1 or 3 was linked to galactose of Galbeta1,4GlcNAc through alpha2,6-linkage. This is the first report of plant proteins having sialyltransferase-like activity.
16428324	A higher plant has three different types of RPA heterotrimeric complex.	2006	J Biochem	Replication protein A (RPA) is a protein complex composed of three subunits known as RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14. Generally, only one version of each of the three RPA genes is present in animals and yeast (with the exception of the human RPA32 ortholog). In rice (Oryza sativa L.), however, two paralogs of RPA70 have been reported. We screened the rice genome for RPA subunit genes, and identified three OsRPA70 (OsRPA70a, OsRPA70b and OsRPA70c), three OsRPA32 (OsRPA32-1, OsRPA32-2 and OsRPA32-3), and one OsRPA14. Through two-hybrid assays and pull down analyses, we showed that OsRPA70a interacted preferentially with OsRPA32-2, OsRPA70b with OsRPA32-1, and OsRPA70c with OsRPA32-3. OsRPA14 interacted with all OsRPA32 paralogs. Thus, rice has three types of RPA complex: OsRPA70a-OsRPA32-2-OsRPA14 (type A), OsRPA70b-OsRPA32-1-OsRPA14 (type B), and OsRPA70c-OsRPA32-3-OsRPA14 (type C). Subcellular localization analysis suggested that the type-A RPA complex is required for chloroplast DNA metabolism, whereas types B and C function in nuclear DNA metabolism.
16397782	Molecular characterization of mature pollen-specific genes encoding novel small cysteine-rich proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Plant Cell Rep	In our previous cDNA microarray analysis, we identified 53 mature anther-specific genes, whose function was unknown, in rice. We reanalyzed these genes from the viewpoint of the specific amino acid motif. Out of 53 genes, three genes, Os-26, Os-32, and Os-169 (renamed as OsSCP1, OsSCP2, and OsSCP3), encoded cysteine-rich motif (Cys-X3-Cys-X13-Cys-X3-Cys), indicating that they were novel small cysteine-rich proteins. From the search of specific elements in promoter regions, several pollen-specific elements were found. In order to determine whether three promoters were functional in pollen or not, the gene constructs with promoter regions fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene were transformed into tobacco. Histochemical analysis showed that these promoters were active in the mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. Furthermore, OsSCP1 and OsSCP3 formed a multigene family tandemly in the rice genome. From the results, OsSCPs might have important roles in mature pollen development and pollen tube growth.
16290186	Comparison and evolution analysis of two rice subspecies LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES domain gene family and their evolutionary characterization from Arabidopsis.	2006	Mol Phylogenet Evol	The plant specific LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain (LBD) gene family has a potential role in lateral organ development. Thirty-five LBD genes in a japonica rice (Nipponbare) (designated OsJLBD) and in an indica rice (9311) (designated OsILBD) were identified based on the current databases of the two rice subspecies. A new rice LBD gene with two LOB domains and two predicted coiled coil structures in both subspecies was found, which is not found in other plant species based on the current NCBI Genbank database. OsJLBD and OsILBD genes have similar chromosomal distribution pattern. Both OsJLBD and OsILBD genes can be divided into 7 subclasses (classes Ia-e, II and III (see )) and no subclass-specific expression pattern was observed. No introns have been predicted in all class Ie genes in both OsJLBD and OsILBD subfamilies. The genome and tandem duplication has contributed to the neofunctionalization and formation of new rice subclasses, but the mechanism of diploidization and limited tandem duplication have contributed to fewer LBD genes in rice than in Arabidopsis. Functional studies of genes in subclasses may help to determine whether special sequence structure (intron-exon, spacing characters of motifs) has caused special expression pattern of subclasses.
16263700	Low temperature treatment at the young microspore stage induces protein changes in rice anthers.	2006	Mol Cell Proteomics	Male reproductive development in rice is very sensitive to various forms of environmental stresses including low temperature. A few days of cold treatment (<20 degrees C) at the young microspore stage induce severe pollen sterility and thus large grain yield reductions. To investigate this phenomenon, anther proteins at the early stages of microspore development, with or without cold treatment at 12 degrees C, were extracted, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and compared. The cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara and the relatively cold-tolerant cultivar HSC55 were used. The abundance of 37 anther proteins was changed more than 2-fold after 1, 2, and 4 days of cold treatment in cv. Doongara. Among them, one protein was newly induced, 32 protein spots were up-regulated, and four protein spots were down-regulated. Of these 37 protein spots, we identified two anther-specific proteins (putative lipid transfer protein and Osg6B) and a calreticulin that were down-regulated and a cystine synthase, a beta-6 subunit of the 20 S proteasome, an H protein of the glycine cleavage system, cytochrome c oxidase subunit VB, an osmotin protein homologue, a putative 6-phosphogluconolactonase, a putative adenylate kinase, a putative cysteine proteinase inhibitor, ribosomal protein S12E, a caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, and a monodehydroascorbate reductase that were up-regulated. Identification of these proteins is available upon request. Accumulation of these proteins did not vary greatly after cold treatment in panicles of cv. Doongara or in the anthers of the cv. HSC55. The newly induced protein named Oryza sativa cold-induced anther protein (OsCIA) was identified as an unknown protein. The OsCIA protein was detected in panicles, leaves, and seedling tissues under normal growth conditions. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of OsCIA mRNA expression showed no significant change between low temperature-treated and untreated plants. A possible regulatory role for the newly induced protein is proposed.
16200395	Structure and expression analysis of early auxin-responsive Aux/IAA gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Auxin exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development by regulating the expression of early auxin-responsive genes of auxin/indoleacetic acid (Aux/IAA), small auxin-up RNA, and GH3 classes. These genes have been studied extensively in dicots like soybean and Arabidopsis. We had earlier characterized a cDNA of the first monocot member of Aux/IAA family from rice. The achievement of the large scale rice genome sequencing combined with the availability of full-length cDNA sequences from Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopedia provided us the opportunity to draw up the first comprehensive list of Aux/IAA genes in a monocot. By screening the available databases, we have identified 31 Aux/IAA genes having high sequence identity within the conserved domains I, II, III, and IV. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the Oryza sativa indoleacetic acid (OsIAA) genes is reported. The rice Aux/IAA proteins can be classified in two groups (A and B) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis Aux/IAA proteins. An evolutionary pattern of the rice Aux/IAA genes has been discussed by analyzing their structure (exon/intron organization) and duplications. Interestingly, the duplication of rice Aux/IAA genes was found to be associated with chromosomal block duplication events in rice. The in-silico analysis has been complemented with real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to quantify transcript levels of all Aux/IAA family members. OsIAA genes showed differential and overlapping organ-specific expression patterns in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants. Although auxin enhanced the transcript abundance of most of the OsIAA genes, the effect was more pronounced on OsIAA9, 14, 19, 20, 24, and 31. These results provide a foundation for future studies on elucidating the precise role of rice Aux/IAA genes in early steps of auxin signal transduction.
16200411	Functional analysis of DNA sequences controlling the expression of the rice OsCDPK2 gene.	2006	Planta	Plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. Their expression is finely tuned in different tissues and in response to specific signals, but the mechanism of such a regulation is still largely unknown. OsCDPK2 gene expression is modulated in vivo during rice (Oryza sativa L.) flower development and is downregulated by white light in leaves. In order to identify OsCDPK2 regulatory sequences, we amplified and cloned both the 5' and 3'-flanking regions of the gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader sequence is interrupted by an intron, whose regulatory role was investigated. Different ss-gucuronidase (GUS) expression vectors, carrying combinations of the putative OsCDPK2 regulatory regions, were generated and GUS expression was analyzed both in transient assays and in transgenic rice plants. The whole 5'-flanking sequence was able to drive GUS expression in rice calli and leaves transiently transformed with the biolistic technique. Analysis of the GUS expression pattern in transgenic plants revealed strong activity in root tips, leaf veins and mesophyll cells, in flower reproductive organs and in mature pollen grains. Expression was also shown to be subject to an intron-mediated enhancement (IME) mechanism, since the deletion of the leader intron sequence from chimeric OsCDPK2::GUS plasmids almost completely abolished GUS activity. Furthermore, in transiently transformed leaves, GUS expression driven by the OsCDPK2 promoter-leader region was constitutively observed regardless of light or dark exposure. Light-regulated expression was restored by inserting the OsCDPK2 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) downstream of the chimeric OsCDPK2::GUS transcription unit, suggesting that light down-regulation is mediated by a mechanism driven by the 3'UTR.
17309686	Functional analysis of rice NPR1-like genes reveals that OsNPR1/NH1 is the rice orthologue conferring disease resistance with enhanced herbivore susceptibility.	2007	Plant Biotechnol J	The key regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance, NPR1, is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa L.). Investigation in depth is needed to provide an understanding of NPR1-mediated resistance and a practical strategy for the improvement of disease resistance in the model crop rice. The rice genome contains five NPR1-like genes. In our study, three rice homologous genes, OsNPR1/NH1, OsNPR2/NH2 and OsNPR3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and rice blast Magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. We confirmed that OsNPR1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant. Over-expression of OsNPR1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants. The OsNPR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and moved into the nucleus after redox change. Mutations in its conserved cysteine residues led to the constitutive localization of OsNPR1(2CA)-GFP in the nucleus and also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity in transgenic rice. Different subcellular localizations of OsNPR1 antagonistically regulated SA- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes, but not SA and JA levels, indicating that OsNPR1 might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the SA- and JA-dependent pathways in rice. This study demonstrates that rice has evolved an SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance similar to that in Arabidopsis, and also provides a practical approach for the improvement of disease resistance without the penalty of decreased herbivore resistance in rice.
17111096	Phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase-mediated signalling is required for benzothiadiazole-induced oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death in rice suspension-cultured cells.	2007	Protoplasma	The involvement of phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase (PLC/DGK)-mediated signalling in oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death was studied in rice suspension-cultured cells treated with benzothiadiazole (BTH) and infected by Xanthomonas oryza pv. oryza (Xoo), the causal agent of rice leaf blight disease. Treatment of rice suspension cells with BTH resulted in a significant oxidative burst, as indicated by accumulation of superoxide anion and H(2)O(2), and hypersensitive cell death, as determined by Evans blue staining. A peak in oxidative burst was detected 3-4 h after BTH treatment and hypersensitive cell death was observed 8 h after treatment. In addition, significant oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death were detected in BTH-treated suspension cells, but not in untreated control cells, after Xoo infection. Scavengers and antioxidants of active oxygen species, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, N-acetylcysteine, and flavone, reduced significantly the BTH-induced oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death, indicating that oxidative burst is required for BTH-induced hypersensitive cell death. Expression of the PLC/DGK pathway genes, a diacylglycerol kinase gene, OsDAGK1, and a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C gene, OsPI-PLC1, and a defence-related EREBP transcriptional factor gene, OsBIERF3, was activated in rice cells after BTH treatment and in the BTH-treated cells after Xoo infection. Treatment of rice cells with phosphatidic acid, a phospholipid signalling molecule, resulted in the production of oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death. However, neomycin, a PLC inhibitor, inhibited partially but not completely the production of oxidative burst, hypersensitive cell death, and expression of OsBIERF3 and OsDAGK1 induced by BTH in rice cells. These results suggest that PLC/DGK-mediated signalling plays an important role in BTH-induced oxidative burst, hypersensitive response, and activation of defence response in rice.
17541632	Identification and fine mapping of a thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Planta	A thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient mutant was isolated from more than 15,000 transgenic rice lines. The mutant displayed normal phenotype at 23 degrees C or lower temperature (permissive temperature). However, when grown at 26 degrees C or higher (nonpermissive temperature) the plant exhibited an abnormal phenotype characterized by yellow green leaves. Genetic analysis revealed that a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene is responsible for the mutation, which is tentatively designed as cde1(t) (chlorophyll deficient 1, temporally). PCR analysis and hygromycin resistance assay indicated the mutation was not caused by T-DNA insertion. To isolate the cde1(t) gene, a map-based cloning strategy was employed and 15 new markers (five SSR and ten InDels markers) were developed. A high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the cde1(t) gene was made using F(2) and F(3) population consisting of 1,858 mutant individuals. Finally, the cde1(t) gene was mapped in 7.5 kb region between marker ID10 and marker ID11 on chromosome 2. Sequence analysis revealed only one candidate gene, OsGluRS, in the 7.5 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the cde1(t) mutant showed that a missense mutation occurred in the mutant. So the OsGluRS gene (TIGR locus Os02 g02860) which encode glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was identified as the Cde1(t) gene.
17624547	A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice.	2007	Planta	OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox6) is an ortholog of lg3 (Liguleless3) in maize. We generated a novel allele, termed OSH6-Ds, by inserting a defective Ds element into the third exon of OSH6, which resulted in a truncated OSH6 mRNA. The truncated mRNA was expressed ectopically in leaf tissues and encoded the N-terminal region of OSH6, which includes the KNOX1 and partial KNOX2 subdomains. This recessive mutant showed outgrowth of bracts or produced leaves at the basal node of the panicle. These phenotypes distinguished it from the OSH6 transgene whose ectopic expression led to a "blade to sheath transformation" phenotype at the midrib region of leaves, similar to that seen in dominant Lg3 mutants. Expression of a similar truncated OSH6 cDNA from the 35S promoter (35S::DeltaOSH6) confirmed that the ectopic expression of this product was responsible for the aberrant bract development. These data suggest that OSH6-Ds interferes with a developmental mechanism involved in bract differentiation, especially at the basal nodes of panicles.
17938955	Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice.	2008	Planta	Enzyme 12-oxophytodienoate (OPDA) reductase (EC1.3.1.42), which is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), catalyses the reduction of 10, 11-double bonds of OPDA to yield 3-oxo-2-(2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0). The rice OsOPR1 gene encodes OPDA reductase (OPR) converting (-)-cis-OPDA preferentially, rather than (+)-cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis. Recombinant OsOPR7-His protein efficiently catalysed the reduction of both enantiomers of cis-OPDA, similar to the OPR3 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The expression of OsOPR7 mRNA was induced and reached maximum levels within 0.5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression. The GFP-OsOPR7 fusion protein was detected exclusively in peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene. We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice.
18066586	Novel rice OsSIPK is a multiple stress responsive MAPK family member showing rhythmic expression at mRNA level.	2008	Planta	We report isolation and transcriptional profiling of rice (Oryza sativa L.) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), OsSIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase). OsSIPK gene is located on chromosome 6 most probably existing as a single copy in the rice genome, and encodes 398 amino acid polypeptide having the MAPK family signature and phosphorylation activation motif TEY. Steady state mRNA analyses of OsSIPK showed weak constitutive expression in leaves of 2-week-old rice seedlings. A time course (30-120 min) experiment using a variety of elicitors and stresses revealed that the OsSIPK mRNA is strongly induced by jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethephon, abscisic acid, cycloheximide (CHX), JA/SA + CHX, cantharidin, okadaic acid, hydrogen peroxide, chitosan, sodium chloride, and cold stress (12 degrees C), but not with wounding by cut, gaseous pollutants ozone, and sulfur dioxide, high temperature, ultraviolet C irradiation, sucrose, and drought. Its transcription was also found to be tissue-specifically regulated, and followed a rhythmic dark induction in leaves. Finally, we showed that the OsSIPK protein is localized to the nucleus. From these results, OsSIPK can be implicated in diverse stimuli-responsive signaling cascades and transcription of certain genes.
18510577	Genetic engineering of improved nitrogen use efficiency in rice by the tissue-specific expression of alanine aminotransferase.	2008	Plant Biotechnol J	Summary Nitrogen is quantitatively the most essential nutrient for plants and a major factor limiting crop productivity. One of the critical steps limiting the efficient use of nitrogen is the ability of plants to acquire it from applied fertilizer. Therefore, the development of crop plants that absorb and use nitrogen more efficiently has been a long-term goal of agricultural research. In an attempt to develop nitrogen-efficient plants, rice (Oryza sativa L.) was genetically engineered by introducing a barley AlaAT (alanine aminotransferase) cDNA driven by a rice tissue-specific promoter (OsAnt1). This modification increased the biomass and grain yield significantly in comparison with control plants when plants were well supplied with nitrogen. Compared with controls, transgenic rice plants also demonstrated significant changes in key metabolites and total nitrogen content, indicating increased nitrogen uptake efficiency. The development of crop plants that take up and assimilate nitrogen more efficiently would not only improve the use of nitrogen fertilizers, resulting in lower production costs, but would also have significant environmental benefits. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance to the development of strategies to engineer enhanced nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants.
18425430	Oral administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor expressed in rice endosperm can increase leukocytes in mice.	2008	Biotechnol Lett	Human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) is used clinically to treat leucopenia typically caused by cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This study used multiple strategies to obtain very high expression levels of OsrhGM-CSF (14 microg/seed) in rice endosperm. Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled transgenic endosperm showed that rhGM-CSF was not only localized in protein bodies but was also distributed in the apoplast. A biological activity assay indicated that OsrhGM-CSF stimulated the growth of TF-1 cells in vitro. In addition, the transgene was used to effectively treat leucopenia by oral administration of the unprocessed transgenic grains. In cyclophosphamide-induced leucopenic mice, transgenic seeds produced a 27% (t=0.021) gain in leukocytes after 14 days feeding. Even in non-leucopenic mice, leukocyte gain was 37% (t=0.002) more than that of mice fed non-transgenic seeds. This study provides a novel approach to the use of oral unprocessed transgenic OsrhGM-CSF seeds to treat leucopenia.
18563580	Increased expression of OsPT1, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice.	2008	Biotechnol Lett	Most high-affinity phosphate transporter genes (OsPTs) in rice were highly induced in roots when phosphate was depleted. OsPT1, however, was highly expressed in primary roots and leaves regardless of external phosphate concentrations. This finding was confirmed histochemically using transgenic rice plants that express the GUS reporter gene under the control of the OsPT1 promoter, which exhibited high GUS activity even in the phosphate sufficient condition. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsPT1 gene accumulated almost twice as much phosphate in the shoots as did wild-type plants. As a result, transgenic plants had more tillers than did wild-type plants, which is a typical physiological indicator for phosphate status in rice.
18686304	Analysis of embryonic proteome modulation by GA and ABA from germinating rice seeds.	2008	Proteomics	The phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play essential and often antagonistic roles in regulating plant growth, development, and stress responses. Using a proteomics-based approach, we examined the role of GA and ABA in the modulation of protein expression levels during seed germination. Rice seeds were treated with GA (200 microM), ABA (10 microM), ABA followed by GA, GA followed by ABA, and water as a control and then incubated for 3 days. The embryo was dissected from germinated seeds, and proteins were subjected to 2-DE. Approximately, 665 total protein spots were resolved in the 2-D gels. Among them, 16 proteins notably modulated by either GA or ABA were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Northern analyses demonstrated that expression patterns of 13 of these 16 genes were consistent with those of the proteome analysis. Further examination of two proteins, rice isoflavone resuctase (OsIFR) and rice PR10 (OsPR10), using Western blot and immunolocalization, revealed that both are specifically expressed in the embryo but not in the endosperm and are dramatically downregulated by ABA.
18437520	Excision of a selective marker in transgenic rice using a novel Cre/loxP system controlled by a floral specific promoter.	2008	Transgenic Res	Based on the Cre/loxP system, we have developed a novel marker-free system mediating a direct auto-excision of loxP-flanked marker genes from T(1 )transgenic rice without any treatment or further offspring crossing. To achieve this, the floral-specific promoter OsMADS45 was isolated from rice and the expression patterns of OsMADS45 promoter was characterised by using the pOs45:GUS transgenic plants. Furthermore, the binary vector with Cre recombinase under the control of OsMADS45 promoter was constructed and introduced into rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and transgenic rice plants were generated. Southern blot analysis showed that auto-excision of the selective markers occurred in some T(1) progeny of the transgenic plants, suggesting that a high auto-excision frequency can be achieved with our Cre/loxP system. This auto-excision strategy provides an efficient way of removing the selectable marker gene from transgenic rice.
18545264	Genetic and physiological characterization of the OsCem mutant in rice: formation of connected embryos with multiple plumules or multiple radicles.	2008	Heredity (Edinb)	Establishment of the apical-basal axis is a critical event in plant embryogenesis. Two functionally distinct primordia (the plumule and radicle) are meristems that originate from the lower and upper regions, respectively, of the embryo and are arranged along an apical-basal axis. One rice mutant (OsCem), which alters the embryo axis pattern to produce multiple plumules and/or radicles, was characterized. The OsCem mutant plants showed three different phenotypes: a multiple-shoot type, a heart-shaped Siamese embryo having multiple plumules and a common radicle; a multiple-root type, an upside-down Y-shaped Siamese embryo possessing multiple radicles and a common plumule; and a connected twin type, a connected Siamese twin having two sets of plumules and radicles. These diverse phenotypes demonstrated that the upper and lower regions of the embryo axis have a similar potential to complete the full spectrum of the developmental program of multiple plumules and radicles, respectively. Genetic analysis and molecular mapping based on simple sequence repeat markers has revealed that a recessive gene was involved in the control of the connected Siamese embryo formation. By using an F2 mapping population derived from a cross between the OsCem mutant and the variety 95-15, the OsCem locus was mapped primarily to the short arm of chromosome 3 of rice (Oryza sativa) at the interval between markers RM148 (6.4 cM) and RM468 (7.5 cM). Subsequently, the OsCem locus was fine mapped to the interval between markers M5 (1.6 cM) and M6 (1.0 cM).
17111113	Compact shoot and leafy head 1, a mutation affects leaf initiation and developmental transition in rice (Oryza sativa L).	2007	Plant Cell Rep	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces lateral organs in a regular spacing (phyllotaxy) and at a regular interval (phyllochron) during the vegetative phase. In a Dissociation (Ds) insertion rice population, we identified a mutant, compact shoot and leafy head 1 (csl1), which produced massive number of leaves (~70) during the vegetative phase. In csl1, the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase was delayed by about 2 months under long-day conditions. With a reduced leaf size and severe dwarfism, csl1 failed to produce a normal panicle after the transition to reproductive growth. Instead, it produced a leafy panicle, in which all primary rachis-branches were converted to vegetative shoots. Phenotypically csl1 resembled pla mutants in short plastochron but was more severe in the conversion of the reproductive organs to vegetative organs. In addition, neither the expression nor the coding region of PLA1 or PLA2 was affected in csl1. csl1 is most likely a dominant mutation because no mutant segregant was observed in progeny of 67 siblings of the csl1 mutant. CSL1 may represent a novel gene, which functions downstream of PLA1 and/or PLA2, or alternatively functions in a separate pathway, involved in the regulation of leaf initiation and developmental transition via plant hormones or other mobile signals.
19103426	Genetic analysis and fine-mapping of a dwarfing with withered leaf-tip mutant in rice.	2008	J Genet Genomics	A dwarf mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by mutagenesis of ethylene methylsulfonate (EMS) treatment from Nipponbare was identified. The mutant exhibited phenotypes of dwarfism and withered leaf tip (dwl1). Based on the internode length of dwl1, this mutant belongs to the dm type of dwarfing. Analysis of elongation of the second sheath and alpha-amylase activity in endosperm showed that the phenotype caused by dwl1 was insensitive to gibberellin acid treatment. Using a large F2 population derived from a cross between the dwl1 and an indica rice variety, TN1, the DWL1 gene was mapped to the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 3. Fine-mapping delimited it into a 46 kb physical distance between two STS markers, HL921 and HL944, where 6 open reading frames were predicted. Cloning of DWL1 will contribute to dissecting molecular mechanism that regulates plant height in rice, which will be beneficial to molecular assisted selection of this important trait.
19422603	Comparative sequence analyses of the major quantitative trait locus phosphorus uptake 1 (Pup1) reveal a complex genetic structure.	2009	Plant Biotechnol J	The phosphorus uptake 1 (Pup1) locus was identified as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for tolerance of phosphorus deficiency in rice. Near-isogenic lines with the Pup1 region from tolerant donor parent Kasalath typically show threefold higher phosphorus uptake and grain yield in phosphorus-deficient field trials than the intolerant parent Nipponbare. In this study, we report the fine mapping of the Pup1 locus to the long arm of chromosome 12 (15.31-15.47 Mb). Genes in the region were initially identified on the basis of the Nipponbare reference genome, but did not reveal any obvious candidate genes related to phosphorus uptake. Kasalath BAC clones were therefore sequenced and revealed a 278-kbp sequence significantly different from the syntenic regions in Nipponbare (145 kb) and in the indica reference genome of 93-11 (742 kbp). Size differences are caused by large insertions or deletions (INDELs), and an exceptionally large number of retrotransposon and transposon-related elements (TEs) present in all three sequences (45%-54%). About 46 kb of the Kasalath sequence did not align with the entire Nipponbare genome, and only three Nipponbare genes (fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase, dirigent protein and aspartic proteinase) are highly conserved in Kasalath. Two Nipponbare genes (expressed proteins) might have evolved by at least three TE integrations in an ancestor gene that is still present in Kasalath. Several predicted Kasalath genes are novel or unknown genes that are mainly located within INDEL regions. Our results highlight the importance of sequencing QTL regions in the respective donor parent, as important genes might not be present in the current reference genomes.
19405033	Understanding rice plant resistance to the Brown Planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens): a proteomic approach.	2009	Proteomics	Engineering and breeding resistant plant varieties are the most effective and environmentally friendly ways to control agricultural pests and improve crop performance. However, the mechanism of plant resistance to pests is poorly understood. Here we used a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach for comparative analysis of expression profiles of proteins in rice leaf sheaths in responses to infestation by the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH), which is a serious rice crop pest. Proteins involved in multiple pathways showed significant changes in expression in response to BPH feeding, including jasmonic acid synthesis proteins, oxidative stress response proteins, beta-glucanases, protein; kinases, clathrin protein, glycine cleavage system protein, photosynthesis proteins and aquaporins. The corresponding genes of eight important proteins were further analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Proteomic and transcript responses that were related to wounding, oxidative and pathogen stress overlapped considerably between BPH-resistant (carrying the resistance gene BPH15) and susceptible rice lines. In contrast, proteins and genes related to callose metabolism remained unchanged and glycine cleavage system protein was up-regulated in the BPH-resistant lines, indicating that they have an efficient and specific defense mechanism. Our results provide new information about the interaction between rice and the BPH.
19210638	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Environ	We report here on the characterization of a putative Dof transcription factor gene in rice (Oryza sativa)--rice Dof daily fluctuations 1 (Rdd1). Daily oscillations in Rdd1 expression were retained after transferring to continuous dark (DD) or light (LL) conditions, indicating circadian regulation. However, Rdd1 showed arrhythmic expression in etiolated coleoptiles. Experiments revealed that the Rdd1 transcript accumulated up to 1 h after transferring from DD to LL conditions and decreased thereafter. We examined Rdd1 expression using phytochrome (phy)-deficient mutants, and the results showed that phyA and most likely phyB contributed to the regulation of Rdd1 expression. To further examine the role of Rdd1, transgenic rice plants were produced that carried Rdd1 in either a sense (RDD1-S) or antisense (RDD1-AS) orientation, driven by a constitutive promoter. The expression of endogenous Rdd1 in response to far-red light was found to be modified in RDD1-AS plants compared with wild-type (WT) or RDD1-S plants. In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded. This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy-regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice.
19203276	The pi40 gene for durable resistance to rice blast and molecular analysis of pi40-advanced backcross breeding lines.	2009	Phytopathology	Rice blast severely reduces production in both irrigated and water-stressed upland ecosystems of tropical and temperate countries. Nearly 50 blast resistance genes have been identified and some of those are incorporated into several rice cultivars. However, most of the resistance genes break down in a few years because of their race specificity and the rapid change in pathogenicity of the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). The objective of this study was to analyze advanced backcross breeding lines (ABL) possessing the gene Pi40 for durable rice blast resistance. In all, 4 resistant genotypes, 4 japonica cultivars, and 10 monogenic differential rice genotypes with some known resistance genes were bioassayed in the greenhouse using seven sequential plantings and 29 virulent M. grisea isolates of Korea. The genotypes with the Pi40 gene had <3% diseased leaf area, which was significantly below the disease threshold level of 40% considered for durable blast resistance. Moreover, the genotypes with the Pi40 gene expressed compatibility with only two to three virulent M. grisea isolates supporting durability of resistance, in contrast to susceptible cultivars with >50% diseased leaf area and 10 compatible isolates. Of the 10 known resistance genes tested, Piz-t, Piz-5, and Pi9 showed differential reactions to the pathogen isolates in seven plantings. Genotyping of the ABL with 260 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed rapid conversion toward recurrent parent genotypes with fewer donor chromosomal segments (5.3 to 14.5%). Our study based on a sequential testing and background selection of breeding lines with the resistance gene Pi40 provided valuable information for durable blast resistance breeding in rice.
19161350	Constitutive heterologous expression of avrXa27 in rice containing the R gene Xa27 confers enhanced resistance to compatible Xanthomonas oryzae strains.	2009	Mol Plant Pathol	The vascular pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and nonvascular pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) cause bacterial blight (BB) and bacterial leaf streak (BLS) diseases of rice, respectively. We have previously identified the avirulence gene avrXa27 from Xoo PXO99(A), which specifically induces the expression of the rice resistance gene Xa27, ultimately leading to resistance against BB disease in rice. In this study, we have generated a transgenic rice line (L24) that expresses avrXa27 constitutively under the control of the PR1 promoter, and have examined its role in the host-pathogen interaction. L24 is not more susceptible to BB, indicating that avrXa27 does not contribute to virulence. AvrXa27 retains avirulence activity in L24 and, after crossing with a line containing Xa27, progeny display phenotypic changes including inhibition of tillering, delay in flowering, stiff leaves, early leaf senescence and activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. On challenge with a variety of compatible strains of Xoo and Xoc strain L8, lines with both avrXa27 and Xa27 also show enhanced resistance to bacterial infection. The induction of Xa27 and subsequent inhibition of Xoc growth in Xa27 plants are observed on inoculation with Xoc L8 harbouring avrXa27. Our results indicate that the heterologous expression of avrXa27 in rice containing Xa27 triggers R gene-specific resistance and, at the same time, confers enhanced resistance to compatible strains of Xoo and Xoc. The expression of AvrXa27 and related proteins in plants has the potential to generate broad resistance in plants.
19159310	Real-time quantitative expression studies of the zearalenone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium graminearum.	2009	Phytopathology	The estrogenic mycotoxin zearalenone (ZON) produced by some Fusarium spp. causes reproductive problems and hyperestrogenic syndromes in mammals. In an effort to elucidate the molecular pathways of ZON production, we present a comparative real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression study of seven contiguous genes in the ZON biosynthetic cluster on sterile rice and during wheat and oat infection. Under ZON production on rice, the polyketide synthase (PKS) genes PKS4 and PKS13, alcohol oxidase FG12056 gene, and transcriptional regulator FG02398 gene showed similarly upregulated patterns, whereas the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NPS) FG02394, the K(+) channel beta subunit FG12015, and the protein kinase FG02399 displayed a variant pattern. During the same time period under wheat infection when no ZON was produced, the PKS genes and the NPS were downregulated relative to rice whereas the K(+) channel beta subunit gene FG12015 was markedly upregulated, suggesting that it may play a role in the infection process. This is the first expression study of ZON biosynthetic genes in planta. The results give insight into the regulation and activities of the ZON gene cluster under different experimental systems and suggest a connection between ZON and a K(+) channel that could reveal a novel function for ZON in Fusarium spp.
19001425	Mechanisms associated with tolerance to flooding during germination and early seedling growth in rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Flooding slows seed germination, imposes fatalities and delays seedling establishment in direct-seeded rice. This study describes responses of contrasting rice genotypes subjected to flooding or low oxygen stress during germination and discusses the basis of tolerance shown by certain cultivars.

METHODS: In one set of experiments, dry seeds were sown in soil and either watered normally or flooded with 10 cm of water. Seedling survival and shoot and root growth were assessed and seed portions of germinating seedlings were assayed for soluble sugars and starch concentrations. The whole germinating seedlings were assayed for amylase and peroxidase activities and for ethylene production. Activities of enzymes associated with anaerobic respiration were examined and gene expression was analysed separately with seeds germinating under different amounts of dissolved oxygen in dilute agar.

KEY RESULTS: Flooding during germination reduced survival but to a lesser extent in tolerant genotypes. Starch concentration in germinating seeds decreased while sugar concentration increased under flooding, but more so in tolerant genotypes. Amylase activity correlated positively with elongation (r = 0.85 for shoot and 0.83 for root length) and with plant survival (r = 0.92). Tolerant genotypes had higher amylase activity and higher RAmy3D gene expression. Ethylene was not detected in seeds within 2 d after sowing, but increased thereafter, with a greater increase in tolerant genotypes starting 3 d after sowing. Peroxidase activity was higher in germinating seeds of sensitive genotypes and correlated negatively with survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Under low oxygen stress, tolerant genotypes germinate, grow faster and more seedlings survive. They maintain their ability to use stored starch reserves through higher amylase activity and anaerobic respiration, have higher rates of ethylene production and lower peroxidase activity as germinating seeds and as seedlings. Relevance of these traits to tolerance of flooding during germination and early growth is discussed.
18974101	Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond.	2009	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Submergence is a recurring problem in the rice-producing rainfed lowlands of south and south-east Asia. Developing rice cultivars with tolerance of submergence and with agronomic and quality traits acceptable to farmers is a feasible approach to address this problem. The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F(1) hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele.

METHODS: Tolerant varieties were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing through two or three backcrosses, and their performance was evaluated to determine the effect of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds. The roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data.

KEY RESULTS: All mega varieties with Sub1 introgression had a significantly higher survival rate than the original parents. An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant. Survival rates and Sub1A expression were significantly lower in heterozygotes compared with the homozygous tolerant parent.

CONCLUSIONS: Sub1 provided a substantial enhancement in the level of tolerance of all the sensitive mega varieties. Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important. Lack of dominance of Sub1 suggests that the Sub1A-1 allele should be carried by both parents for developing tolerant rice hybrids.
18930897	[Genetic analysis and gene mapping of an early flowering and multi-ovary mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.).].	2008	Yi Chuan	A rice floral mutant was obtained from a japonica variety Zhonghua 11, which was characterized with the phenotype of more stamens, more pistils and early flowering. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was designed as floral organ number 5 (fon5). To map fon5, an F2 population was derived from the cross between Huajingxian 74 and fon5 mutant. Gene fon5 was roughly mapped between the microsatellite markers RM400 and RM412 on chromosome 6 with genetic distances of 10.5 and 1.6 cM, respectively. Then, six new po-lymorphic InDel markers were developed in the region. According to the physical information of the markers, locus fon5 was finally delimited to a region of 116 kb.
18850055	Expression and characterization of rice putative PAUSED gene.	2008	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	In Arabidopsis, PAUSED (PSD) encodes the ortholog of los1p/exportin-t, which mediates the nuclear export of transfer RNA (tRNA) in yeast and mammals. However, in monocot plants such as rice, knowledge of the corresponding ortholog is limited, and its effects on growth development and productivity remain unknown. In this study, we verified a rice transfer-DNA insertional mutant psd line and analyzed its phenotypes; the mutant displayed severe morphological defects including retarded development and low fertility compared with wild-type rice. Examining intronless tRNA-Tyr and intron-containing pre-tRNA-Ala expression levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction with Northern blot analysis between wild-type and mutant leaf tissue suggested that rice PSD might be involved in tRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Additionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PSD transcript was expressed throughout normal rice plant development, and subcellular localization assays showed that rice PSD protein was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In summary, our data implied that the putative PSD gene might be indispensable for normal rice development and its function might be the same as that of Arabidopsis PSD.
18831036	Solution structures and DNA binding properties of the N-terminal SAP domains of SUMO E3 ligases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oryza sativa.	2009	Proteins	SUMO E3 ligase of the Siz/PIAS family that promotes sumoylation of target proteins contains SAP motif in its N-terminal region. The SAP motif with a consensus sequence of 35 residues was first proposed to be as a new DNA binding motif found in diverse nuclear proteins involved in chromosomal organization. We have determined solution structures of the SAP domains of SUMO ligases Siz1 from yeast and rice by NMR spectroscopy, showing that the structure of the SAP domain (residues 2-105) of rice Siz1 is a four-helix bundle with an up-down-extended loop-down-up topology, whereas the SAP domain (residues 1-111) of yeast Siz1 is comprised of five helices where the fifth helix alpha5 causes a significant change in the alignment of the four-helix bundle characteristic to the SAP domains of the Siz/PIAS family. We have also demonstrated that both SAP domains have binding ability to an A/T-rich DNA, but that binding affinity of yeast Siz1 SAP is at least by an order of magnitude higher than that of rice Siz1 SAP. Our NMR titration experiments clearly showed that yeast Siz1 SAP uses alpha2-helix for DNA binding more effectively than rice Siz1 SAP, which would result from the dislocation of this helix due to the existence of the extra helix alpha5. In addition, based on the structures of the SAP domains determined here and registered in Protein Data Bank, general features of structures of the SAP domains are discussed in conjunction with equivocal nature of their DNA binding.
18827181	Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant.	2008	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) DELLA protein SLR1 acts as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. GA perception by GID1 causes SLR1 protein degradation involving the F-box protein GID2; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination. In GA-insensitive and GA biosynthesis mutants, SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) accumulates to high levels, and the severity of dwarfism is usually correlated with the level of SLR1 accumulation. An exception is the GA-insensitive F-box mutant gid2, which shows milder dwarfism than mutants such as gid1 and cps even though it accumulates higher levels of SLR1. The level of SLR1 protein in gid2 was decreased by loss of GID1 function or treatment with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, and dwarfism was enhanced. Conversely, overproduction of GID1 or treatment with GA(3) increased the SLR1 level in gid2 and reduced dwarfism. These results indicate that derepression of SLR1 repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and GID1 alone and does not require F-box (GID2) function. Evidence for GA signaling without GID2 was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, GID1, and SLR1 in the gid2 mutant. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the release of GA suppression that does not require DELLA protein degradation.
18817453	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity.	2008	PLoS Biol	Perception of extracellular signals by cell surface receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic development and immunity. Kinases that are associated with the receptors or are part of the receptors themselves modulate signaling through phosphorylation events. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) XA21 receptor kinase is a key recognition and signaling determinant in the innate immune response. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15). The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. XB15 fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and from transgenic rice carry PP2C activity. Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner. A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding. Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance. Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response.
18755262	A bioinformatic and transcriptomic approach to identifying positional candidate genes without fine mapping: an example using rice root-growth QTLs.	2008	Genomics	Fine mapping can accurately identify positional candidate genes for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) but can be time consuming, costly, and, for small-effect QTLs with low heritability, difficult in practice. We propose an alternative approach, which uses meta-analysis of original mapping data to produce a relatively small confidence interval for target QTLs, lists the underlying positional candidates, and then eliminates them using whole-genome transcriptomics. Finally, sequencing is conducted on the remaining candidate genes allowing identification of allelic variation in either expression or protein sequence. We demonstrate the approach using root-growth QTLs on chromosomes 2, 5, and 9 of the Bala x Azucena rice mapping population. Confidence intervals of 10.5, 9.6, and 5.4 cM containing 189, 322, and 81 genes, respectively, were produced. Transcriptomics eliminated 40% of candidate genes and identified nine expression polymorphisms. Sequencing of 30 genes revealed that 57% of the predicted proteins were polymorphic. The limitations of this approach are discussed.
18723578	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex.	2008	Plant Cell	A small GTPase, Rac1, plays a key role in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity as part of a complex of regulatory proteins. Here, we used affinity column chromatography to identify rice RACK1 (for Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1) as an interactor with Rac1. RACK1 functions in various mammalian signaling pathways and is involved in hormone signaling and development in plants. Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1. Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin. Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection. Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings. RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance. These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex.
18713442	Relationships between phosphatidylglycerol molecular species of thylakoid membrane lipids and sensitivities to chilling-induced photoinhibition in rice.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	In an attempt to explore the relationships between phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecular species of thylakoid membrane lipids and sensitivities to chilling-induced photoinhibition, PG molecular species, D1 protein, electron transport activities of thylakoid membrane and the potential quantum yield (F(v)/F(m)) in rice treated under middle and low photon flux density (PFD) at 11 degrees C were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, enzyme hydrolysis, gas phase chromatography (GC) and so on. Results showed that the major molecular species of PGs in rice thylakoid membrane were 18:3/16:0, 18:3/16:1(3t), 18:2/16:0, 18:2/16:1(3t), 18:1/16:0, 18:1/16:1(3t), 16:0/16:0, 16:0/16:1(3t). There were large differences in the contents of unsaturated PG molecular species such as 18:1 approximately 3/16:0 approximately 16:1(3t) and saturated PG molecular species like 16:0/16:0 approximately 16:1(3t) among japonica cv 9516 (j-9516), japonica-indica hybrid F1 j-9516/i-SY63 (ji-95SY) and indica cv Shanyou 63 (i-SY63). J-9516 containing higher contents of unsaturated PG molecular species was manifest in stable D1 protein contents under chill and tolerant to chill-induced photoinhibition. In contrast to j-9516, i-SY63 with lower contents of unsaturated PG molecular species, exhibited unstable D1 protein contents under chill and was sensitive to chill-induced photoinhibition. ji-95SY containing middle contents of unsaturated PG molecular species between those of j-9516 and i-SY63, exhibited mid extent of sensitivity to chill-induced photoinhibition. The losses in D1 protein also account for the inhibition in electron transport activity of thylakoid membrane and the observed decline in F(v)/F(m). The PG molecular species that is efficient in raising chilling-resistant capacity were those containing unsaturated fatty acids, namely, unsaturated PG molecular species. These results implied that the substrate selectivity of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in chloroplasts towards 16:0 or 18:1 displayed greatly the difference between japonica and indica rice. It was possible to enhance the capacity of resistance to chilling-induced photoinhibition by improving or modifying the GPAT gene.
18713364	Phenotypic characterization, genetic analysis and gene-mapping for a brittle mutant in rice.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Plant mechanical strength is an important agronomic trait of rice. An ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced rice mutant, fragile plant 2 (fp2), showed morphological changes and reduced mechanical strength. Genetic analysis indicated that the brittle of fp2 was controlled by a recessive gene. The fp2 gene was mapped on chromosome 10. Anatomical analyses showed that the fp2 mutation caused the reduction of cell length and cell wall thickness, increasing of cell width, and the alteration of cell wall structure as well as the vessel elements. The consequence was a global alteration in plant morphology. Chemical analyses indicated that the contents of cellulose and lignin decreased, and hemicelluloses and silicon increased in fp2. These results were different from the other mutants reported in rice. Thus, fp2 might affect the deposition and patterning of microfibrils, the biosynthesis and deposition of cell wall components, which influences the formation of primary and secondary cell walls, the thickness of cell walls, cell elongation and expansion, plant morphology and plant strength in rice.
18618285	Expression of Dm-AMP1 in rice confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani.	2009	Transgenic Res	Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani, are among the most important pathogens of rice, severely limiting its productivity. Dm-AMP1, an antifungal plant defensin from Dahlia merckii, was expressed in rice (Oryza sativa L. sp. indica cv. Pusa basmati 1) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Expression levels of Dm-AMP1 ranged from 0.43% to 0.57% of total soluble protein in transgenic plants. It was observed that constitutive expression of Dm-AMP1 suppresses the growth of M. oryzae and R. solani by 84% and 72%, respectively. Transgenic expression of Dm-AMP1 was not accompanied by an induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression, indicating that the expression of DmAMP1 directly inhibits the pathogen. The results of in vitro, in planta and microscopic analyses suggest that Dm-AMP1 expression has the potential to provide broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
18558385	Diversity and stability study on rice mutants induced in space environment.	2008	Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics	To further study the characteristics of changes on the molecular level of rice mutants induced in space environment, we analyzed proteins in leaves and seeds of four rice mutants (two high-tillering and two low-tillering) in the 8(th) and 9(th) generations after a 15-day spaceflight, and compared with their ground controls by two-dimentional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). In addition, the albumin, globulin, prolamine, glutelin, and amylose of the mutant seeds were analyzed by RPLC and ultra-violet spectrometry. The results showed that the low-abundance proteins of leaves in the peak tillering stage are more likely to be induced compared with their corresponding controls. The albumin, globulin, and prolamine of the mutant seeds revealed changes when compared with their controls, and the characteristics of changes in different mutants were stably inherited in the 8(th) and 9(th) generations, suggesting that they can be used as bio markers to identity the mutants induced by spaceflight. Moreover, two proteins (SSP9111 and SSP6302) were found to be expressed with high intensity (two-fold change) in different mutants, which were both correlated with photosystem according to mass spectrometry and database searching.
18487614	Beta-1,3:1,4-glucan synthase activity in rice seedlings under water.	2008	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The metabolism of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan regulates the mechanical properties of cell walls, and thereby changes the elongation growth of Poaceae plants. A previous study has shown that elongation growth of rice coleoptiles under water is enhanced by increased activity of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan hydrolases; however, the involvement of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase activity in elongation growth under water has not yet been clarified.

METHODS: The beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase activity in a microsomal fraction prepared from rice seedlings grown under water was compared with that from control seedlings grown in air. The change under water in the relative expression level of CslF6, a major isoform of the beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase genes, was examined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR.

KEY RESULTS: The level of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase activity in submerged seedlings decreased to less than 40 % of that of the control seedlings and was accompanied by a significant reduction in the amount of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan in the cell walls. Under water, the expression of CslF6 was reduced to less than 20 % of the unsubmerged control. Bubble aeration partially restored both beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase activity and the expression of CslF6 under water, correlating with suppression of the submergence-induced elongation growth of coleoptiles.

CONCLUSIONS: Submergence down-regulates the expression of the CslF6 gene, leading to a decreased level of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase activity. Together with the increased activity of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan hydrolases, the decreased activity of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthase contributes to the decrease in the amount of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan in the cell walls under water. The suppression of beta-1,3 : 1,4-glucan synthesis under water may be mainly due to oxygen depletion.
18464639	[Regulation effect of exogenous salicylic acid on weed suppression and molecular physiological characteristics of allelopathic rice].	2008	Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao	To investigate the feasibility of using exogenous salicylic acid (SA) to regulate the allelopathic weed suppression of rice, this paper studied the effects of different concentrations exogenous SA on the weed-suppression and physiological-biochemical characteristics of allelopathic rice PI312777, and the relative expression quantity of gene ZB8 in the rice by real time quantitative RT-PCR (FQ-PCR). The results showed that exogenous SA induced the enhancement of the allelopathic potential of donor rice in suppressing target weed plants, and this inducing effect was SA dose and treatment time dependent. After foliar spraying SA, the inhibitory effect of PI312777 on barnyardgrass increased significantly, and the root vigor and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities of PI312777 increased, while its catalase (CAT) activity decreased. The reverse was true for the target weed barnyardgrass. At the same time, the phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) activity of PI312777 increased significantly, leading to an increase of the total content of phenols. Among the test concentrations of SA, 0.2 mmol x L(-1) had the best inducing effect, under which, the relative expression quantity of ZB8 increased first and decreased then, with a peak at 24 hours after treatment.
18461470	A rice lipid transfer protein binds to plasma membrane proteinaceous sites.	2009	Mol Biol Rep	Nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) is usually basic and secreted low-molecular-mass protein in plants. The 3-D structure of nsLTP1 resembles that of elicitin produced by the plant pathogen Phytophthora cryptogea, which can bind to the plant plasma membrane putative receptor and activate the downstream responses. It is inferred that nsLTP1 may have similar binding sites on the plasma membranes. In this work, rice recombinant protein TRX-nsLTP110 labeled with (125)I was shown to bind to rice plasma membrane preparations in a saturable curve, with an apparent K(d) of 13.6 nM and B(max) of 150 fmol/mg proteins. Competition experiments revealed that the binding of TRX-nsLTP110 was specific, in contrast to the nonspecific binding of the fusion tag thioredoxin. Protease treatment assay showed that the binding sites were proteinaceous. Our results suggest that the binding sites of nsLTPs on plasma membranes may be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. They may be competed out from the binding sites under pathogen attack, supporting a role for nsLTP1 in host defense response to pathogens.
18449577	The 3D structure of the defense-related rice protein Pir7b predicted by homology modeling and ligand binding studies.	2008	J Mol Model	To better understand the ligand-binding mechanism of protein Pir7b, important part in detoxification of a pathogen-derived compound against Pyricularia oryzae, a 3D structure model of protein Pir7b was constructed based on the structure of the template SABP2. Three substrates were docking to this protein, two of them were proved to be active, and some critical residues are identified, which had not been confirmed by the experiments. His87 and Leu17 considered as 'oxyanion hole' contribute to initiating the Ser86 nucleophilic attack. Gln187 and Asp139 can form hydrogen bonds with the anilid group to maintain the active binding orientation with the substrates. The docking model can well interpret the specificity of protein Pir7b towards the anilid moiety of the substrates and provide valuable structure information about the ligand binding to protein Pir7b.
18430022	Genome-wide identification, classification, evolutionary expansion and expression analyses of homeobox genes in rice.	2008	FEBS J	Homeobox genes play a critical role in regulating various aspects of plant growth and development. In the present study, we identified a total of 107 homeobox genes in the rice genome and grouped them into ten distinct subfamilies based upon their domain composition and phylogenetic analysis. A significantly large number of homeobox genes are located in the duplicated segments of the rice genome, which suggests that the expansion of homeobox gene family, in large part, might have occurred due to segmental duplications in rice. Furthermore, microarray analysis was performed to elucidate the expression profiles of these genes in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development. Several genes with predominant expression during various stages of panicle and seed development were identified. At least 37 homeobox genes were found to be differentially expressed significantly (more than two-fold; P < 0.05) under various abiotic stress conditions. The results of the study suggest a critical role of homeobox genes in reproductive development and abiotic stress signaling in rice, and will facilitate the selection of candidate genes of agronomic importance for functional validation.
18426477	The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice.	2008	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Halophytes survive high salinity by using complex adaptive mechanisms. In a search for novel molecular mechanisms involved in salt acclimation, transcript analyses revealed increased expression of a SUI-homologous translation initiation factor eIF-1 in the salt-tolerant grass species Festuca rubra ssp. littoralis but not in rice. Upon analysis of the cell specificity of eIF-1 transcription by in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR), predominant signals were detected in rice leaf mesophyll. To further examine the role of eIF-1 in salt tolerance, transgenic rice plants were generated that over-express this factor under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter. The eIF-1 over-expressing lines showed improved growth under salt stress that was correlated with maintenance of photosynthetic activity and reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation in leaves. The transgenic rice lines also activated expression of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. In addition, an oxidoreductase that belongs to the aldo/keto reductase family was identified as a gene with modified expression in the eIF-1 over-expressing lines, compared with wild-type rice. Our data suggest that eIF-1 has a central function in salt-stress adaptation in rice by regulating ion accumulation and the intracellular redox status.
18407058	Genome-wide analysis of heat shock transcription factor families in rice and Arabidopsis.	2008	J Genet Genomics	The heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are the major heat shock factors regulating the heat stress response. They participate in regulating the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are critical in the protection against stress damage and many other important biological processes. Study of the HSF gene family is important for understanding the mechanism by which plants respond to stress. The completed genome sequences of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) constitute a valuable resource for comparative genomic analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. The identification of phylogenetic relationships among HSF proteins in these species is a fundamental step to unravel the functionality of new and yet uncharacterized genes belonging to this family. In this study, the full complement of HSF genes in rice and Arabidopsis has probably been identified through the genome-wide scan. Phylogenetic analyses resulted in the identification of three major clusters of orthologous genes that contain members belonging to both species, which must have been represented in their common ancestor before the taxonomic splitting of the angiosperms. Further analysis of the phylogenetic tree reveals a possible dicot specific gene group. We also identified nine pairs of paralogs, as evidence for studies on the evolution history of rice HSF family and rice genome evolution. Expression data analysis indicates that HSF proteins are widely expressed in plants. These results provide a solid base for future functional genomic studies of the HSF gene family in rice and Arabidopsis.
18366162	Increasing complexity of a diterpene synthase reaction with a single residue switch.	2008	J Am Chem Soc	Terpene synthases often catalyze complex reactions involving intricate series of carbocation intermediates. The resulting, generally cyclical, structures provide initial hydrocarbon frameworks that underlie the astonishing structural diversity of the enormous class of terpenoid natural products (>50,000 known), and these enzymes often mediate the committed step in their particular biosynthetic pathway. Accordingly, how terpene synthases specify product outcome has drawn a great deal of attention. In previous work, we have shown that mutational introduction of a hydroxyl group at specific positions within diterpene synthase active sites can "short circuit" complex cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions, resulting in the production of "simpler"' diterpenes. Here we demonstrate that the converse change, substitution of an Ile for Thr at the relevant position in a native pimaradiene synthase, leads to a dramatic increase in reaction complexity. Product outcome is shifted from the tricyclic pimaradiene to a rearranged tetracycle, aphidicol-15-ene. Thus, the nature of the residue at this position acts as a true switch for product outcome. In addition, the ability of aliphatic residue substitution to enable a more complex reaction emphasizes the importance of substrate conformation imposed by a largely inert active site. Furthermore, the profound plasticity of diterpene synthases exemplified by this single residue switch for product outcome is consistent with the screening/diversity-oriented hypothesis of natural products metabolism.
18349506	Analysis of probenazole-responsiveness of rice RPR1 upstream fragments.	2007	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	RPR1 (rice probenazole-responsive) is a rice gene, the expression of which is responsive to probenazole (PBZ), a synthetic compound that may act as a plant defense activator. It has been shown that RPR1 gene may be involved in disease resistance responses. In this study, a series of amplified fragments from the rice RPR1 promoter region, including 2,416 bp, 1,574 bp, 819 bp, 568 bp and 208 bp fragments upstream to the ATG translation start site, were prepared and linked to the coding region of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. Analysis of GUS gene transient expression in rice calli demonstrated that the 568 bp fragment was sufficient for probenazole responsiveness. Analysis of GUS gene stable expression in Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that the 2,416 bp and 1,574 bp fragments drove GUS expression only in shoot apical meristem and petiole. Identification of these PBZ-responsive fragments provides a basis on which PBZ-inducible gene regulatory systems can be constructed for experimental analysis of gene expression and for field application.
18338860	Proteomics analysis of rice lesion mimic mutant (spl1) reveals tightly localized probenazole-induced protein (PBZ1) in cells undergoing programmed cell death.	2008	J Proteome Res	Numerous reports have predicted/hypothesized a role for probenazole-induced protein (PBZ1) as a molecular marker in rice self-defense mechanism. However, the precise function of PBZ1 remains unknown. In the present study, we examined PBZ1 as a putative cell death marker in rice. For this, we focused our attention on a rice lesion mimic mutant (LMM), spotted leaf 1 ( spl1), which has been used to study the programmed cell death (PCD) phenomenon during lesion development in leaf. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE), 18 colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue stained protein spots were found to be differentially expressed in the leaves of spl1 mutant. After analysis of these spots by MALDI-TOF-MS, we identified the PBZ1 protein to be highly inducible in spl1. On the basis of these results, we proceeded to verify whether PBZ1 is highly expressed in the tissues undergoing PCD in rice. To do so, we performed immunoblot analysis and immunolocalization and used transgenic lines carrying the PBZ1 promoter fused with GFP. Results demonstrated that the expression levels and localizations of PBZ1 dramatically coincided with tissues undergoing PCD, namely, during leaf senescence, root aerenchyma formation, coleoptiles senescence, root cap, and seed aleurone layer. Furthermore, localization of the PBZ1 protein was also tightly correlated with TUNEL signal in the seed aleurone layer. As DNA fragmentation is a hallmark of PCD, this result clearly indicates a role for PBZ1 in rice tissues undergoing PCD. In conclusion, our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that PBZ1 is a molecular marker in rice defense response, and can serve as a novel potential marker for cell death/PCD in rice.
18315879	Rice yellow mottle virus stress responsive genes from susceptible and tolerant rice genotypes.	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The effects of viral infection involve concomitant plant gene variations and cellular changes. A simple system is required to assess the complexity of host responses to viral infection. The genome of the Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is a single-stranded RNA with a simple organisation. It is the most well-known monocotyledon virus model. Several studies on its biology, structure and phylogeography have provided a suitable background for further genetic studies. 12 rice chromosome sequences are now available and provide strong support for genomic studies, particularly physical mapping and gene identification.

RESULTS: The present data, obtained through the cDNA-AFLP technique, demonstrate differential responses to RYMV of two different rice cultivars, i.e. susceptible IR64 (Oryza sativa indica), and partially resistant Azucena (O. s. japonica). This RNA profiling provides a new original dataset that will enable us to gain greater insight into the RYMV/rice interaction and the specificity of the host response. Using the SIM4 subroutine, we took the intron/exon structure of the gene into account and mapped 281 RYMV stress responsive (RSR) transcripts on 12 rice chromosomes corresponding to 234 RSR genes. We also mapped previously identified deregulated proteins and genes involved in partial resistance and thus constructed the first global physical map of the RYMV/rice interaction. RSR transcripts on rice chromosomes 4 and 10 were found to be not randomly distributed. Seven genes were identified in the susceptible and partially resistant cultivars, and transcripts were colocalized for these seven genes in both cultivars. During virus infection, many concomitant plant gene expression changes may be associated with host changes caused by the infection process, general stress or defence responses. We noted that some genes (e.g. ABC transporters) were regulated throughout the kinetics of infection and differentiated susceptible and partially resistant hosts.

CONCLUSION: We enhanced the first RYMV/rice interaction map by combining information from the present study and previous studies on proteins and ESTs regulated during RYMV infection, thus providing a more comprehensive view on genes related to plant responses. This combined map provides a new tool for exploring molecular mechanisms underlying the RYMV/rice interaction.
18251929	The rice Mybleu transcription factor increases tolerance to oxygen deprivation in Arabidopsis plants.	2007	Physiol Plant	Mybleu is a natural incomplete transcription factor of rice (Oryza sativa), consisting of a partial Myb repeat followed by a short leucine zipper. We previously showed its localization to the apical region of rice roots and coleoptiles. Specifically, in coleoptiles, Mybleu is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas in roots, it is expressed only under aerobic conditions. Mybleu is able to dimerize with canonical leucine zippers and to activate transcription selectively. To investigate Mybleu function in vivo, we transformed Arabidopsis thaliana and evaluated several morphological, physiological and biochemical parameters. In agreement with a hypothesized role of Mybleu in cell elongation in the differentiation zone, we found that the constitutive expression of this transcription factor in Arabidopsis induced elongation in the primary roots and in the internodal region of the floral stem; we also observed a modification of the root apex morphology in transformed lines. Based on the high expression of Mybleu in anaerobic rice coleoptiles, we studied the role of this transcription factor in transgenic plants grown under low-oxygen conditions. We found that overexpression of this transcription factor increased tolerance to oxygen deficit. In transgenic plants, this effect may depend both on the maintenance of a higher metabolism during stress and on the higher expression levels of certain genes involved in the anaerobic response.
18221561	Genome-wide analysis of CCCH zinc finger family in Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Genes in the CCCH family encode zinc finger proteins containing the motif with three cysteines and one histidine residues. They have been known to play important roles in RNA processing as RNA-binding proteins in animals. To date, few plant CCCH proteins have been studied functionally.

RESULTS: In this study, a comprehensive computational analysis identified 68 and 67 CCCH family genes in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. A complete overview of this gene family in Arabidopsis was presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny, protein motifs, and chromosome locations. In addition, a comparative analysis between these genes in Arabidopsis and rice was performed. These results revealed that the CCCH families in Arabidopsis and rice were divided into 11 and 8 subfamilies, respectively. The gene duplication contributed to the expansion of the CCCH gene family in Arabidopsis genome. Expression studies indicated that CCCH proteins exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. Finally, evolutionary analysis showed that one subfamily is higher plant specific. The expression profile indicated that most members of this subfamily are regulated by abiotic or biotic stresses, suggesting that they could have an effective role in stress tolerance.

CONCLUSION: Our comparative genomics analysis of CCCH genes and encoded proteins in two model plant species provides the first step towards the functional dissection of this emerging family of potential RNA-binding proteins.
18208628	Identification, genetic characterization, GA response and molecular mapping of Sdt97: a dominant mutant gene conferring semi-dwarfism in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Genet Res	Semi-dwarfism is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding programmes. sd-1, termed the 'Green Revolution gene', confers semi-dwarf stature, increases harvest index, improves lodging resistance, and is associated with increased responsiveness to nitrogen fertilizer. It has contributed substantially to the significant increase in rice production. In this paper, a novel semi-dwarf mutant in rice is reported. Genetic analysis revealed that only a single dominant gene locus non-allelic to sd-1, temporarily designated Sdt97, is involved in the control of semi-dwarfism of the mutant. The semi-dwarfism of the mutant could be partly restored to the tall wild-type by application of exogenous GA3, suggesting that the mutant gene Sdt97 may be involved in the gibberellin (GA) synthesis pathway and not the GA response pathway in rice. A residual heterozygous line (RHL) population derived from a recombinant inbred line (RIL) was developed. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and bulked segregation analysis (BSA) combined with recessive class analysis (RCA) techniques were used to map Sdt97 to the long arm of chromosome 6 at the interval between two STS markers, N6 and TX5, with a genetic distance of 0.2 cM and 0.8 cM, respectively. A contig map was constructed based on the reference sequence aligned by the Sdt97 linked markers. The physical map of the Sdt97 locus was defined to a 118 kb interval, and 19 candidate genes were detected in the target region. This is the first time that a dominant semi-dwarf gene has been reported in rice. Cloning and functional analysis of gene Sdt97 will help us to learn more about molecular mechanism of rice semi-dwarfism.
18089549	The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB): 2008 update.	2008	Nucleic Acids Res	The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) was created to provide the genome sequence assembly of the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP), manually curated annotation of the sequence, and other genomics information that could be useful for comprehensive understanding of the rice biology. Since the last publication of the RAP-DB, the IRGSP genome has been revised and reassembled. In addition, a large number of rice-expressed sequence tags have been released, and functional genomics resources have been produced worldwide. Thus, we have thoroughly updated our genome annotation by manual curation of all the functional descriptions of rice genes. The latest version of the RAP-DB contains a variety of annotation data as follows: clone positions, structures and functions of 31 439 genes validated by cDNAs, RNA genes detected by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) technology and sequence similarity, flanking sequences of mutant lines, transposable elements, etc. Other annotation data such as Gnomon can be displayed along with those of RAP for comparison. We have also developed a new keyword search system to allow the user to access useful information. The RAP-DB is available at: http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/ and http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.
18070109	Identification of rice TUBBY-like genes and their evolution.	2008	FEBS J	The identification of TUBBY-like genes in organisms ranging from single-celled to multicellular eukaryotes has allowed the phylogenetic history of this gene family to be traced back to the early evolutionary stages of eukaryote development. Rice TUBBY-like genes were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 without any obvious clustering. On a genomic scale, it was revealed that the rice TUBBY-like gene family probably evolved mainly through segmental duplication produced by polyploidy. The altered selective constraints (or site-specific rate changes), related to functional divergence during protein evolution between plant and animal TUBBY-like genes, were statistically significant. Based on posterior probability analysis, five amino acid sites (103, 312, 315, 317 and 319) are thought to be responsible for functional divergence.
17988855	Genetics and phylogenetics of rice domestication.	2007	Curr Opin Genet Dev	With genetically divergent cultivars and ecologically distinct wild progenitors, rice has posed a great challenge to the genetic and phylogenetic studies of the origin and evolution of crop species. A growing body of phylogenetic evidence suggested that the diverged genomic backgrounds of indica and japonica rice cultivars were derived independently from genetically distinct wild populations. However, a domestication gene, sh4, which was responsible for the reduction of grain shattering, seems to have originated only once, and it is now fixed in both cultivars. Two models have been proposed to reconcile these data. Whereas the 'combination model' emphasizes the importance of early introgression between independently domesticated cultivars, the 'snowballing model' emphasizes the importance of introgression from local populations of wild species into an ancestral domesticated population. In either case, the domestication of rice was a dynamic process.
17907810	Genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism in domesticated rice.	2007	PLoS Genet	Domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the oldest domesticated crop species in the world, having fed more people than any other plant in human history. We report the patterns of DNA sequence variation in rice and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon, across 111 randomly chosen gene fragments, and use these to infer the evolutionary dynamics that led to the origins of rice. There is a genome-wide excess of high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in O. sativa varieties, a pattern that has not been reported for other crop species. We developed several alternative models to explain contemporary patterns of polymorphisms in rice, including a (i) selectively neutral population bottleneck model, (ii) bottleneck plus migration model, (iii) multiple selective sweeps model, and (iv) bottleneck plus selective sweeps model. We find that a simple bottleneck model, which has been the dominant demographic model for domesticated species, cannot explain the derived nucleotide polymorphism site frequency spectrum in rice. Instead, a bottleneck model that incorporates selective sweeps, or a more complex demographic model that includes subdivision and gene flow, are more plausible explanations for patterns of variation in domesticated rice varieties. If selective sweeps are indeed the explanation for the observed nucleotide data of domesticated rice, it suggests that strong selection can leave its imprint on genome-wide polymorphism patterns, contrary to expectations that selection results only in a local signature of variation.
17891549	Genomic targeting and mapping of tiller inhibition gene (tin3) of wheat using ESTs and synteny with rice.	2008	Funct Integr Genomics	Changes in plant architecture have been central to the domestication of wild species. Tillering or the degree of branching determines shoot architecture and is a key component of grain yield and/or biomass. Previously, a tiller inhibition mutant with monoculm phenotype was isolated and the mutant gene (tin3) was mapped in the distal region of chromosome arm 3AmL of Triticum monococcum. As a first step towards isolating a candidate gene for tin3, the gene was mapped in relation to physically mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and sequence tag site (STS) markers developed based on synteny with rice. In addition, we investigated the relationship of the wheat region containing tin3 with the corresponding region in rice by comparative genomic analysis. Wheat ESTs that had been previously mapped to deletion bins provided a useful framework to identify closely related rice sequences and to establish the most likely syntenous region in rice for the wheat tin3 region. The tin3 gene was mapped to a 324-kb region spanned by two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) of rice chromosome arm 1L. Wheat-rice synteny was exceptionally high at the tin3 region despite being located in the high-recombination, gene-rich region of wheat. Identification of tightly linked flanking EST and STS markers to the tin3 gene and its localization to highly syntenic rice BACs will assist in the future development of a high-resolution map and map-based cloning of the tin3 gene.
17650514	Functional conservation between CRABS CLAW orthologues from widely diverged angiosperms.	2007	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CRABS CLAW (CRC) encodes a transcription factor of the YABBY family that plays important roles in carpel and nectary development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Combined evolutionary and developmental studies suggest an ancestor of the CRC gene to have controlled carpel development in the last common ancestor of the angiosperms. Roles for CRC orthologues in leaf development and carpel specification in rice, and in nectary development in core eudicots, have accordingly been interpreted as derived. The aim of this study was to assess the capacity of CRC orthologues from a basal angiosperm and from rice to complement CRC mutants of arabidopsis. These experiments were designed to test the hypothesized ancestral role of CRC in the angiosperms, and to indicate whether putatively novel roles of various CRC orthologues resulted from changes to their encoded proteins, or from other molecular evolutionary events.

METHODS: The crc-1 mutant of arabidopsis was genetically transformed with the coding sequences of various CRC orthologues, and with paralogous YABBY coding sequences, under the control of the arabidopsis CRC promoter. The phenotypes of transformed plants were assessed to determine the degree of complementation of the crc-1 mutant phenotype in carpel fusion, carpel form and nectary development.

KEY RESULTS: The CRC orthologue from the basal angiosperm Amborella trichopoda partially complemented the crc-1 mutant phenotype in carpels, but not in nectaries. The CRC orthologue from rice partially complemented all aspects of the crc-1 mutant phenotype. Though most non-CRC YABBY coding sequences did not complement crc-1 mutant phenotypes, YABBY2 (YAB2) proved to be an exception.

CONCLUSIONS: The data support a hypothesized ancestral role for CRC in carpel development and suggest that novel roles for CRC orthologues in monocots and in core eudicots resulted principally from molecular changes other than those affecting their coding sequences.
17623303	Proteome analysis and characterization of phenotypes of lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf 6 in rice.	2007	Proteomics	Rice spotted leaf 6 (spl6) mutant produces lesions caused by spontaneous cell death in the absence of pathogenic infection. Expression of this genetic trait was developmentally programmed. After the tillering stage, small red and brown lesions were initiated in groups on the leaf blade. Eventually, the lesions formed parallel lines along the midrib of the leaf. Under light and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that thylakoid membranes of mesophyll chloroplasts were progressively damaged in the nonspotted section of the mutant leaf. However, chloroplasts were absent in the mesophyll cells of the spotted area of the spl6 mutant. These results indicated that lesion formation of the spl6 mutant might be caused by oxidative burst. Proteome analysis revealed that 159 protein spots were up or downregulated in comparison between spotted leaves of the spl6 mutant plants and normal leaves of the wild type. Among them, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), transketolase, thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX), ATP synthase, RuBisCO large subunit, and RuBisCO activase small subunit were not identified in the spl6 mutant but were abundant in the wild type. Especially, the absence of TPX and PDI might be the cause of the failure to protect cells against oxidative burst resulting in degradation of the thylakoid membranes and leading to programmed cell death and lesion development.
17622268	Structural diversity and evolution of the Rf-1 locus in the genus Oryza.	2007	Heredity (Edinb)	The Rf-1 locus in rice is agriculturally important as it restores fertility in plants with BT-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). The Rf-1 locus contains several duplicated copies of the gene responsible for restoration of fertility. We analyzed the genomic structure of the Rf-1 locus in the genus Oryza to clarify the structural diversity and evolution of the locus. We identified six genes (Rf-1A to Rf-1F) with homology to Rf-1 at this locus in Oryza species with an AA genome. The Rf-1 locus structures in the rice accessions examined were very complex and fell into at least six classification types. The nucleotide sequences of the duplicated genes and their flanking regions were highly conserved suggesting that the complex Rf-1 locus structures were produced by homologous recombination between the duplicated genes. The fact that complex Rf-1 locus structures were common to Oryza species that have evolved independently indicates that a duplication of the ancestral Rf-1 gene occurred early in rice evolution and that homologous recombination resulted in the diversification of Rf-1 locus structures. Additionally, the amino acid sequences of each duplicated gene were conserved between species. This suggests that the duplicated genes in the Rf-1 locus may have divergent functions and may act by controlling mitochondrial gene expression in rice as occurs in the restoration of CMS.
17608495	Indicated detection of two unapproved transgenic rice lines contaminating vermicelli products.	2007	J Agric Food Chem	We analyzed the DNA fragments extracted from four rice vermicelli products. The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice line, which has a construct similar to the GM Shanyou 63 line, was detected in some vermicelli products by identification of the junction region sequence between rice Act1 promoter and the Cry1Ac gene, and that between Cry1Ac and nos. In addition, we also detected a different Bt rice line by means of the junction region sequence between the maize ubiquitin promoter and cry1Ab gene and that between the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the hygromycin phosphotransferase in some vermicelli products. Accordingly, we for the first time have detected the two transgenic Bt rice lines contaminating rice vermicelli samples. Furthermore, we developed a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the simultaneous detection of both Bt rice lines.
17601611	Morphological, anatomical and genetic analysis for a rice mutant with abnormal hull.	2007	J Genet Genomics	A mutant with abnormal hull was first discovered from a twin-seedling strain W2555 in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The mutant had sparse branches and decreased number of florets from the base to the peak. Frequently, the florets at the top of the panicle did not develop completely. The underdeveloped florets often showed slender and white in their life cycle. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant traits were controlled by a single recessive gene (temporarily designated as ah). ah gene controlled the development of inflorescence meristem and the flower organ. The florets of mutant showed degenerated lemma and palea. Stamens and lodicules were homeoticly transformed into pistils and palea/lemma-like structures, respectively. It seemed that ah mutant phenotypes of the homeotic conversions in lodicules and stamens were very similar to that of the B loss-of-function spw1 gene reported previously in rice.
17587382	Modern elite rice varieties of the 'Green Revolution' have retained a large introgression from wild rice around the Pi33 rice blast resistance locus.	2007	New Phytol	During the breeding process of cultivated crops, resistance genes to pests and diseases are commonly introgressed from wild species. The size of these introgressions is predicted by theoretical models but has rarely been measured in cultivated varieties. By combining resistance tests with isogenic strains, genotyping and sequencing of different rice accessions, it was shown that, in the elite rice variety IR64, the resistance conferring allele of the rice blast resistance gene Pi33 was introgressed from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon (accession IRGC101508). Further characterization of this introgression revealed a large introgression at this locus in IR64 and the related variety IR36. The introgressed fragment represents approximately half of the short arm of rice chromosome 8. This is the first report of a large introgression in a cultivated variety of rice. Such a large introgression is likely to have been maintained during backcrossing only if a selection pressure was exerted on this genomic region. The possible traits that were selected are discussed.
17561926	Oral immunization with transgenic rice seeds expressing VP2 protein of infectious bursal disease virus induces protective immune responses in chickens.	2007	Plant Biotechnol J	The expression of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) host-protective immunogen VP2 protein in rice seeds, its immunogenicity and protective capability in chickens were investigated. The VP2 cDNA of IBDV strain ZJ2000 was cloned downstream of the Gt1 promoter of the rice glutelin GluA-2 gene in the binary expression vector, pCambia1301-Gt1. Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the recombinant vector was used to transform rice embryogenic calli, and 121 transgenic lines were obtained and grown to maturity in a greenhouse. The expression level of VP2 protein in transgenic rice seeds varied from 0.678% to 4.521% microg/mg of the total soluble seed protein. Specific pathogen-free chickens orally vaccinated with transgenic rice seeds expressing VP2 protein produced neutralizing antibodies against IBDV and were protected when challenged with a highly virulent IBDV strain, BC6/85. These results demonstrate that transgenic rice seeds expressing IBDV VP2 can be used as an effective, safe and inexpensive vaccine against IBDV.
17548332	[Cloning and characterization of RZF71 encoding a C2H2-type zinc finger protein from rice].	2007	Yi Chuan	A rice zinc-finger protein gene, RZF71, encoding the C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L. subs. Japonica) by RT-PCR approach. Gene RZF71 encodes a 25 kDa protein with 250 amino acids, which contains two typical C2H2 zinc finger domains. The expression profiling showed that RZF71 was constitutively expressed in roots, culms, leaves, and flowering spikes. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed RZF71 was strongly induced by high-salinity and 20% PEG6000 treatments, but not regulated by low temperature and ABA (abscisic acid) treatments. Tran-sient expression of the RZF71-GFP protein in onion epidermal cell showed that RZF71 was localized in cell nuclei. These results indicated that the RZF71 may play an important role in rice responses to salt and osmotic stresses as a transcription factor.
17472566	Gibberellin receptor and its role in gibberellin signaling in plants.	2007	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Gibberellins (GAs) are a large family of tetracyclic, diterpenoid plant hormones that induce a wide range of plant growth responses. It has been postulated that plants have two types of GA receptors, including soluble and membrane-bound forms. Recently, it was determined that the rice GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases that has high affinity only for biologically active GAs. Moreover, GID1 binds to SLR1, a repressor of GA signaling, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. Based on these observations, it has been concluded that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signaling in rice. More recently, Arabidopsis thaliana was found to have three GID1 homologs, AtGID1a, b, and c, all of which bind GA and interact with the five Arabidopsis DELLA proteins.
17469777	The inheritance of early heading in the rice variety USSR5.	2007	J Genet Genomics	USSR5, a japonica rice variety from the former Soviet Union, is an extremely early maturing rice variety. To elucidate the genetic basis for its early heading, genetic analysis was carried out by crossing it with a set of major gene nearly isogenic lines (NIL) and QTL-isogenic lines. The early heading of USSR5 was attributed to the presence of photoperiod-insensitive alleles at E(1) and Se-1 gene, the photoperiod-sensitive inhibitor gene i-Se-1, and the dominant earliness gene Ef-1. Analysis of a backcrossed population (BC(1)F(1)) derived from the cross USSR5 x N22 indicated that two quantitative trait loci (QTL) for early heading were located on chromosomes 7 and 8, accounting for 27.4% and 11.2% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, with both early alleles originating from USSR5. From an F(2) population of the same cross, early heading QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 9, and 10, with individual QTL accounting for between 4.1% and 15.4% of the phenotypic variance. Early heading alleles at four of these five QTLs originated from USSR5. A comparison of chromosomal locations suggests that one of these QTLs may be identical with the known gene Hd4 (E(1)). The relationship between the other QTLs and known genes for heading date are not clear. USSR5 is a promising source for propagating earliness for the development of improved early heading rice varieties.
17468779	LAZY1 controls rice shoot gravitropism through regulating polar auxin transport.	2007	Cell Res	Tiller angle of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important agronomic trait that contributes to grain production, and has long attracted attentions of breeders for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Although enormous efforts have been made over the past decades to study mutants with extremely spreading or compact tillers, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of tiller angle of cereal crops remains unknown. Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled. We show that LA1, a novel grass-specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT). Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants.
17237471	Genetic interaction between 2 tillering genes, reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) and tillering dwarf gene d3, in rice.	None	J Hered	Mutant genes, reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) and bunketsuwaito tillering dwarf (d3), affect tiller number in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in opposite directions. The d3 mutant was reported to increase tiller number and reduce plant stature. Our objective was to compare the phenotype of the d3rcn1 double mutant with each single mutant and parental rice cultivar "Shiokari" and to clarify whether the Rcn1 gene interacted with the D3 gene. We recovered a new rcn1 mutant from Shiokari and developed d3rcn1 double mutant with Shiokari genetic background. A new rcn1 mutant, designated as "S-97-61" exhibited a reduction in tiller number and plant stature to about the same level as the previously reported original rcn1 mutant. Three near-isogenic lines, rcn1 mutant, d3 mutant, and d3rcn1 double mutant, were grown together with the parental Shiokari. The reduction in tillering by the rcn1 mutation was independent of the d3 genotype, and tillering number of d3rcn1 double mutant was between those of the d3 and rcn1 mutants. These results demonstrated that the Rcn1 gene was not involved in the D3-associated pathway in tillering control.
17226056	A Honglian CMS line of rice displays aberrant F0 of F0F1-ATPase.	2007	Plant Cell Rep	Honglian (HL) is one of the three major types of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) of rice (Oryza sativa L) that has been commercially used in hybrid production. In previous studies, the CMS in HL is shown to be associated with a chimeric gene orfH79 that is cotranscribed with an extra atp6 in mitochondria. This study demonstrated that the intact F0F1-ATPase in HL CMS line was specifically reduced in both of its protein quantity and enzyme activity, whereas its F1 sector was not affected. It implies that the F0 sector presents a labile linkage with F1. In the presence of fertility restorer gene, F0F1-ATPase can be recovered. Furthermore, orfH79 transcripts were preferentially polyadenylated, and consequently degraded rapidly in florets of the restored hybrid plants, indicating that the atp6-orfH79 is involved in the sterile phenotype. With inhibition of cytochrome pathway of electron transfer chain, the biomass of the sterile plants grown in dark was significantly lower than that of the fertile lines. However, the respiration measurements showed an increase in the electron transferring capacity in the sterile plants, suggesting that the reduction of biomass in sterile line was caused by the disruption of F0F1-ATPase.
17208508	Submergence tolerance in rice requires Sub1A, an ethylene-response-factor-like gene.	2007	Trends Plant Sci	Submergence of rice (Oryza sativa) by flash flooding is a major constraint to rice production in Asia. Rice cultivars vary in their capacity to tolerate complete submergence; quantitative trait loci analyses have revealed that a large portion of this variation in submergence tolerance can be explained by one locus (Sub1) on chromosome 9. Two recently published papers (Takeshi Fukao et al. and Kenong Xu et al.) present evidence that a transcription factor belonging to the B-2 subgroup of the ethylene response factors (ERFs)/ethylene-responsive element binding proteins (EREBPs)/apetala 2-like proteins (AP2) within the Sub1 locus determines submergence tolerance in rice. These genes control highly conserved hormonal, physiological and developmental processes that determine the rate of elongation when submerged.
17138543	[Genetic analysis and SSR marker of tolerance to submergence in rice].	2006	Yi Chuan	Submergence stress has severe harm to rice (Oryza sativa L.) production. It is important to identify molecular markers associated with tolerance to submergence for marker-assisted selection (MAS). F1 and F2 populations ware obtained from reciprocal crosses between submergence tolerant parent FR13A and submergence sensitive parent IR39595-503-2-1-2. No difference in reciprocal crosses in F1 population was detected for tolerance to submergence. This indicates that the submergence character is controlled by nucleic factor(s). Tolerance to submergence derived from FR13A appeared to be a quantitative-qualitative trait as revealed by the segregation of F2 population in two submergent experiments. Under light submergence stress, multiple minor genes might work and the trait inherited quantitatively it appeared a quantity trait, While under severe submergence stress, it exhibited a qualitative inheritance controlled by a major gene. Among the 187 pairs of SSR primers, 73 (39%) were polymorphic between the two parents and were used to tag submergence in the F2 population. Primer RM219 was detected to be linked to submergence tolerant trait loci. This result confirmed that tolerance to submergence is controlled by the major gene sub1, which will be helpful in improvement of the trait in rice.
17136305	Isolated and characterization of a cDNA encoding ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP)/AP2-type protein, RCBF2, in Oryza sativa L.	2007	Biotechnol Lett	A transcription factor RCBF2 which interacts with C-repeat/DRE was isolated from Oryza sativa L. by a yeast one-hybrid method. Analysis of the deduced RCBF2 amino acid sequence revealed that RCBF2 contained a conserved ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP)/AP2 domain of 59 amino acids and a potential nuclear localization sequence. RCBF2 showed a high level of homology with other CBF family members only in AP2 domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RCBF2 might be different from other eight DRE-binding proteins on evolutionary relationship. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR (s-Q RT-PCR) analysis indicated the expression of RCBF2 gene was induced by cold, dehydration and high-salinity, but not by abscisic acid, and the transcription of RCBF2 gene accumulated primarily in rice immature seeds, growing point and shoots.
17103003	Co-bombardment, integration and expression of rice chitinase and thaumatin-like protein genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Conlon).	2007	Plant Cell Rep	Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins associated with degradation of structural components of pathogenic filamentous fungi were overexpressed in the two-rowed malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar Conlon. Transgenes were introduced by co-bombardment with two plasmids, one carrying a rice (Oryza sativa L.) chitinase gene (chi11) and another carrying a rice thaumatin-like protein gene (tlp). Each gene was under the control of the maize ubiquitin (Ubi1) promoter. Fifty-eight primary transformants from three independent transformation events were regenerated. T(1) plants with high rice chi11 and tlp protein expression levels were advanced to identify T(2) homozygotes by herbicide spray and subjected to further molecular analyses. T(3) progeny from one event (E2) had stable integration and expression of the rice chi11 and tlp while those from the other events (E1 and E3) showed stable integration only of tlp. The successful production of these lines overexpressing the antifungal chi and tlp proteins provides materials to test the effects of these genes on a variety of fungal diseases that attack barley and to serve as potential additional sources of disease resistance.
17075175	[Identification of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant msp1-4 and expression analysis of its UDT1 and GAMYB genes].	2006	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	A rice male-sterile mutant msp1-4 (MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE) with japonica cultivar '9522' background, was obtained in M(3) population treated with (60)Co gamma-ray. Results of genetic analysis indicated that the male-sterile phenotype was controlled by a single recessive locus. To map this locus, an F(2) population was constructed from the cross between the msp1-4 (japonica) and 'LongTeFu B' (indica). This locus was mapped between the two InDel markers, WY-4 and WY-8, with physical distance of 247 kb. A deletion with 10 base pairs between 758 bp and 767 bp in MSP1 open reading frame was confirmed by sequence analysis, which led to pre-termination of MSP1 translation. Phenotype analysis of msp1-4 indicated that it was similar to the msp1 mutant. To insight the expression change of rice anther developmental genes in this mutant, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out. The results showed that the expression level of rice UDT1 and GAMYB were reduced in msp1-4, implying that UDT1 and GAMYB are possibly the downstream genes of MSP1 gene in rice pollen development.
17056172	Multiple forms of alpha-glucosidase in rice seeds (Oryza sativa L., var Nipponbare).	2007	Biochimie	Two isoforms of alpha-glucosidases (ONG2-I and ONG2-II) were purified from dry rice seeds (Oryza sativa L., var Nipponbare). Both ONG2-I and ONG2-II were the gene products of ONG2 mRNA expressed in ripening seeds. Each enzyme consisted of two components of 6kDa-peptide and 88kDa-peptide encoded by this order in ONG2 cDNA (ong2), and generated by post-translational proteolysis. The 88kDa-peptide of ONG2-II had 10 additional N-terminal amino acids compared with the 88kDa-peptide of ONG2-I. The peptides between 6kDa and 88kDa components (26 amino acids for ONG2-I and 16 for ONG2-II) were removed by post-translational proteolysis. Proteolysis induced changes in adsorption and degradation of insoluble starch granules. We also obtained three alpha-glucosidase cDNAs (ong1, ong3, and ong4) from ripening seeds. The ONG1, ONG2, and ONG4 genes were situated in distinct locus of rice genome. The transcripts encoding ONG2 and ONG3 were generated by alternative splicing. Members of alpha-glucosidase multigene family are differentially expressed during ripening and germinating stages in rice.
17035185	[Genetic analysis of two extremely segregation distorted populations in rice (Oryza sativa L.)].	2006	Yi Chuan	Segregation distortion is a quite common phenomenon in living species and thought to be a potent evolutional force. The main reasons of distorted segregation ratios are responsible for the selection of gametes or sporophytes. In this study, two extreme segregation distortions from the progenies of lmi x 02428 and d6 x 93-11 were identified. The segregation ratio of molecular markers tightly linked with LMI and D6 genes were analyzed and skew segregation were found in the markers tested which were indicated by significant deviation from the expected Mendelian segregation ratio(1:2:1). The segregation distorted regions were detected between molecular markers ST8 and ST8-2 near the centromere of chromosome 8, and ST7-1 and ST7-3 near telomere of chromosome 7, respectively. Meanwhile, the results indicated that segregation distortion had related with the different crossed combinations.
17002881	Molecular analyses of the metallothionein gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	J Biochem Mol Biol	Metallothioneins are a group of low molecular mass and cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins, ubiquitously found in most living organisms. They play an important role in maintaining intracellular metal homeostasis, eliminating metal toxification and protecting against intracellular oxidative damages. Analysis of complete rice genome sequences revealed eleven genes encoding putative metallothionein (OsMT), indicating that OsMTs constitute a small gene family in rice. Expression profiling revealed that each member of the OsMT gene family differs not only in sequence but also in their tissue expression patterns, suggesting that these isoforms may have different functions they perform in specific tissues. On the basis of OsMT structural and phylogenetic analysis, the OsMT family was classified as two classes and class I was subdivided into four types. Additionally, in this paper we also present a complete overview of this family, describing the gene structure, genome localization, upstream regulatory element, and exon/intron organization of each member in order to provide valuable insight into this OsMT gene family.
16939006	Mapping and marker-assisted selection of a brown planthopper resistance gene bph2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Nilaparvata lugens Stål (brown planthopper, BPH), is one of the major insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the temperate rice-growing region. In this study, ASD7 harboring a BPH resistance gene bph2 was crossed to a susceptible cultivar C418, a japonica restorer line. BPH resistance was evaluated using 134 F2:3 lines derived from the cross between "ASD7" and "C418". SSR assay and linkage analysis were carried out to detect bph2. As a result, the resistant gene bph2 in ASD7 was successfully mapped between RM7102 and RM463 on the long arm of chromosome 12, with distances of 7.6 cM and 7.2 cM, respectively. Meanwhile, both phenotypic selection and marker-assisted selection (MAS) were conducted in the BC1F1 and BC2F1 populations. Selection efficiencies of RM7102 and RM463 were determined to be 89.9% and 91.2%, respectively. It would be very beneficial for BPH resistance improvement by using MAS of this gene.
16912923	A metallothionein-like protein of rice (rgMT) functions in E. coli and its gene expression is induced by abiotic stresses.	2006	Biotechnol Lett	A metallothionein-like (rgMT) gene was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) root cDNA library that was prepared from plants grown under NaHCO3 stress. The rgMT gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several abiotic stresses from salts (NaCl and NaHCO3), drought (PEG) and metals (CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2). The results suggested that the rgMT gene was expressed in response to environmental stresses. The rgMT gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the final yield of the purified rgMT protein was 4.8 mg g(-1) dry cells. Tolerance of E. coli expressing GST-rgMT fusion protein to Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ was enhanced, and cells dry weight increased 0.04 mg, 0.17 mg and 0.07 mg in 1 ml culture treated with either CuCl2, ZnCl2 or CdCl2, respectively, compared with control after 6 h culture.
16670901	Investigation of the endosperm-specific sucrose synthase promoter from rice using transient expression of reporter genes in guar seed tissue.	2006	Plant Cell Rep	We report the investigation of an endosperm-specific promoter from the rsus3 gene from rice (Oryza sativa). The promoter was characterized by deletion analysis and transient expression in guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) seed-tissue. Transient expression was monitored by histochemical GUS assay, and quantitative dual reporter assays comprising firefly luciferase as a test reporter, and Renilla luciferase and GUS as reference reporters. These revealed high expression levels of the reporter genes directed by the rsus3 promoter in guar endosperm. Specificity for this tissue in seeds was apparent from a virtual absence of reporter activity in guar cotyledons. Removal of a putative intron region only slightly raised the expression level, whereas duplication of the minimal promoter region, in a tandem-repeat rsus3 promoter construct, retained endosperm specificity in guar, and displayed three times the reporter activity observed with the single copy construct.
16553215	SSR mapping of brown planthopper resistance gene Bph9 in Kaharamana, an Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	The brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most serious insects pests of rice, and the host resistance has been recognized as one of the most economic and effective measures for BPH management. In this study, we conducted a molecular-based genetic analysis of Bph9 in Kaharamana, a Sri Lanka rice variety resistant to BPH insects of East and Southeast Asia. An F2 segregating population composed of 180 plants was constructed from the cross between Kaharamana and 02428, and each F2 plant was self-crossed to obtain F2:3 family. The bulked seedling test method was used to evaluate the resistance of F2:3 families, and the genotype of each F2 plant was inferred from the phenotype of corresponding F2:3 family. Linkage analysis indicated that the resistant gene Bph9 in Kaharamana was located between SSR markers RM463 and RM5341 on chromosome 12 with linkage distances of 6.8 cM and 9.7 cM, respectively. The time- and money-saving SSR markers would be helpful in the application of Bph9 in breeding program via marker-assisted selection.
16540337	Evidence for PSII donor-side damage and photoinhibition induced by cadmium treatment on rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	J Photochem Photobiol B	The effects of cadmium (from 7.5 to 75 microM) on chloroplasts of rice were studied at the structural and biochemical level. Loss of pigments, reduction of thylakoids and decrease in oxygen evolution and Fv/Fm ratio occur in leaves following cadmium treatment. However, the amount of photosystem II reaction center proteins and that of its light harvesting complex is not affected, indicating that cadmium does not adversely influence the structural organization of this photosystem. In thylakoids isolated from cadmium-treated plants a loss in the capability to reduce 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol is observed, which is partially restored if diphenylcarbazide is used as an electron donor, indicating that cadmium affects water splitting activity. In thylakoids isolated from control plants and treated with cadmium, diphenylcarbazide preserves most of the photosystem II activity lost after incubation with cadmium; most of the S(2) multiline electron paramagnetic resonance signal from the manganese cluster is lost, whereas the TyrD(+) and other signals are retained. Light-induced photosystem II damage, in vitro, is promoted by Cd-treatment as deduced from the mobility shift of the D1 protein observed by immunoblot.
16511358	The rice FON1 gene controls vegetative and reproductive development by regulating shoot apical meristem size.	2006	Mol Cells	Most plant organs develop from meristems. Rice FON1, which is an ortholog of Clv1, regulates stem cell proliferation and organ initiation. The point muta-tions, fon1-1 and fon1-2, disrupt meristem balance, resulting in alteration of floral organ numbers and the architecture of primary rachis branches. In this study, we identified two knockout alleles, fon1-3 and fon1-4, generated by T-DNA and Tos17 insertion, respectively. Unlike the previously isolated point mutants, the null mutants have alterations not only of the reproductive organs but also of vegetative tissues, producing fewer tillers and secondary rachis branches. The mutant plants are semi-dwarfs due to delayed leaf emergence, and leaf senescence is delayed. SEM analysis showed that the shoot apical meristems of fon1-3 mutants are enlarged. These results indicate that FON1 controls vegetative as well as reproductive development by regulating meristem size.
17335506	Early and specific gene expression triggered by rice resistance gene Pi33 in response to infection by ACE1 avirulent blast fungus.	2007	New Phytol	* Our view of genes involved in rice disease resistance is far from complete. Here we used a gene-for-gene relationship corresponding to the interaction between atypical avirulence gene ACE1 from Magnaporthe grisea and rice resistance gene Pi33 to better characterize early rice defence responses induced during such interaction. * Rice genes differentially expressed during early stages of Pi33/ACE1 interaction were identified using DNA chip-based differential hybridization and QRT-PCR survey of the expression of known and putative regulators of disease resistance. * One hundred genes were identified as induced or repressed during rice defence response, 80% of which are novel, including resistance gene analogues. Pi33/ACE1 interaction also triggered the up-regulation of classical PR defence genes and a massive down-regulation of chlorophyll a/b binding genes. Most of these differentially expressed genes were induced or repressed earlier in Pi33/ACE1 interaction than in the gene-for-gene interaction involving Nipponbare resistant cultivar. * Besides demonstrating that an ACE1/Pi33 interaction induced classical and specific expression patterns, this work provides a list of new genes likely to be involved in rice disease resistance.
17221232	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice.	2007	Planta	A full-length cDNA gene, designated Oryza sativa chymotrypsin inhibitor-like 1 (OCPI1), was characterized in rice. The predicted protein of OCPI1 shows very high sequence identity to reported chymotrypsin inhibitors from various plant species. Northern-blot analysis showed that the expression of OCPI1 was strongly induced by dehydration stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses. Interestingly, strong dehydration stress-induced GUS activity was also detected in the transgenic rice containing the reverse sequence of OCPI1 promoter fused to GUS gene, suggesting of a bidirectional transcriptional activity in the OCPI1 promoter. OCPI1 gene was over-expressed in japonica cv. Zhonghua 11 and transgenic plants containing single copy of transgene were tested for drought resistance at reproductive stage. The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected. Chymotrypsin-inhibitor activity assay showed that the crude protein of the positive transgenic plants had stronger inhibitory activity than the negative control. Transgenic plants had less decrease of total proteins than the wild type under drought stress. Taken together, these data indicate that OCPI1 might potentially be useful in the genetic improvement of drought resistance in rice.
17549514	Fine mapping of S31, a gene responsible for hybrid embryo-sac abortion in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Planta	Partial abortion of female gametes and the resulting semi-sterility of indica x japonica inter-subspecific rice hybrids have been ascribed to an allelic interaction, which can be avoided by the use of wide compatibility varieties. To further understand the genetic mechanism of hybrid sterility, we have constructed two sets of hybrids, using as male parent either the typical japonica variety Asominori, or the wide compatibility variety 02428; and as female, a set of 66 chromosome segment substitution lines in which various chromosomal segments from the indica variety IR24 have been introduced into a common genetic background of Asominori. Spikelet semi-sterility was observed in hybrid between CSSL34 and Asominori, which is known to carry the sterility gene S31 (Zhao et al. in Euphytica 151:331-337, 2006). Cytological analysis revealed that the semi-sterility of the CSSL34 x Asominori hybrid was caused primarily by partial abortion of the embryo sac at the stage of the mitosis of the functional megaspore. A population of 1,630 progeny of the three-way cross (CSSL34 x 02428) x Asominori was developed to map S31. Based on the physical location of linked molecular markers, S31 was thereby delimited to a 54-kb region on rice chromsome 5. This fragment contains eight predicted open reading frames, four of which encode known proteins and four putative proteins. These results are relevant to the map-based cloning of S31, and the development of marker-assisted transfer of non-sterility allele inducing alleles to breeding germplasm, to allow for a more efficient exploitation of heterosis in hybrid rice.
18943579	Genetic and physical mapping of the partial resistance gene, pi34, to blast in rice.	2007	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Partial resistance to rice blast in the Oryza sativa japonica group cv. Chubu 32 is controlled by Pi34, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 11, and several uncharacterized QTLs. The objectives of the study were (i) high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of Pi34 and (ii) identification of new QTL imparting resistance to rice blast. Chubu 32 was crossed with a susceptible chromosomal segment substitution line (CSSL) of cv. Koshihikari. From 4,012 of segregating individuals, 213 recombinants in the Pi34 region were screened by using polymerase chain reaction-based markers and tested resistance in the field and greenhouse. The Pi34 locus is located in the 54.1-kb region on the genomic sequence of cv. Nipponbare. We constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of Chubu 32, selected the clone containing Pi34, and sequenced it. The Pi34 locus consequently was located on an interval of 65.3 kb containing 10 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Two of these ORFs were predicted only in Chubu 32 and encoded transposable elements. The other eight ORFs were found in both Chubu 32 and Nipponbare and one of them, which encoded an unknown protein, showed significantly different amino acid sequences between two cultivars. The new QTL, Piq6(t), was detected on the short arm of chromosome 6 and the genetic distance of flanking markers was 16.9 centimorgans in Nipponbare. Pi34 and Piq6(t) acted additively on resistance to rice blast but the effect of Piq6(t) was relatively small compared with Pi34.
18317774	Construction of the physical map of the gpa7 locus reveals that a large segment was deleted during rice domestication.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	To facilitate cloning gene(s) underlying gpa7, a deep-coverage BAC library was constructed for an isolate of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) collected from Dongxiang, Jiangxi Province, China (DXCWR). gpa7, a quantitative trait locus corresponding to grain number per panicle, is positioned in the short arm of chromosome 7. The BAC library containing 96,768 clones represents approximate 18 haploid genome equivalents. The contig spanning DXCWR gpa7 was constructed with a series of ordered markers. The putative physical map near the gpa7 locus of another accession of O. rufipogon (Accession: IRGC 105491) was also isolated in silico. Analysis of the physical maps of gpa7 indicated that a segment of about 150 kb was deleted during domestication of common wild rice.
18560761	Functions and transport of silicon in plants.	2008	Cell Mol Life Sci	Silicon exerts beneficial effects on plant growth and production by alleviating both biotic and abiotic stresses including diseases, pests, lodging, drought, and nutrient imbalance. Recently, two genes (Lsi1 and Lsi2) encoding Si transporters have been identified from rice. Lsi1 (low silicon 1) belongs to a Nod26-like major intrinsic protein subfamily in aquaporin, while Lsi2 encodes a putative anion transporter. Lsi1 is localized on the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis in rice roots, while Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Lsi1 shows influx transport activity for Si, while Lsi2 shows efflux transport activity. Therefore, Lsi1 is responsible for transport of Si from the external solution to the root cells, whereas Lsi2 is an efflux transporter responsible for the transport of Si from the root cells to the apoplast. Coupling of Lsi1 with Lsi2 is required for efficient uptake of Si in rice.
16033806	Identification of 33 rice aquaporin genes and analysis of their expression and function.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant aquaporins form a large protein family including plasma membrane-type (PIPs) and tonoplast-type aquaporins (TIPs), and facilitate osmotic water transport across membranes as a key physiological function. We identified 33 genes for aquaporins in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). We investigated their expression levels in leaf blades, roots and anthers of rice (cv. Akitakomachi) using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). At both early tillering (21 d after germination) and panicle formation (56 d) stages, six genes, including OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5, were expressed predominantly in roots, while 14 genes, including OsPIP2;7 and OsTIP1;2, were found in leaf blades. Eight genes, such as OsPIP1;1 and OsTIP4;1, were evenly expressed in leaf blades, roots and anthers. Analysis by stopped-flow spectrophotometry revealed high water channel activity when OsPIP2;4 or OsPIP2;5 were expressed in yeast but not when OsPIP1;1 or OsPIP1;2 were expressed. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5 showed a clear diurnal fluctuation in roots; they showed a peak 3 h after the onset of light and dropped to a minimum 3 h after the onset of darkness. The mRNA levels of 10 genes including OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5 markedly decreased in roots during chilling treatment and recovered after warming. The changes in mRNA levels during and after the chilling treatment were comparable with that of the bleeding sap volume. These results suggested the relationship between the root water uptake and mRNA levels of several aquaporins with high water channel activity, such as OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5.
19020855	Fine mapping of the grain chalkiness QTL qPGWC-7 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Chalkiness of rice grain is an important quality component of rice, as it has a profound influence on eating and milling qualities. We has determined the inheritance of percentage of grain with chalkiness (PGWC) using a set of chromosome segment substitution lines, made from a cross between cv. PA64s and cv. 9311. Two loci controlling PGWC, designated as qPGWC-6 and qPGWC-7, were located on, respectively, chromosomes 6 and 7. Comparisons were made between C-51 (a CSSL harbouring qPGWC-7 and having a chalky endosperm) and the recurrent parent 9311 (translucent endosperm) to characterize the physical and chemical differences between translucent and chalky endosperm. Unlike the translucent endosperm, the chalky endosperm contains loosely packed starch granules, and there were significant difference between C-51 and 9311 for amylopectin structure and degree of crystallinity, but not for either amylose content or starch viscosity. Segregation analysis of the F2 population from the cross between C-51 and 9311 showed PGWC is a semi-dominant trait, controlled by single nuclear gene. A large F2 population was constructed from the cross C51x9311, and used for the fine mapping of qPGWC-7, which was located to a 44-kb DNA fragment, containing thirteen predicted genes. This result provides a springboard for the map-based cloning of qPGWC-7 and allowed for marker-assisted selection for endosperm texture.
19760367	Identification and characterization of a novel Waxy allele from a Yunnan rice landrace.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Low amylose content (AC) is a desirable trait for rice (Oryza sativa L.) cooking quality and is selected in soft rice breeding. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling AC formation, we screened 83 Yunnan rice landraces in China and identified a rice variety, Haopi, with low AC. Genetic analyses and transgenic experiments revealed that low AC in Haopi was controlled by a novel allele of the Wx locus, Wx(hp), encoding a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI). Sequence comparisons of Wx(hp) and Wx(b) alleles (from Nipponbare) showed several nucleotide changes in the upstream regulatory regions (including the promoter, 5'-untranslated region, and first intron 5' splicing junction site). Interestingly, these changes had no obvious effect on the expression level and splicing efficiency of Wx transcripts. In addition, an examination of the coding region revealed that the Wx(hp) allele carries an A-to-G change at nucleotide position +497 from the start codon, resulting in an Asp(165)/Gly(165) substitution. The amino acid substitution had no detectable effects on GBSSI activity in vitro; however, it notably reduced the binding of GBSSI to starch granules, resulting in a reduction of AC in rice seeds. Moreover, three other Yunnan landraces with low AC also carry a nucleotide substitution identical to Haopi at the +497 position of the Wx gene, suggesting common ancestry. Based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism, we have developed a new derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker for use in breeding practice to manipulate AC in rice endosperm.
16117852	Fine mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of a low glutelin content gene in rice.	2005	Cell Res	Rice with low glutelin content is suitable as functional food for patients affected with diabetes and kidney failure. The fine mapping of the gene(s) responsible for low glutelin content will provide information regarding the distribution of glutelin related genes in rice genome and will generate markers for the selection of low glutelin rice varieties. Following an SDS-PAGE screen of rice germplasm from Taihu Valley of China, Japonica selection W3660 is identified to be a novel mutant characterized with low glutelin content. For fine mapping the mutant gene for low glutelin content, F2 and F3 populations were derived from a cross between W3660 and Jingrennuo. SDS-PAGE analysis of the total endosperm protein showed that the low glutelin content trait was controlled by a single dominant nuclear gene. Genetic mapping, using SSRs, located this gene to chromosome 2, in the region between SSR2-001/SSR2-004 and RM1358. The distances of the two markers to the target gene were 1.1 cM and 3.8 cM respectively. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the transcripts of GluB4/GluB5 genes located within the region do not change. However, GluB5 gene located proximal to SSR2-001/SSR2-004 was specifically reduced. SSR profiles of seven Japonica varieties were compared with that of W3660 for loci in the relevant genetic region. The markers SSR2-004 and RM1358 were used for marker-assisted selection. The selection efficiencies of SSR2-004 and RM1358 were 96.8% and 92.7% respectively. This provides a standard starting point for the breeding of low glutelin content rice varieties in China.
16183700	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	That plant dwarfism is caused by hormonal defects related to gibberellin and brassinosteroid has been well documented. Other contributing elements, however, have not been elucidated. Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1). Most mutant plants died within 1 month after sowing, but a few (5.2%) survived and grew. Vacuolation enlarged cells in the leaf primordia and seminal root before abortion, which disrupted the organized cell files in these organs. Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal. Similarly, initiation and organogenesis of the leaf primordia at the shoot apical meristem and those of the lateral root primordia at the root elongation zone occurred normally. These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis. Positional cloning of DBS1 revealed that it encoded a NACK-type kinesin-like protein (OsNACK), homologous to the essential components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during plant cytokinesis. A BLAST search indicated that DBS1 was the only gene encoding the OsNACK-type protein in the rice genome, and the dbs1 mutant produced only small amounts of the translatable DBS1 mRNA. Thus, we conclude that the dbs1 mutation causes a severe defect in DBS1 function but does not completely shut it down. We discuss the leaky phenotype of dbs1 under the restricted functioning of OsNACK.
19693083	The ethylene response factors SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 allow rice to adapt to deep water.	2009	Nature	Living organisms must acquire new biological functions to adapt to changing and hostile environments. Deepwater rice has evolved and adapted to flooding by acquiring the ability to significantly elongate its internodes, which have hollow structures and function as snorkels to allow gas exchange with the atmosphere, and thus prevent drowning. Many physiological studies have shown that the phytohormones ethylene, gibberellin and abscisic acid are involved in this response, but the gene(s) responsible for this trait has not been identified. Here we show the molecular mechanism of deepwater response through the identification of the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2, which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved in ethylene signalling. Under deepwater conditions, ethylene accumulates in the plant and induces expression of these two genes. The products of SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 then trigger remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin. We also demonstrate that the introduction of three quantitative trait loci from deepwater rice into non-deepwater rice enabled the latter to become deepwater rice. This discovery will contribute to rice breeding in lowland areas that are frequently flooded during the rainy season.
16147864	Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid.	2005	DNA Seq	A C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP245 was cloned by RT-PCR approach from cold treated rice seedlings. ZFP245 is 712 bp in length and encodes a 24.5 KDa protein, which has 35% identity in amino acid with SCOF-1, a cold-inducible zinc finger protein from soybean. By database search, ZFP245 was mapped on chromosome 7 and clustered together with another C2H2 zinc finger gene. Tissue expression analysis showed that ZFP245 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues including roots, stems, leaves and spikes. The semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assay revealed ZFP245 was strongly induced after 6 h exposure to cold and drought stresses, and then reduced to the baseline. However, ZFP245 was not regulated by high salt or abscisic acid treatment. The promoter sequence of 1017 nucleotides, upstream of ZFP245, was cloned directly by PCR approach. Sequence analysis revealed a CRT/DRE element was found within the ZFP245 promoter region. Taken together, ZFP245, as the first identified C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in stress response in monocots probably plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant cold and drought responses through an ABA-independent pathway.
19135985	Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) transcription factors play diverse roles in plant development and stress responses. In this study, a rice NAC gene, ONAC045, was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in abiotic stress resistance. Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots. Transcriptional activation assay in yeast indicated that ONAC045 functioned as a transcriptional activator. Transient expression of GFP-ONAC045 in onion epidermal cells revealed that ONAC045 protein was localized in the nucleus. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments. Two stress-responsive genes were upregulated in transgenic rice. Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice.
19135278	Expression analysis of nine rice heat shock protein genes under abiotic stresses and ABA treatment.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Expression profiles of nine rice heat shock protein genes (OsHSPs) were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nine genes exhibited distinctive expression in different organs. Expression of nine OsHSP genes was affected differentially by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). All nine OsHSP genes were induced strongly by heat shock treatment, whereas none of them were induced by cold. The transcripts of OsHSP80.2, OsHSP71.1 and OsHSP23.7 were increased during salt tress treatment. Expression of OsHSP80.2 and OsHSP24.1 genes were enhanced while treated with 10% PEG. Only OsHSP71.1 was induced by ABA while OsHSP24.1 was suppressed by ABA. These observations imply that the nine OsHSP genes may play different roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses.
19132872	Constitutive expression of OsGH3.1 reduces auxin content and enhances defense response and resistance to a fungal pathogen in rice.	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	GH3 genes are main components of the hormonal mechanism regulating growth and development and, hence, are deeply involved in a broad range of physiological processes. They are implicated in hormonal homeostasis through the conjugation to amino acids of the free form of essential plant growth regulators such as indoleacetic and jasmonic acids. In this work, we showed that OsGH3.1 overexpression in rice caused dwarfism and significantly reduced both free auxin content and cell elongation. Functional classification of the transcriptomic profiling revealed that most genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling inhibition were induced and repressed, respectively. Many genes related to cell organization and biogenesis were also significantly downregulated. The survey also showed that, although the response to abiotic stresses was not clearly stimulated, OsGH3.1 overexpression did activate a significant number of defense-related genes. In successive bioassays, it was demonstrated that the resistance of rice plants to pathogen infection, evaluated with two different Magnaporthe grisea strains, was higher in the transformants overexpressing OsGH3.1. Taken together, these results indicate that OsGH3.1 overexpression reduces auxin content, inhibits cell growth and cell wall loosening, and enhances resistance to a fungal pathogen. Our results provide evidence that auxin homeostasis can regulate the activation of the defense response in rice.
19123010	Characterization of autonomous Dart1 transposons belonging to the hAT superfamily in rice.	2009	Mol Genet Genomics	An endogenous 0.6-kb rice DNA transposon, nDart1-0, was found as an active nonautonomous element in a mutable virescent line, pyl-v, displaying leaf variegations. Here, we demonstrated that the active autonomous element aDart in pyl-v corresponds to Dart1-27 on chromosome 6 in Nipponbare, which carries no active aDart elements, and that aDart and Dart1-27 are identical in their sequences and chromosomal locations, indicating that Dart1-27 is epigenetically silenced in Nipponbare. The identification of aDart in pyl-v was first performed by map-based cloning and by detection of the accumulated transposase transcripts. Subsequently, various transposition activities of the cloned Dart1-27 element from Nipponbare were demonstrated in Arabidopsis. Dart1-27 in Arabidopsis was able to excise nDart1-0 and Dart1-27 from cloned sites, generating footprints, and to integrate into new sites, generating 8-bp target site duplications. In addition to Dart1-27, Nipponbare contains 37 putative autonomous Dart1 elements because their putative transposase genes carry no apparent nonsense or frameshift mutations. Of these, at least four elements were shown to become active aDart elements in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, even though considerable sequence divergence arose among their transposases. Thus, these four Dart1 elements and Dart1-27 in Nipponbare must be potential autonomous elements silenced epigenetically. The regulatory and evolutionary implications of the autonomous Dart1 elements and the development of an efficient transposon-tagging system in rice are discussed.
19123004	Overexpressed glutamine synthetase gene modifies nitrogen metabolism and abiotic stress responses in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) is a key enzyme in nitrogen metabolism; it catalyzes the critical incorporation of inorganic ammonium into glutamine. Two full-length cDNAs that encode the rice (Oryza sativa) cytosolic glutamine synthetase1 genes (OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2) were isolated from a Minghui 63 normalized cDNA library, and glnA encoding GS in Escherichia coli was isolated by PCR amplification. Transformants for GS gene (GS1;1, GS1;2, and glnA) in rice were produced by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method, and transcripts of GS gene accumulated at higher levels in the primary transgenic plants. Our results indicated an increased metabolic level in GS-overexpressed plants, which showed higher total GS activities and soluble protein concentrations in leaves and higher total amino acids and total nitrogen content in the whole plant. Decreases in both grain yield production and total amino acids were observed in seeds of GS-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type plants. In addition, GS1;2-overexpressed plants exhibited resistance to Basta selection and higher sensitivity to salt, drought, and cold stress conditions, whereas the other two types of GS-overexpressed plants failed to show any significant changes for these stress conditions compared with wild-type plants.
19118651	Differential proteomic analysis of soluble extracellular proteins reveals the cysteine protease and cystatin involved in suspension-cultured cell proliferation in rice.	2009	Biochim Biophys Acta	Extracellular matrix proteins play crucial roles in plant development, morphogenesis, cell division, and proliferation. To identify extracellular proteins that regulate cell growth, the soluble proteins of extracellular matrix were extracted from suspension-cultured rice cells for different lengths of time. The extract obtained from 3-d cultures was found to increase cells' fresh weight, while extracts from 6-d and 9-d cultures showed no effect on cells' growth. A comparative proteomic analysis was used to identify soluble extracellular proteins differentially expressed between 3 and 6 days in suspension-cultured cells. Ten unique protein spots were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Among them, included a cysteine protease (OsCP) and a putative cysteine protease inhibitor (cystatin, OC-I). OsCP has been down regulated in vivo using RNAi transgenic lines. The fresh and dry weight growth rates of OsCP RNAi cell lines were lower than empty vector control. Recombinant protein of OC-I could inhibit the OsCP protease activity, also it could inhibit the weight increase of suspension-culture cell as well as extracellular protease activity. These results suggest that OsCP and OC-I may be involved in the process of suspension-cultured rice cells proliferation.
19116760	FLEXIBLE CULM 1 encoding a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase controls culm mechanical strength in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Culm mechanical strength is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding. To understand the molecular mechanisms that control culm mechanical strength, we identified a flexible culm1 (fc1) mutant by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library. This mutant exhibited an abnormal development phenotype, including late heading time, semi-dwarf habit, and flexible culm. In this study, we cloned the FLEXIBLE CULM1 (FC1) gene in rice using a T-DNA tagging approach. FC1 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase and is mainly expressed in the sclerenchyma cells of the secondary cell wall and vascular bundle region. In these types of cells, a deficiency of FC1 in the fc1 mutant caused a reduction in cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in lignin. Extracts from the first internodes and panicles of the fc1 plants exhibited drastically reduced cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Further histological and biochemical analyses revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl monomers in fc1 cell wall were reduced greatly. Our results indicated that FC1 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of lignin and the control of culm strength in rice.
19116133	Rice OsSIPK and its orthologs: a "central master switch" for stress responses.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a central role in controlling a vast array of plant biochemical and physiological processes. It is regulated by a characteristic phosphorelay system in which a series of three kinases phosphorylate and activate each other. Over the past years, several plants MAPKs have been identified and characterized. Of these, rice OsSIPK (Salicylic acid (SA)-Induced Protein Kinase) and its orthologs in other plants are of particular interest. A large body of evidence demonstrates the involvement of SIPKs in fine-tuned regulation of the plant responses to ozone, wounding, SA, and jasmonic acid (JA). Interestingly, their function appears to be conserved across reference plants, such as rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. In this minireview, we discuss the recent progress on rice OsSIPK and its orthologs as a "central master switch" for mediating plant responses against ozone, wounding, and JA as examples.
19103168	Differential regulation of proteins and phosphoproteins in rice under drought stress.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Drought is the largest constraint on rice production in Asia. Protein phosphorylation has been recognized as an important mechanism for environmental stress signaling. However, the differential expression of proteins and phosphoproteins induced by drought in rice is still largely unknown. In this paper, we report the identification of differentially expressed proteins and phosphoproteins induced by drought in rice using proteomic approaches. Three drought-responsive proteins were identified. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like protein and chloroplast Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) were up-regulated by drought whereas Rieske Fe-S precursor protein was down-regulated. Ten drought-responsive phosphoproteins were identified: NAD-malate dehydrogenase, OSJNBa0084K20.14 protein, abscisic acid- and stress-inducible protein, ribosomal protein, drought-induced S-like ribonuclease, ethylene-inducible protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta subunit-like protein, r40c1 protein, OSJNBb0039L24.13 protein and germin-like protein 1. Seven of these phosphoproteins have not previously been reported to be involved in rice drought stress. These results provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of drought-induced proteins and implicate several previously unrecognized proteins in response to drought stress.
19098326	Role of the aquaporin PIP1 subfamily in the chilling tolerance of rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Although an association between chilling tolerance and aquaporins has been reported, the exact mechanisms involved in this relationship remain unclear. We compared the expression profiles of aquaporin genes between a chilling-tolerant and a low temperature-sensitive rice variety using real-time PCR and identified seven genes that closely correlated with chilling tolerance. Chemical treatment experiments, by which rice plants were induced to lose their chilling tolerance, implicated the PIP1 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1) subfamily member genes in chilling tolerance. Of these members, changes in expression of the OsPIP1;3 gene suggested this to be the most closely related to chilling tolerance. Although OsPIP1;3 showed a much lower water permeability than members of the OsPIP2 family, OsPIP1;3 enhanced the water permeability of OsPIP2;2 and OsPIP2;4 when co-expressed with either of these proteins in oocytes. Transgenic rice plants (OE1) overexpressing OsPIP1;3 showed an enhanced level of chilling tolerance and the ability to maintain high OsPIP1;3 expression levels under low temperature treatment, similar to that of chilling-tolerant rice plants. We assume that OsPIP1;3, constitutively overexpressed in the leaf and root of transgenic OE1 plants, interacts with members of the OsPIP2 subfamily, thereby improving the plants' water balance under low temperatures and resulting in the observed chilling tolerance of the plants.
19089317	Rice phot1a mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	The aim of this work was to characterize the phot1 mutant of rice during early seedling growth in various light conditions. We isolated the rice T-DNA insertion mutant phot1a-1 and compared it to the Tos17 insertion mutant phot1a-2. When phot1a mutants were grown under WL (100) and BL (40 miccromol m(-2) s(-1)), they demonstrated a considerable reduction in photosynthetic capacity, which included decreased leaf CO(2) uptake and plant growth. Pigment analysis showed no significant difference between wild-type and mutants in the Chl a:b ratios, whereas in the latter, total concentration was reduced (a 2-fold decrease). Carotenoid contents of the mutants were also decreased considerably, implying the involvement of phot1a in pigment degradation. Deletion of phot1a showed higher contents of H(2)O(2) in leaves. Chloroplastic APX and SOD activities were lower in the mutants whereas the activities of cytosolic enzymes were increased. Immunoblotting indicated reduced accumulation of photosystem proteins (D1, D2, CP43, Lhca2, and PsaC) relative to the other light-harvesting complexes in the mutant. We conclude that the defect of Os Phot1a affects degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids, and under photosynthetically active photon fluxes, mutation of phot1a results in loss of photosynthetic capacity owing to the damage of photosystems caused by elevated H(2)O(2) accumulation, leading to a reduction in plant growth.
19086295	Constitutive expression of a rice GTPase-activating protein induces defense responses.	2008	New Phytol	G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that usually exhibit GTPase activities) and related signal transduction processes play important roles in mediating plant defense responses; here, a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA clone, OsGAP1, encoding a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that also contains a protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain is reported. An interacting G-protein partner for the OsGAP1 protein was identified by yeast two-hybrid library screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation; the GTPase-activation activity of OsGAP1 on this interacting G-protein was demonstrated using in vitro assays. OsGAP1 was induced by wounding in rice and the presence of the R locus Xa14 enhances such induction. Gain-of-function tests in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana showed that constitutive expression of OsGAP1 led to increased resistance to bacterial pathogens in both monocots and dicots.
19054337	An anther-specific dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like gene (DRL1) is essential for male fertility in Arabidopsis.	2009	New Phytol	Arabidopsis contains only one functional dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) gene, but several DFR-like genes encoding proteins with the conserved NAD(P)H binding domain. At4g35420, named DRL1 (Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like1), is a closely related homolog of the rice anther-specific gene OsDFR2 reported previously. Two T-DNA mutants (drl1-1 and drl1-2) were found to have impaired pollen formation and seed production. Histological analysis revealed defective microspore development after tetrad release in both mutants. Microspore walls were found to rupture, releasing the protoplasts which eventually degenerated. The DRL1 promoter is anther-specific in closed flower buds. Promoter-GUS analysis in transgenic Arabidopsis revealed expression in tapetum, tetrads, and developing microspores, but not in mature anthers. Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-localization analysis demonstrated that DRL1 is a soluble cytosolic protein that may also be localized in the nucleus. Restoration of male fertility and seed formation was only achieved by a native promoter-DRL1 construct, but not by a 35S-DRL1 construct, demonstrating the importance of spatial and temporal specificities of DRL1 expression. DRL1 may be involved in a novel metabolic pathway essential for pollen wall development. DRL1 homologs were identified as anther- and floral-specific expressed sequence tags from different species, suggesting that DRL1 may have a conserved functional role in male fertility in flowering plants.
19048288	Identification of OsbZIP72 as a positive regulator of ABA response and drought tolerance in rice.	2009	Planta	Abscisic Acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone involved in abiotic stress resistance in plants. A group of bZIP transcription factors play important roles in the ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about the function of their orthologs in rice, where they may hold a great potential for developing drought resistant food crops. In this study, our phylogenetic analysis showed that this group of bZIPs was evolutionarily conserved between Arabidopsis and rice, which implies that they may share similar functions. We demonstrated with quantitative RT-PCR that the expressions of most of these OsbZIPs were significantly induced by ABA, ACC, and abiotic stresses. OsbZIP72, a member of this group, was proved to be an ABRE binding factor in rice using the yeast hybrid systems. We showed that it could bind to ABRE and transactivate the downstream reporter genes in yeast, and the transactivity was depending on its N-terminal region. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP72 showed a hypersensitivity to ABA, elevated levels of expression of ABA response gene such as LEAs, and an enhanced ability of drought tolerance. These results suggest that OsbZIP72 plays a positive role in drought resistance through ABA signaling, and is potential useful for engineering drought tolerant rice.
19047499	Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice.	2009	J Exp Bot	The plasma membrane (PM) proton pump ATPases (H(+)-ATPases) are involved in almost all aspects of biology. They are plant specific and several members of this family are supposed to play a key role in nutrient acquisition. At present, only some members of this gene family in plants have been characterized. However, no nutrient uptake associated H(+)-ATPase gene in rice has been functionally analysed. It is reported here that OsA8, a typical PM H(+)-ATPases gene that was predominantly expressed in roots of rice, is down-regulated by nutrient deficiency. The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions. Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots. These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice.
19039666	A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Wall-associated protein kinases (WAKs) are a new group of receptor-like kinases (RLK) recently identified in Arabidopsis. A cDNA encoding a novel WAK was isolated from rice and was named OsWAK1 (Oryza sativa WAK). The deduced amino acid sequence of OsWAK1 showed 27.6% identity to WAK2 from Arabidopsis. OsWAK1 not only has the ability of autophosphorylation but also can phosphorylate OsRFP1, a putative transcription regulator recently identified in rice. OsRFP1 strongly interacts with the kinase domain of OsWAK1. This demonstrated that OsWAK1 is a functional protein kinase. A fusion protein of OsWAK1 with GFP was found to be localized on the cell surface. Plasmolysis experiments further revealed OsWAK1 is associated with the cell wall. Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the OsWAK1 transcripts, and the accumulation of OsWAK1 mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus. OsWAK1 was also induced after treatment by mechanical wounding, SA and MeJA, but not by ABA. These results imply that OsWAK1 is a novel gene involved in plant defense. Furthermore, six transgenic rice lines with constitutive expression of OsWAK1 became resistant to the compatible race. However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions. This provides functional evidence that induction of OsWAK1 as a novel RLK plays important roles in plant disease resistance.
19036832	Identification of an apoplastic protein involved in the initial phase of salt stress response in rice root by two-dimensional electrophoresis.	2009	Plant Physiol	The apoplast of plant cells, which carries out multiple functions in plant metabolism and signaling, is not only a barrier but also the linker between the environment and the protoplast. To investigate the role of apoplastic proteins in the salt stress response, 10-d-old rice (Oryza sativa) plants were treated with 200 mM NaCl for 1, 3, or 6 h, and the soluble apoplast proteins were extracted for differential analysis compared with untreated controls using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Ten protein spots that increased or decreased significantly in abundance were identified by mass spectrometry. These proteins included some well-known biotic and abiotic stress-related proteins. Among them, an apoplastic protein, with extracellular domain-like cysteine-rich motifs (DUF26), O. sativa root meander curling (OsRMC), has shown drastically increased abundance in response to salt stress during the initial phase. OsRMC RNA interference transgenic rice has been generated to assess the function of OsRMC in the salt stress response. The results show that knocking down the expression level of OsRMC in transgenic rice led to insensitive seed germination, enhanced growth inhibition, and improved salt stress tolerance to NaCl than in untransgenic plants. These results indicate that plant apoplastic proteins may have important roles in the plant salt stress response.
19011004	OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter required for efficient translocation of iron in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters represent a large family in plants, but their functions are poorly understood. Here, we report the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) MATE gene (Os03g0216700, OsFRDL1), the closest homolog of barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvAACT1 (aluminum [Al]-activated citrate transporter 1), in terms of metal stress (iron [Fe] deficiency and Al toxicity). This gene was mainly expressed in the roots and the expression level was not affected by either Fe deficiency or Al toxicity. Knockout of this gene resulted in leaf chlorosis, lower leaf Fe concentration, higher accumulation of zinc and manganese concentration in the leaves, and precipitation of Fe in the root's stele. The concentration of citrate and ferric iron in the xylem sap was lower in the knockout line compared to the wild-type rice. Heterologous expression of OsFRDL1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for citrate. Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL1 was localized at the pericycle cells of the roots. On the other hand, there was no difference in the Al-induced secretion of citrate from the roots between the knockout line and the wild-type rice. Taken together, our results indicate that OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter localized at the pericycle cells, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Fe to the shoot as a Fe-citrate complex.
19010999	Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors.	2009	Plant Physiol	The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hexokinase 1 (AtHXK1) is recognized as an important glucose (Glc) sensor. However, the function of hexokinases as Glc sensors has not been clearly demonstrated in other plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa). To investigate the functions of rice hexokinase isoforms, we characterized OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, which are evolutionarily related to AtHXK1. Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria. Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol. In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei. In transient expression assays using promoterluciferase fusion constructs, these two OsHXKs and their catalytically inactive alleles dramatically enhanced the Glc-dependent repression of the maize (Zea mays) Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) and rice alpha-amylase genes in mesophyll protoplasts of maize and rice. Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment. These results provide evidence that rice OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as Glc sensors.
19000161	Involvement of OsSPX1 in phosphate homeostasis in rice.	2009	Plant J	Arabidopsis thaliana SPX (SYG/PHO81/XPR1) domain genes have recently been shown to be involved in the phosphate (Pi) signaling pathway. We show here that a rice (Oryza sativa) SPX gene, OsSPX1, is specifically induced by Pi starvation in roots. Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over-accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate-responsive mutant 2). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2. The expression of 10 genes associated with the phosphate-starvation signal pathways was analyzed. Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport. In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8. This suggests that OsSPX1 acts via a negative feedback loop to optimize growth under phosphate-limited conditions.
18988636	Characterization of OsPIP2;7, a water channel protein in rice.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Aquaporins are water channel proteins that facilitate passage of water and other small neutral molecules across biological membranes. There are usually a large number of members of this family in higher plants, which exhibit various physiological functions and are regulated in a time-specific and particular mode. We have previously shown that a rice gene, OsPIP2;7, was generally up-regulated in roots but down-regulated in shoots at the early stage of chilling stress. Here, OsPIP2;7 was cloned and proved to be an aquaporin with high activity in Xenopus oocytes. OsPIP2;7 was localized mainly in mesophyll cells of leaves. In roots it was detected in the vascular tissues, epidermis cells and exodermis cells at the elongation zone, as well as in the epidermis cells, exodermis cells and root hair at the maturation zone. Yeast cells overexpressing OsPIP2;7 showed a higher survival rate after freeze-thaw stress. Furthermore, OsPIP2;7 enhanced the transpiration rate and tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice. These results indicated that OsPIP2;7 was involved in rapid water transport and maintenance of the water balance in cells, and ultimately improves the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress.
18986259	Analysis of flagellin perception mediated by flg22 receptor OsFLS2 in rice.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plants have sensitive perception systems that recognize various pathogen-derived molecules. We previously reported that rice detects flagellin from a rice-incompatible strain of gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium, Acidovorax avenae, which induces subsequent immune responses involving cell death. The mechanism of flagellin perception in rice, however, has remained obscure. In this study, we found that flg22, a peptide derived from the flagellin N-terminus, induced weak immune responses without cell death in cultured rice cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which flg22 induced signaling in rice, we characterized OsFLS2, the rice ortholog of AtFLS2, which mediates flg22 perception. Heterologous expression of OsFLS2 functions in Arabidopsis, showing the conservation of the flg22 signaling pathway across divergent plant taxa. OsFLS2-overexpressing rice cultured cells generated stronger immune responses with the induction of cell death following stimulation with flg22 and flagellin. However, examination of the growth rate of the compatible strain in inoculated OsFLS2-overexpressing rice could not confirm bacterial growth suppression compared with wild-type rice. These results suggest that rice possesses a conserved flagellin perception system utilizing the FLS2 receptor which, when upregulated, hardly affects resistance against compatible A. avenae.
18980953	Characterization of a new rice glutelin gene GluD-1 expressed in the starchy endosperm.	2008	J Exp Bot	A new glutelin gene, designated GluD-1, has been discovered by comparing the seed storage proteins from 48 japonica and indica rice cultivars on SDS-PAGE gels. Evidence that GluD-1 is a member of the glutelin family was provided by Western blots using anti-glutelin antiserum and by mapping the gene to the chromosomal glutelin gene cluster. The limited GluD-1 size polymorphism among the rice varieties is due to amino acid substitutions rather than to post-transcriptional modification. GluD-1 is maximally expressed in the starchy endosperm starting at 5 d after flowering (DAF) and increasing through 30 DAF, a major difference from the other glutelins which are primarily expressed in the subaleurone from 10-16 DAF. Only about 0.2 kb of the GluD-1 promoter was sufficient to confer inner starchy endosperm-specific expression. The 0.2 kb truncated GluD-1 promoter contains a bifactorial endosperm box consisting of a truncated GCN4 motif (TGA(G/C)TCA) and AAAG Prolamin box (P box), and ACGT and AACA motifs as cis-regulatory elements. Gel retardation assays and trans-activation experiments indicated that the truncated GCN4 and P box are specifically recognized by RISBZ1 b-ZIP and RPBF Dof activators in vitro, respectively, and are synergistically transactivated, indicating that combinatorial interactions of these motifs are involved in essential endosperm-specific regulation. Furthermore, deviation from the cognate GCN4 motif alters tissue-specific expression in the inner starchy endosperm to include other endosperm tissues.
18980660	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice.	2009	Plant J	Gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs), two growth-promoting phytohormones, regulate many common physiological processes. Their interactions at the molecular level remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that OsGSR1, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility. The OsGSR1 RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis. These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level. Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling. These results demonstrate that OsGSR1 plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways.
18980647	Two rice phosphate transporters, OsPht1;2 and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation.	2009	Plant J	Plant phosphate (Pi) transporters mediate the uptake and translocation of this nutrient within plants. A total of 13 sequences in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome can be identified as belonging to the Pi transporter (Pht1) family. Here, we report on the expression patterns, biological properties and the physiological roles of two members of the family: OsPht1;2 (OsPT2) and OsPht1;6 (OsPT6). Expression of both genes increased significantly under Pi deprivation in roots and shoots. By using transgenic rice plants expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by their promoters, we detected that OsPT2 was localized exclusively in the stele of primary and lateral roots, whereas OsPT6 was expressed in both epidermal and cortical cells of the younger primary and lateral roots. OsPT6, but not OsPT2, was able to complement a yeast Pi uptake mutant in the high-affinity concentration range. Xenopus oocytes injected with OsPT2 mRNA showed increased Pi accumulation and a Pi-elicited depolarization of the cell membrane electrical potential, when supplied with mM external concentrations. Both results show that OsPT2 mediated the uptake of Pi in oocytes. In transgenic rice, the knock-down of either OsPT2 or OsPT6 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased both the uptake and the long-distance transport of Pi from roots to shoots. Taken together, these data suggest OsPT6 plays a broad role in Pi uptake and translocation throughout the plant, whereas OsPT2 is a low-affinity Pi transporter, and functions in translocation of the stored Pi in the plant.
18956194	Characterization of cytoplasmic male sterility of rice with Lead Rice cytoplasm in comparison with that with Chinsurah Boro II cytoplasm.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Rice with LD-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) possesses the cytoplasm of 'Lead Rice' and its fertility is recovered by a nuclear fertility restorer gene Rf1. Rf1 promotes processing of a CMS-associated mitochondrial RNA of atp6-orf79, which consists of atp6 and orf79, in BT-CMS with the cytoplasm of 'Chinsurah Boro II'. In this study, we found that LD-cytoplasm contained a sequence variant of orf79 downstream of atp6. Northern blot analysis showed that atp6-orf79 RNA of LD-cytoplasm was co-transcribed and was processed in the presence of Rf1 in the same manner as in BT-cytoplasm. Western blot analysis showed that the ORF79 peptide did not accumulate in an LD-CMS line, while ORF79 accumulated in a BT-CMS line and was diminished by Rf1. These results suggest that accumulation of ORF79 is not the cause of CMS in LD-cytoplasm and the mechanism of male-sterility induction/fertility restoration in LD-CMS is different from that in BT-CMS.
18952157	Chymotrypsin protease inhibitor gene family in rice: Genomic organization and evidence for the presence of a bidirectional promoter shared between two chymotrypsin protease inhibitor genes.	2009	Gene	Protease inhibitors play important roles in stress and developmental responses of plants. Rice genome contains 17 putative members in chymotrypsin protease inhibitor (ranging in size from 7.21 to 11.9 kDa) gene family with different predicted localization sites. Full-length cDNA encoding for a putative subtilisin-chymotrypsin protease inhibitor (OCPI2) was obtained from Pusa basmati 1 (indica) rice seedlings. 620 bp-long OCPI2 cDNA contained 219 bp-long ORF, coding for 72 amino acid-long 7.7 kDa subtilisin-chymotrypsin protease inhibitor (CPI) cytoplasmic protein. Expression analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that OCPI2 transcript is induced by varied stresses including salt, ABA, low temperature and mechanical injury in both root and shoot tissues of the seedlings. Transgenic rice plants produced with OCPI2 promoter-gus reporter gene showed that this promoter directs high salt- and ABA-regulated expression of the GUS gene. Another CPI gene (OCPI1) upstream to OCPI2 (with 1126 bp distance between the transcription initiation sites of the two genes; transcription in the reverse orientation) was noted in genome sequence of rice genome. A vector that had GFP and GUS reporter genes in opposite orientations driven by 1881 bp intergenic sequence between the OCPI2 and OCPI1 (encompassing the region between the translation initiation sites of the two genes) was constructed and shot in onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. Expression of both GFP and GUS from the same epidermal cell showed that this sequence represents a bidirectional promoter. Examples illustrating gene pairs showing co-expression of two divergent neighboring genes sharing a bidirectional promoter have recently been extensively worked out in yeast and human systems. We provide an example of a gene pair constituted of two homologous genes showing co-expression governed by a bidirectional promoter in rice.
18931143	Characterization of OsbZIP23 as a key player of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family for conferring abscisic acid sensitivity and salinity and drought tolerance in rice.	2008	Plant Physiol	OsbZIP23 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsbZIP23 is strongly induced by a wide spectrum of stresses, including drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatments, while other stress-responsive genes of this family are slightly induced only by one or two of the stresses. Transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional activator, and the sequences at the N terminus (amino acids 1-59) and a region close to the C terminus (amino acids 210-240) are required for the transactivation activity. Transient expression of OsbZIP23-green fluorescent protein in onion (Allium cepa) cells revealed a nuclear localization of the protein. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP23 showed significantly improved tolerance to drought and high-salinity stresses and sensitivity to ABA. On the other hand, a null mutant of this gene showed significantly decreased sensitivity to a high concentration of ABA and decreased tolerance to high-salinity and drought stress, and this phenotype can be complemented by transforming the OsbZIP23 back into the mutant. GeneChip and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that hundreds of genes were up- or down-regulated in the rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP23. More than half of these genes have been annotated or evidenced for their diverse functions in stress response or tolerance. In addition, more than 30 genes that are possible OsbZIP23-specific target genes were identified based on the comparison of the expression profiles in the overexpressor and the mutant of OsbZIP23. Collectively, these results indicate that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can regulate the expression of a wide spectrum of stress-related genes in response to abiotic stresses through an ABA-dependent regulation pathway. We propose that OsbZIP23 is a major player of the bZIP family in rice for conferring ABA-dependent drought and salinity tolerance and has high potential usefulness in genetic improvement of stress tolerance.
18854333	Abscisic acid does not disrupt either the Arabidopsis FCA-FY interaction or its rice counterpart in vitro.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	We examined the effect of (+)-ABA on the in vitro interaction of rice FCA and FY homologs, OsFCA and OsFY. From this analysis, we found no disruption of the OsFCA-OsFY complexes by ABA treatment. This result prompted us to examine the effect of ABA on the FCA-FY interaction. In these experiments, we could not reproduce the inhibitory effect of (+)-ABA on the interaction between FCA and FY. Based on these combined results, we believe that the inhibitory effect of (+)-ABA on the FCA-FY interaction should be cautiously reconsidered.
18826431	TaASY1 promotes homologous chromosome interactions and is affected by deletion of Ph1.	2009	Plant J	During meiosis, chromosomes are sorted into homologous pairs as a preface to their intimate association via recombination and synapsis. However, little is known about the mechanism used to distinguish homologous chromosomes from other chromosomes present in the nucleus. Studies in wheat (Triticum aestivum) have shown that the Pairing homoeologous 1 (Ph1) locus is required to suppress interactions between genetically similar homoeologous chromosomes. Here we show that absence of Ph1 causes increased transcription of Asynapsis 1 (ASY1), a gene that encodes an axial-element-associated protein that is essential for synapsis and cross-over formation in Arabidopsis and rice. Localisation of ASY1 during meiosis is also affected by deletion of Ph1. In addition, transgenic wheat mutants with decreased activity of TaASY1 display reduced synapsis during prophase I and exhibit pairing between homoeologous chromosomes at metaphase I. These results suggest that ASY1 is required to promote interactions between homologous chromosomes in bread wheat, and that Ph1 has a gene regulatory role, which is consistent with its suggested genetic identity as a Cdk-like gene. Broader implications of this research suggest that we could use the Taasy1 mutants to assess their efficacy in alien chromatin introgression studies, as seen with the ph1b mutant.
18826428	Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants.	2009	Plant J	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural disease response in plants, can be induced chemically. Salicylic acid (SA) acts as a key endogenous signaling molecule that mediates SAR in dicotyledonous plants. However, the role of SA in monocotyledonous plants has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the mode of action of the agrochemical protectant chemical probenazole was assessed by microarray-based determination of gene expression. Cloning and characterization of the most highly activated probenazole-responsive gene revealed that it encodes UDP-glucose:SA glucosyltransferase (OsSGT1), which catalyzes the conversion of free SA into SA O-beta-glucoside (SAG). We found that SAG accumulated in rice leaf tissue following treatment with probenazole or 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid. A putative OsSGT1 gene from the rice cultivar Akitakomachi was cloned and the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized, and the results suggested that probenazole-responsive OsSGT1 is involved in the production of SAG. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the OsSGT1 gene significantly reduced the probenazole-dependent development of resistance against blast disease, further supporting the suggestion that OsSGT1 is a key mediator of development of chemically induced disease resistance. The OsSGT1 gene may contribute to the SA signaling mechanism by inducing up-regulation of SAG in rice plants.
18813955	Systematic analysis of NPK1-like genes in rice reveals a stress-inducible gene cluster co-localized with a quantitative trait locus of drought resistance.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Phosphorylation by protein kinase is a ubiquitous key mechanism in translating external stimuli such as drought stress. NPK1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase identified in Nicotiana tabacum and plays important roles in cytokinesis and auxin signaling transduction and responses to multiple stresses. Here we report the evolution, structure, and comprehensive expression profile of 21 NPK1-like genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Phylogenetic analysis of NPK1-like sequences in rice (OsNPKL), Arabidopsis, and other plants reveals that NPK1-like genes could be classified into three subgroups. Three OsNPKL gene clusters, located on chromosome 1 (OsNPKL1, 2, 3, and 4), 5 (OsNPKL14 and 15), and 10 (OsNPKL19 and 20), respectively, were identified in the rice genome. These clustered genes, which most likely evolved by tandem gene duplication, belong to the same phylogenetic subgroup, with similar genomic structures and conserved motifs in the kinase domain, which is unique to this subgroup. Expression analysis of OsNPKL genes under abiotic stresses suggests that the stress-responsive genes are mainly from the same subgroup. Especially interesting is that all the clustered genes are induced by drought, salt, or cold stress, and a few members are very strongly induced by drought. Some of the clustered genes are also induced by abscisic acid. The gene cluster on chromosome 1 is co-located with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to drought resistance. Although the drought-induced expression levels of the four genes in the cluster show no difference between the two parents used for QTL mapping, sequence variation in coding regions of the genes between the parents has provided some clues for further functional characterization of this gene cluster in abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
18810384	Molecular mapping of two reverse photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility genes (rpms1 and rpms2) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The reverse photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS) and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) lines have an opposite phenotype compared with normal PGMS and TGMS lines widely used by the two-line system in current hybrid rice seed production. Thus, the application of reverse PGMS and TGMS lines can compensate PGMS and TGMS lines in hybrid rice production. YiD1S is a reverse PGMS line, in which pollen fertility is mainly regulated by day-length, but also influenced by temperature. Genetic analysis indicated that male sterility of YiD1S was controlled by two recessive major genes. An F(2) population from a cross between YiD1S and 8528 was developed and used for molecular mapping of the two reverse PGMS genes which were first named rpms1 and rpms2. Both simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and bulked segregant analysis (BSA) were used in this study. As a result, one reverse PGMS gene (rpms1) was mapped to the interval between SSR markers RM22980 (0.9 cM) and RM23017 (1.8 cM) on chromosome 8. Eight SSR markers, YDS818, RM22984, RM22986, RM22997, YDS816, RM23002, RM339 and YDS810 completely co-segregated with the rpms1 gene. Another reverse PGMS gene (rpms2) was mapped to the interval between SSR markers RM23898 (0.9 cM) and YDS926 (0.9 cM) on chromosome 9. The physical mapping information from publicly available resources shows that the rpms1 and rpms2 loci are located in a region of 998 and 68 kb, respectively. The analysis based on marker genotypes showed that the effect of rpms1 was slightly larger than that of rpms2 and that the two genes interacted in controlling male sterility.
18790997	Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1.	2008	Plant Physiol	Recent research into the flowering of rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed both unique and conserved genetic pathways in the photoperiodic control of flowering compared with those in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway. This phenotype in the ehd2 mutants suggests that Ehd2 is pivotal for the floral transition in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd2 encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) gene, which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays). Ehd2 mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around the shoot apex and in roots, patterns that are similar to those of ID1. To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants. Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
18778405	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice.	2009	Plant J	Yellowing, which is related to the degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-protein complexes, is a notable phenomenon during leaf senescence. NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 (NYC1) in rice encodes a membrane-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) that is thought to represent a chlorophyll b reductase necessary for catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll b degradation. Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1. In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i.e. the degradation of chlorophyll b was severely inhibited and light-harvesting complex II was selectively retained during senescence, resulting in the retention of thylakoid grana even at a late stage of senescence. The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation. NOL was localized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane despite the lack of a transmembrane domain. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro. These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice.
18777179	Expression of TERF1 in rice regulates expression of stress-responsive genes and enhances tolerance to drought and high-salinity.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Drought and high-salinity are the important constraints that severely affect plant development and crop yield worldwide. It has been established that ethylene response factor (ERF) proteins play important regulatory roles in plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Our previous researches have revealed that transgenic tobacco over-expressing TERF1 (encoding a tomato ERF protein) showed enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress. Here, we further investigate the function of TERF1 in transgenic rice. Compared with the wild-type plants, overexpression of TERF1 resulted in an increased tolerance to drought and high-salt in transgenic rice. And the enhanced tolerance may be associated with the accumulation of proline and the decrease of water loss. Furthermore, TERF1 can effectively regulate the expression of stress-related functional genes Lip5, Wcor413-l, OsPrx and OsABA2, as well as regulatory genes OsCDPK7, OsCDPK13 and OsCDPK19 under normal growth conditions. Our analyses of cis-acting elements show that there exist DRE/CRT and/or GCC-box existing in TERF1 targeted gene promoters. Our results revealed that ectopic expression of TERF1 in rice caused a series of molecular and physiological alterations and resulted in the transgenic rice with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress, indicating that TERF1 might have similar regulatory roles in response to abiotic stress in tobacco and rice.
18774969	Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod.	2008	Plant J	Indeterminate 1 (Id1), a classical flowering gene first reported in 1946, is one of the earliest genes whose expression in leaf tissues affects the floral transition in the shoot meristem. How Id1 is integrated into the flowering process is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the genetic action of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog OsId1. In rice, OsId1 is preferentially expressed in young leaves, but the overall expression pattern is broader than that in maize (Zea mays). OsId1 is able to activate transcription in yeast. RNAi mutants show a delay in flowering under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. OsId1 regulates the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions. In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51. However, the expression of OsId1 is independent of OsGI, OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 (a rice SOC1 ortholog). This study demonstrates that the activation of Ehd1 by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering.
18765808	Rice jmjC domain-containing gene JMJ706 encodes H3K9 demethylase required for floral organ development.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification with both activating and repressive roles in gene expression. Jumonji C (jmjC) domain-containing proteins have been shown to reverse histone methylation in nonplant model systems. Here, we show that plant Jumonji C proteins have both conserved and specific features compared with mammalian homologues. In particular, the rice JMJD2 family jmjC gene JMJ706 is shown to encode a heterochromatin-enriched protein. The JMJ706 protein specifically reverses di- and trimethylations of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) in vitro. Loss-of-function mutations of the gene lead to increased di- and trimethylations of H3K9 and affect the spikelet development, including altered floral morphology and organ number. Gene expression and histone modification analysis indicates that JMJ706 regulates a subset of flower development regulatory genes. Taken together, our data suggest that rice JMJ706 encodes a heterochromatin-associated H3K9 demethylase involved in the regulation of flower development in rice.
18762904	Gametophytically alloplasmic CMS line of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with variant orfH79 haplotype corresponds to specific fertility restorer.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	For years discovery and identification of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) resource in wild rice is the most intriguing events in breeding field. orfH79, a chimeric gene in mitochondria, has been suggested being the determinant for Honglian CMS in rice. In this report orfH79 gene as molecular marker to screen the wild rice, we found eight accessions with orfH79 gene in the total 42 investigated objects. Sequence analysis revealed that there were a total of nine nucleotide substitutions resulting in the change of nine amino acids in the newly identified orfH79 in wild rice, which further fell into seven haplotypes. In order to investigate the underlying relationship between orfH79 haplotypes and the corresponding fertility restorers, four accessions were selected with different orfH79 haplotype as female parents to hybridize the Honglian maintainer line, Yuetai B. After eight consecutive recurrent backcrosses, four alloplasmic CMS lines with different orfH79 haplotype were developed. Microscopic observation exhibited that their pollen grains were spherical and clear in 1% I(2)-KI solution same as that of Honglian CMS line. Moreover, these four CMS lines displayed various fertility restoring model through test cross, suggesting that each orfH79 haplotye represents a new CMS type and corresponds to their specific Rf allele.
18758744	Fine mapping of a strong QTL of field resistance against rice blast, Pikahei-1(t), from upland rice Kahei, utilizing a novel resistance evaluation system in the greenhouse.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Field resistances (FR) against rice blast are highly evaluated by breeders for their durability, in contrast to the conspicuous but often less durable true resistances. However, lack of efficient systems for evaluation of resistance has delayed their practical application. Kahei, an upland domestic cv., is known for its very high FR against rice blast. We fine-mapped its highest quantitative trait loci (QTL), qBFR4-1, using residual heterozygosity of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and our semi-natural rice blast inoculation/evaluation system in the greenhouse, with comparable accuracy to the true resistance genes. This system enabled reproducible high-density infection, and consequently allowed quantification of the resistance level in individual plants. The target region was first narrowed down to about 1 Mb around at 32 Mb from the top of chromosome 4 in the Nipponbare genome, with the upland evaluation system assessing the F7 generation of Koshihikari (lowland, FR: very weak) x Kahei (upland, FR: very strong) RILs. Then, F9 plants (4,404)--siblings of hetero F8 plants at the region--were inoculated with rice blast in a greenhouse using the novel inoculation system, and individual resistance levels were diagnosed for fine QTL analysis and graphical genotyping. Thus, the resistance gene was fine-mapped within 300 kb at 31.2-31.5 Mb on chromosome 4, and designated Pikahei-1(t). By annotation analysis, seven resistance gene analog (RGA) ORFs of nucleotide-binding-site and leucine-rich-repeat (NBS-LRR)-type were found in the center of the region as the most likely candidate counterparts of the resistance gene. This is similar in structure to the recently reported Pik cluster region, suggesting that most of the other dominant QTLs of the FRs may have similar RGA structures.
18723667	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants.	2008	Plant Physiol	Plant cells contain several thioredoxin isoforms that are characterized by subcellular localization and substrate specificity. Here, we describe the functional characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) thioredoxin m isoform (Ostrxm) using a reverse genetics technique. Ostrxm showed green tissue-specific and light-responsive mRNA expression. Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro. RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content. Ostrxm RNAi plants showed remarkably decreased F(v)/F(m) values under high irradiance conditions (1,000 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) with delayed recovery. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants. Furthermore, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, a known target of thioredoxin, was present in oxidized forms, and hydrogen peroxide levels were increased in Ostrxm RNAi plants. The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions.
18701670	Rice ROOT ARCHITECTURE ASSOCIATED1 binds the proteasome subunit RPT4 and is degraded in a D-box and proteasome-dependent manner.	2008	Plant Physiol	Root growth is mainly determined by cell division and subsequent elongation in the root apical area. Components regulating cell division in root meristematic cells are largely unknown. Previous studies have identified rice (Oryza sativa) ROOT ARCHITECTURE ASSOCIATED1 (OsRAA1) as a regulator in root development. Yet, the function of OsRAA1 at the cellular and molecular levels is unclear. Here, we show that OsRAA1-overexpressed transgenic rice showed reduced primary root growth, increased numbers of cells in metaphase, and reduced numbers of cells in anaphase, which suggests that OsRAA1 is responsible for limiting root growth by inhibiting the onset of anaphase. The expression of OsRAA1 in fission yeast also induced metaphase arrest, which is consistent with the fact that OsRAA1 functions through a conserved mechanism of cell cycle regulation. Moreover, a colocalization assay has shown that OsRAA1 is expressed predominantly at spindles during cell division. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, as well as a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, all have revealed that OsRAA1 interacts with a rice homolog of REGULATORY PARTICLE TRIPLE-A ATPASE4, a component that is involved in the ubiquitin pathway. Treating transgenic rice with specific inhibitors of the 26S proteasome blocked the degradation of OsRAA1 and increased the number of cells in metaphase. Mutation of a putative ubiquitination-targeting D-box (RGSLDLISL) in OsRAA1 interrupted the destruction of OsRAA1 in transgenic yeast. These results suggest that ubiquitination and proteasomic proteolysis are involved in OsRAA1 degradation, which is essential for the onset of anaphase, and that OsRAA1 may modulate root development mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a novel regulatory factor of the cell cycle.
18701522	Inference of the japonica rice domestication process from the distribution of six functional nucleotide polymorphisms of domestication-related genes in various landraces and modern cultivars.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Crop domestication can serve as a model of plant evolutionary processes. It involves a series of selection events from standing natural variation and newly occurring mutations and combinations of mutations as a result of natural crossings in populations during local adaptation and propagation of plant lines to other cultivation areas. Our earlier identification of three functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) of distinct genes involved in the rice domestication process led us to propose a model of the japonica rice domestication process. Here, we examined three more FNPs in two domestication-related genes involved in pigment synthesis during the development of seed pericarp color (Rc and Rd) in 91 landraces (and some modern cultivars) of japonica rice collected from throughout the area of distribution of rice. These polymorphisms were assigned by using genome-wide patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and the local origins of the landraces. The results led us to infer the process of japonica rice domestication in more detail and propose a more refined model of the japonica domestication process. In this model, the critical role of the Rc FNP at an early step of the domestication process was highlighted. Independent artificial selections of two defective Rd alleles were found, suggesting a role for Rd other than in pigment synthesis during rice domestication.
18689882	Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for rice grain width and fine mapping of an identified QTL allele gw-5 in a recombination hotspot region on chromosome 5.	2008	Genetics	Rice grain width and shape play a crucial role in determining grain quality and yield. The genetic basis of rice grain width was dissected into six additive quantitative trait loci (QTL) and 11 pairs of epistatic QTL using an F(7) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a single cross between Asominori (japonica) and IR24 (indica). QTL by environment interactions were evaluated in four environments. Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) harboring the six additive effect QTL were used to evaluate gene action across eight environments. A major, stable QTL, qGW-5, consistently decreased rice grain width in both the Asominori/IR24 RIL and CSSL populations with the genetic background Asominori. By investigating the distorted segregation of phenotypic values of rice grain width and genotypes of molecular markers in BC(4)F(2) and BC(4)F(3) populations, qGW-5 was dissected into a single recessive gene, gw-5, which controlled both grain width and length-width ratio. gw-5 was narrowed down to a 49.7-kb genomic region with high recombination frequencies on chromosome 5 using 6781 BC(4)F(2) individuals and 10 newly developed simple sequence repeat markers. Our results provide a basis for map-based cloning of the gw-5 gene and for marker-aided gene/QTL pyramiding in rice quality breeding.
18656444	Castasterone is a likely end product of brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway in rice.	2008	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Brassinolide is known to be the most biologically active compound among more than 50 brassinosteroids identified to date. However, brassinolide has not been detected in rice. To determine if this is due to the lack of the brassinolide synthase function in the rice CYP85A enzyme, we performed analyses to study metabolic conversion using a yeast strain harboring the rice CYP85A1 gene. In repeated feeding tests where the substrates were used, the biosynthetic pathway progressed only up to the synthesis of castasterone, not of brassinolide. Phylogenetic analysis of the CYP85 amino acid sequences revealed that duplication of the CYP85 gene has occurred in most dicotyledonous plant genomes; further, 1 of the 2 copies of CYP85 is evolving to develop a brassinolide synthase function. However, only a single copy of this gene is found in the currently available genome sequences of graminaceous plants; this is a likely explanation for the absence of an endogenous pool of brassinolide in rice plants.
18643988	De novo DNA methylation induced by siRNA targeted to endogenous transcribed sequences is gene-specific and OsMet1-independent in rice.	2008	Plant J	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is an essential factor for epigenetic modification of the genome. Recent studies have suggested that endogenous siRNAs induce DNA methylation, chromatin modification and chromatin inactivation at homologous sequences. We have shown that siRNAs targeted to promoter regions of endogenous rice genes induce strong DNA methylation of the targeted sequences, but transcriptional gene silencing is rarely observed. Here, an analysis of epigenetic modifications induced by RNAi targeted to transcribed regions of endogenous rice genes shows that the effects of siRNA are gene-specific, but that they tend to induce higher de novo DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides than of other cytosines. However, loss of OsMet1 expression by RNAi did not significantly affect levels and patterns of de novo DNA methylation or post-transcriptional mRNA suppression. We also showed that sequence-specific de novo DNA methylation extended both 5' and 3' of the targeted sequences, but there was no significant extension of siRNA signals either 5' or 3'. These results suggest that exogenous siRNAs are strong inducers of de novo DNA methylation in transcribed sequences of rice endogenous genes, but are insufficient to induce heterochromatin formation.
18641966	Genetic analysis of root elongation induced by phosphorus deficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.): fine QTL mapping and multivariate analysis of related traits.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Root elongation induced by phosphorus deficiency has been reported as one of the adaptive mechanisms in plants. Genetic differences were found in rice for the root elongation under phosphorus deficiency (REP), for which a distinct quantitative trait locus (QTL) was detected on the long arm of chromosome 6. Subsequently, the effect and position of the QTL, designated as qREP-6, were confirmed using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), in which the background of a japonica cultivar, 'Nipponbare' with non-REP, was partially substituted by chromosomal segments from an indica cultivar, 'Kasalath' with remarkable REP. Out of 54 CSSLs, two lines (CSSL28 and CSSL29) that retain a common 'Kasalath'-derived segment on the long arm of chromosome 6 showed a significantly high REP. The high REP lines also showed high adaptabilities such as enhanced tillering ability and shoot phosphorus content. Accordingly, conditional dependencies between the related traits were assessed using a graphical Gaussian model (GGM). Direct interactions between REP and root length, and between root length and tiller number were detected under P deficiency in CSSLs. Furthermore, qREP-6 for REP and qTNP-6 for tiller number under P deficiency were fine-mapped with an F(2) population of a cross between Nipponbare and CSSL29. A region containing qREP-6 accounted for more than half of the phenotypic variance, the most plausible interval of which contained 37 candidate genes. The result provides a foundation for cloning of the qREP-6 gene which will be applicable to study P deficiency-dependent response and to improve rice's adaptability to P deficiency stress.
18614714	Manganese efficiency in barley: identification and characterization of the metal ion transporter HvIRT1.	2008	Plant Physiol	Manganese (Mn) deficiency is an important plant nutritional disorder in many parts of the world. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes differ considerably in their ability to grow in soils with low Mn(2+) availability. Differential genotypic Mn efficiency can be attributed to differences in Mn(2+) uptake kinetics in the low nanomolar concentration range. However, the molecular basis for these differences has not yet been clarified. We present here the identification and characterization of the first barley gene encoding a plasma membrane-localized metal transport protein able to transport Mn(2+). The gene is designated HvIRT1 (for IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1) because it belongs to the ZIP gene family and has a high similarity to rice (Oryza sativa) OsIRT1. A novel yeast uptake assay based on inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis of 31 different metal and metalloid ions showed that the HvIRT1 protein, in addition to Mn(2+), also transported Fe(2+)/Fe(3+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+). Both Mn and iron deficiency induced an up-regulation of HvIRT1 in two barley genotypes differing in Mn efficiency, but the expression levels in all cases were highest (up to 40%) in the Mn-efficient genotype. The higher expression of HvIRT1 correlated with an increased Mn(2+) uptake rate. We conclude that HvIRT1 is an important component controlling Mn(2+) uptake in barley roots and contributes to genotypic differences in Mn(2+) uptake kinetics.
18575836	Improvement of lodging resistance with QTLs for stem diameter in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Varietal differences among ten rice cultivars showed that stem diameter is a key factor in lodging resistance (measured in terms of pushing resistance). Two near-isogenic lines (NILs) were selected from a series of chromosome segment substitution lines developed between cultivars Nipponbar and Kasalath, one containing a single stem diameter QTL (sdm8; NIL114), and another with four stem diameter QTLs (sdm1, sdm7, sdm8, sdm12; NIL28). Compared with the Nipponbare control, stem diameters were larger in NIL114 and NIL28 by about 7 and 39%, respectively. Pushing resistance in NIL28 was significantly greater than in Nipponbare, but NIL114 was similar to Nipponbare. The two NILs had greater weight of lower stem and culm wall thickness than Nipponbare. NIL28 had higher plant height, which is a negative effect on lodging resistance, than Nipponbare. The non-structural carbohydrate contents of NIL stems were higher than that of Nipponbare, whereas the silicon contents were lower in the NILs, and cellulose contents were lower only in NIL28. The basal internodes of the two NILs were significantly stiffer than those of Nipponbare. These results suggest that increasing stem diameter in rice breeding programs would improve lodging resistance, although the combination of multiple QTLs would be necessary to produce thicker stems with higher pushing resistance, whereas the higher plant height could also result from the combination of multiple QTLs.
18574592	Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 encodes a beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase involved in biosynthesis of cuticular waxes on rice leaf.	2008	Planta	Cuticular waxes, forming the plant/atmosphere interface of plants colonizing the terrestrial environment, are complex mixtures of very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives. In VLCFAs biosynthesis, beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase (E.C.2.3.1.119, KCS) is the key enzyme. Using T-DNA insertional mutagenesis, we identified a cuticle-deficient rice mutant, which displayed a pleiotropic phenotype including reduced growth, leaf fusion, sparse wax crystals, enhanced sensitivity to drought and low fertility. Further analysis indicated that T-DNA was inserted in the 5'-UTR intron of the affected gene, Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf1 (WSL1), and abnormal transcript caused the loss-of-function of WSL1 gene. Genetic complementation experiment confirmed the function of the candidate gene. WSL1 was predicted to encode a polypeptide containing a conserved FAE1_CUT1_RppA domain typical of the KCS family proteins. Qualitative and quantitative wax composition analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated a marked reduction of total cuticular wax load on wsl1 leaf blades and sheaths, and VLCFA precursors of C20-C24 decreased in both. Moreover, ubiquitous expression of the WSL1 gene gave a hint that WSL1-catalyzed elongation of VLCFAs might participate in a wide range of rice growth and development processes beyond biosynthesis of cuticular waxes.
18557835	A proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of Oryza sativa plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane.	2008	Plant J	Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of rice shoot and root tonoplast-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions were carried out to look at tissue-specific expression, and to identify putative regulatory sites of membrane transport proteins. Around 90 unique membrane proteins were identified, which included primary and secondary transporters, ion channels and aquaporins. Primary H(+) pumps from the AHA family showed little isoform specificity in their tissue expression pattern, whereas specific isoforms of the Ca(2+) pump ECA/ACA family were expressed in root and shoot tissues. Several ABC transporters were detected, particularly from the MDR and PDR subfamilies, which often showed expression in either roots or shoots. Ammonium transporters were expressed in root, but not shoot, tissue. Large numbers of sugar transporters were expressed, particularly in green tissue. The occurrence of phosphorylation sites in rice transporters such as AMT1;1 and PIP2;6 agrees with those previously described in other species, pointing to conserved regulatory mechanisms. New phosphosites were found in many transporters, including H(+) pumps and H(+):cation antiporters, often at residues that are well conserved across gene families. Comparison of root and shoot tissue showed that phosphorylation of AMT1;1 and several further transporters may be tissue dependent.
18516586	A natural mutation in rc reverts white-rice-pericarp to red and results in a new, dominant, wild-type allele: Rc-g.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The Rc locus regulates pigmentation of the rice bran layer, and selection for the rc allele (white pericarp) occurred during domestication of the crop. White bran is now ubiquitous among cultivated varieties throughout rice growing regions of the world. We identified a new allele that arose by natural mutation within the rc pseudogene of the cultivar 'Wells'. The mutation restored the reading frame of the gene, and reverted the bran layer pigmentation to red (wild-type). By sequencing the Rc locus in plants derived from red seeds, and linkage analysis in a segregating population, we were able to demonstrate that mutation within rc resulted in the new, dominant, wild-type allele Rc-g.
18449564	OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice.	2008	Planta	The photoperiod is an important environmental stress that determines flowering time. The CONSTANS (CO) and Heading date 1 (Hd1) genes are known to be central integrators of the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. Although they are both members of the CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) family and have two B-boxes and a CCT domain, rice also possesses novel COL genes that are not found in Arabidopsis. Here, we demonstrate that a novel COL gene, OsCO3, containing a single B-box and a CCT domain, modulates photoperiodic flowering in rice. The circadian expression pattern of OsCO3 mRNA oscillated in a different phase from Hd1 and was similar to that of OsCO3 pre-mRNA, suggesting that the diurnal expression pattern of OsCO3 transcripts may be regulated at the transcriptional level. Overexpression of OsCO3 specifically caused late flowering under short day (SD) conditions relative to wild-type rice plants. The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change. Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway.
18442365	The SNF1-type serine-threonine protein kinase SAPK4 regulates stress-responsive gene expression in rice.	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Plants respond to extracellularly perceived abiotic stresses such as low temperature, drought, and salinity by activation of complex intracellular signaling cascades that regulate acclimatory biochemical and physiological changes. Protein kinases are major signal transduction factors that have a central role in mediating acclimation to environmental changes in eukaryotic organisms. In this study, we characterized the function of the sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) SAPK4 in the salt stress response of rice.

RESULTS: Translational fusion of SAPK4 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed subcellular localization in cytoplasm and nucleus. To examine the role of SAPK4 in salt tolerance we generated transgenic rice plants with over-expression of rice SAPK4 under control of the CaMV-35S promoter. Induced expression of SAPK4 resulted in improved germination, growth and development under salt stress both in seedlings and mature plants. In response to salt stress, the SAPK4-overexpressing rice accumulated less Na+ and Cl- and showed improved photosynthesis. SAPK4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX1, the Cl- channel OsCLC1 and a catalase.

CONCLUSION: Our results show that SAPK4 regulates ion homeostasis and growth and development under salinity and suggest function of SAPK4 as a regulatory factor in plant salt stress acclimation. Identification of signaling elements involved in stress adaptation in plants presents a powerful approach to identify transcriptional activators of adaptive mechanisms to environmental changes that have the potential to improve tolerance in crop plants.
18441339	OsBIRH1, a DEAD-box RNA helicase with functions in modulating defence responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.	2008	J Exp Bot	DEAD-box proteins comprise a large protein family with members from all kingdoms and play important roles in all types of processes in RNA metabolism. In this study, a rice gene OsBIRH1, which encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, was cloned and characterized. The predicted OsBIRH1 protein contains a DEAD domain and all conserved motifs that are common characteristics of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Recombinant OsBIRH1 protein purified from Escherichia coli was shown to have both RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities in vitro. Expression of OsBIRH1 was activated in rice seedling leaves after treatment with defence-related signal chemicals, for example benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid, and was also up-regulated in an incompatible interaction between a resistant rice genotype and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress the OsBIRH1 gene were generated. Disease resistance phenotype assays revealed that the OsBIRH1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Alternaria brassicicola and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Meanwhile, defence-related genes, for example PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and PDF1.2, showed an up-regulated expression in the transgenic plants. Moreover, the OsBIRH1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also showed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated expression levels of oxidative defence genes, AtApx1, AtApx2, and AtFSD1. The results suggest that OsBIRH1 encodes a functional DEAD-box RNA helicase and plays important roles in defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses.
18413994	Flavanone 3beta-hydroxylases from rice: key enzymes for favonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis.	2008	Mol Cells	Flavanone 3beta-hydroxylases (F3H) are key enzymes in the synthesis of flavonol and anthocyanin. In this study, three F3H cDNAs from Oryza sativa (OsF3H-1 approximately 3) were cloned by RT-PCR and expressed in E. coli as gluthatione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The purified recombinant OsF3Hs used flavanone, naringenin and eriodictyol as substrates. The reaction products with naringen and eriodictyol were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be dihydrokaempferol and taxifolin, respectively. OsF3H-1 had the highest enzymatic activity whereas the overall expression of OsF3H-2 was highest in all tissues except seeds. Flavanone 3beta-hydroxylase could be a useful target for flavonoid metabolic engineering in rice.
18392854	Characterization of chromosome ends on the basis of the structure of TrsA subtelomeric repeats in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Subtelomeres contain species-specific repetitive sequences. We characterized rice chromosome ends on the basis of the structure of TrsA, a subtelomeric repetitive sequence of rice. Among the 24 chromosome arms, TrsA was arrayed in tandem on the ends of five: 5L, 6S, 8L, 9L, and 12L. TrsA sequences were arranged in discrete clusters of 3-106 copies in a chromosome-specific manner, instead of being distributed uniformly throughout the subtelomeric regions. The clusters were located at the distal-most end of the sequenced region in 5L, 6S, 8L, and 9L, but in 12L expressed genes were present distal to the clusters. Thus, rice subtelomeres are composed of discrete clusters of a TrsA-rich region and a gene-rich region with high transcriptional activity. Intra-chromosomal duplications have resulted in a striking degree of variation in the number and distribution of TrsAs, suggesting that the areas near the ends of the chromosomes are dynamic and variable.
18356966	Phenotypic characterization, genetic analysis, and molecular mapping of a new mutant gene for male sterility in rice.	2008	Genome	xs1 is a male-sterile rice mutant derived from a spontaneous mutation. The floret of the mutant, consisting of 6 stamens and 1 pistil, looks the same as that of the wild type except that the filaments are long and thin and the anthers are withered in white transparence. It is confirmed that xs1 is a no-pollen type of male-sterile mutant, for no pollen grains can be stained with I(2)-KI solution and the anther locules are always hollow. Anther transverse sections indicate that the mutant microspores are abnormally condensed and agglomerated to form a deeply stained cluster at the late microspore stage, which results in cessation of the vacuolation process of microspores, and, therefore, the mutant forms no functional pollens for reproduction. Genetic analysis of 4 F(2) populations and 3 BC(1)F(1) populations revealed that the mutation is controlled by a single recessive gene, termed VR1 (Vacuolation retardation 1). Screening of 432 F(2) mutant individuals derived from the cross of xs1 x G603 with simple sequence repeat markers revealed that VR1 is located between the molecular markers RM17411 and RM5030, at distances of 0.7 and 1.5 cM, respectively, on chromosome 4. VR1 is a new male fertility controlling gene located on chromosome 4 in rice.
18356944	Identification of stably expressed quantitative trait loci for cooked rice elongation in non-Basmati varieties.	2008	Genome	The elongation of the cooked grain determines the cooking and eating quality of Basmati rice. The identification of stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs), especially those from non-Basmati types, will extend the genetic basis of the Basmati type and facilitate the breeding of high-quality varieties. A set of recombinant inbred lines derived from an indica x japonica hybrid was used to identify QTLs controlling the elongation ratio (ER), elongation index (EI), and water absorption (WA) of the cooked grain. Three ER QTLs on chromosomes 2, 4, and 12, two EI QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 5, and two WA QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 6 were detected. Four of these QTLs were validated using a set of established chromosome segment substitution lines. The genetic effect of qER-2 was explored in an analysis of segregating generations, using 8 newly developed simple sequence repeat markers. Two tightly linked loci (qER-2a and qER-2b) were identified on chromosome 2.
18321185	Identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), required for rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta-mediated resistance.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Resistance to the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is proposed to be initiated by physical binding of a putative cytoplasmic receptor encoded by a nucleotide binding site-type resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the processed elicitor encoded by the corresponding avirulence gene AVR-Pita. Here, we report the identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), that is required for Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. A Pi-ta-expressing susceptible mutant was identified using a genetic screen. Putative mutations at Ptr(t) do not alter recognition specificity to another resistance gene, Pi-k(s), in the Pi-ta homozygote, indicating that Ptr(t) is more likely specific to Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. Genetic crosses of Pi-ta Ptr(t) and Pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes suggest that Ptr(t) segregates as a single dominant nuclear gene. A ratio of 1:1 (resistant/susceptible) of a population of BC1 of Pi-ta Ptr(t) with pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes indicates that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are linked and cosegregate. Genotyping of mutants of pi-ta ptr(t) and Pi-ta Ptr(t) homozygotes using ten simple sequence repeat markers at the Pi-ta region determined that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are located within a 9-megabase region and are of indica origin. Identification of Ptr(t) is a significant advancement in studying Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition and transduction.
18317796	OsCYT-INV1 for alkaline/neutral invertase is involved in root cell development and reproductivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Planta	A short root mutant was isolated from an EMS-generated rice mutant library. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant exhibited short root, delayed flowering, and partial sterility. Some sections of the roots revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis was reduced and the cell shape in the root elongation zone shrank. Genetic analysis indicated that the short root phenotype was controlled by a recessive gene. Map-based cloning revealed that a nucleotide substitution causing an amino acid change from Gly to Arg occurred in the predicted rice gene (Os02g0550600). It coded an alkaline/neutral invertase and was homologous to Arabidopsis gene AtCyt-inv1. This gene was designated as OsCyt-inv1. The results of carbohydrate analysis showed an accumulation of sucrose and reduction of hexose in the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. These results indicated that OsCyt-inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice.
18295371	A zinc-dependent nuclear endonuclease is responsible for DNA laddering during salt-induced programmed cell death in root tip cells of rice.	2008	J Plant Physiol	DNA laddering is one of the biochemical processes characteristic of programmed cell death (PCD) both in animals and plants. However, the mechanism of DNA laddering varies in different species, even in different tissues of one organism. In the present study, we used root tip cells of rice, which have been induced by NaCl stress to undergo PCD, to analyze the endonuclease activities of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. Two endonucleases, a cytoplasmic of 20kDa (OsCyt20) and a nuclear of 37kDa (OsNuc37), were identified as PCD related. Our results indicated that OsCyt20 is a Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent nuclease, which is most active at neutral pH, and that OsNuc37 is Zn(2+)-dependent, with a pH optimum of 4.5-6. Both nucleases were induced at the early stage of PCD (2h salt treatment) and exhibited the highest activity approximately 4h after exposure to NaCl, paralleling with the occurrence of DNA laddering. In vitro assays of endonuclease activities further revealed that OsNuc37, a glycoprotein localized in the nucleus, is the executor for DNA laddering. The different effects of both endonucleases on DNA degradation during salt-induced PCD are discussed.
18193274	Identification of an OsPR10a promoter region responsive to salicylic acid.	2008	Planta	Orysa sativa pathogenesis-related protein 10a (OsPR10a) was induced by pathogens, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethephon, abscisic acid (ABA), and NaCl. We tried to analyze the OsPR10a promoter to investigate the transcriptional regulation of OsPR10a by SA. We demonstrated the inducibility of OsPR10a promoter by SA using transgenic Arabidopsis carrying OsPR10a:GFP as well as by transient expression assays in rice. To further identify the promoter region responsible for its induction by SA, four different deletions of the OsPR10a promoter were made, and their activities were measured by transient assays. The construct containing 687-bp OsPR10a promoter from its start codon exhibited a six-fold increase of induction compared to the control in response to SA. Mutation in the W-box like element 1 (WLE 1) between 687 and 637-bp from TGACA to TGAAA completely abolished induction of the OsPR10a promoter by SA, indicating that the WLE 1 between -687 and -637 of OsPR10a promoter is important in SA-mediated OsPR10a expression. We show for the first time that the W-box like element plays a role in SA mediated PR gene expression.
18073417	Large-scale survey of cytosine methylation of retrotransposons and the impact of readout transcription from long terminal repeats on expression of adjacent rice genes.	2007	Genetics	Transposable elements (TEs) represent approximately 45% of the human genome and 50-90% of some grass genomes. While most elements contain inactivating mutations, others are reversibly inactivated (silenced) by epigenetic mechanisms, including cytosine methylation. Previous studies have shown that retrotransposons can influence the expression of adjacent host genes. In this study, the methylation patterns of TEs and their flanking sequences in different tissues were undertaken using a novel technique called transposon methylation display (TMD). TMD was successfully applied on a highly copied (approximately 1000 copies), newly amplified LTR retrotransposon family in rice called Dasheng. We determined that the methylation status of a subset of LTRs varies in leaves vs. roots. In addition, we determined that tissue-specific LTR methylation correlated with tissue-specific expression of the flanking rice gene. Genes showing tissue-specific expression were in opposite orientation relative to the LTR. Antisense transcripts were detected in the tissue where the sense transcripts from that gene were not detected. Comparative analysis of Dasheng LTR methylation in the two subspecies, japonica vs. indica revealed LTR-mediated differences in subspecies gene expression. Subspecies-specific expression was due either to polymorphic Dasheng insertion sites between the two subspecies or to subspecies-specific methylation of LTRs at the same locus accounted for observed differences in the expression of adjacent genes.
18064488	Expression of rice heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA2e enhances tolerance to environmental stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2008	Planta	Plant growth and crop yields are limited by high-temperature stresses. In this study, we attempted to isolate the rice genes responsible for high-temperature stress tolerance using a transformed Arabidopsis population expressing a full-length cDNA library of rice. From approximately 20,000 lines of transgenic Arabidopsis, we isolated a thermotolerant line, R04333, that could survive transient heat stress at the cotyledon stage. The rice cDNA inserted in R04333 encodes OsHsfA2e, a member of the heat stress transcription factors. The thermotolerant phenotype was observed in newly constructed transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsHsfA2e. Among 5 A2-type HSF genes encoded in the rice genome, four genes, including OsHsfA2e, are induced by high temperatures in rice seedlings. The OsHsfA2e protein was localized to the nuclear region and exhibited transcription activation activity in the C-terminal region. Microarray analysis demonstrated that under unstressed conditions transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing OsHsfA2e highly expressed certain stress-associated genes, including several classes of heat-shock proteins. The thermotolerant phenotype was observed not only in the cotyledons but also in rosette leaves, inflorescence stems and seeds. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited tolerance to high-salinity stress. These observations suggest that the OsHsfA2e may be useful in molecular breeding designed to improve the environmental stress tolerance of crops.
18022281	The expression pattern of a rice proteinase inhibitor gene OsPI8-1 implies its role in plant development.	2008	J Plant Physiol	A rice proteinase inhibitor (PI) gene OsPI8-1 was identified. Belonging to the potato inhibitor I family, this gene contains a 201bp coding region with no introns and encodes a deduced protein of 66 amino acids which holds a PI domain. There are two uniform gene copies, OsPI8-1a and OsPI8-1b, with direct-repeat arrangement and an interval span of 13 kb on rice chromosome 8, corresponding to the site of BAC clone P0528B09 (Accession No. AP004703). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays showed that both OsPI8-1a and OsPI8-1b can be expressed in wild-type 'Zhonghua No.11'. To investigate the physiological functions of OsPI8-1 in plant development, we analyzed the expression patterns of the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by OsPI8-1 promoter at different developmental stages and tissues. It was demonstrated that no GUS signals were detected in the roots. Despite that very high GUS expression was examined in the shoot apical meristem, no detectable GUS activity in the developmental domains of leaf primordium was observed. OsPI8-1 promoter showed an obvious wound-induced response in mature leaves. Little GUS activity was detected in young nodes and internodes at the seedling stage, but active GUS expression was observed near the nodes on mature culms. In the developing stage of the anther, GUS signal was specifically located in the middle layer and the endothecium between the epidermis and tapetum. In the germinating seed, GUS expression was gradually accumulated in the side of scutellar epithelium close to the embryo. These tissue-specific accumulations suggested that OsPI8-1 has multiple endogenous roles on developmental regulation. In this report, the inhibitor function of OsPI8-1 to proteolytic enzymes and the potential influence of their poise on plant development (such as seed germination, tapetum degeneration, programmed cell death, etc.) were discussed.
17960484	Overexpression of rice WRKY89 enhances ultraviolet B tolerance and disease resistance in rice plants.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	WRKY proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators involved in a variety of biological processes in plants. Here we report functional characterization of a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY89. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV-B radiation. The transient expression analysis of the OsWRKY89-eGFP reporter in onion epidermal cells revealed that OsWRKY89 was targeted to nuclei. Transcriptional activity assays of OsWRKY89 and its mutants fused with a GAL4 DNA binding domain indicated that the 67 C-terminal amino acids were required for the transcriptional activation and that the leucine zipper region at the N-terminus enhanced its transcriptional activity. Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi-mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines. Moreover, extractable and cell-wall-bound phenolic compounds were decreased in the overexpressor lines, but its SA levels were increased. Lignin staining showed an increase in lignification in culms of the overexpressor lines. Interestingly, overexpression of the OsWRKY89 gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white-backed planthopper as well as tolerance to UV-B irradiation. These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
17960419	New target for rice lodging resistance and its effect in a typhoon.	2008	Planta	We demonstrated the new target for lodging resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by the analysis of physiological function of a locus for lodging resistance in a typhoon (lrt5) with the near isogenic line under rice "Koshihikari" genetic background (tentatively named S1). The higher lodging resistance of S1 was observed during a typhoon in September 2004 (28 days after heading), when most other plants in "Koshihikari" became lodged. Visual observations showed that bending of the upper stems triggered lodging during the typhoon; the upper stem of "Koshihikari" buckled completely, whereas that of S1 remained straight. In addition to the strong rain and winds during the typhoon, the weight of the buckled upper plant parts increased the pressure on adjacent plants and caused a domino effect in "Koshihikari". Young's modulus, an indicator of the rigidity of the culm, was significantly higher in S1 than in "Koshihikari". In the upper culm, the starch content in S1 was 4.8 times the value in "Koshihikari", and senescence was delayed in the upper leaves of S1. These results suggest that the rigidity of the upper culm by the higher starch content (as a result of delayed senescence in the upper leaves) may be responsible for the higher lodging resistance during a typhoon in rice.
17943312	Cation dependent O-methyltransferases from rice.	2008	Planta	Two lower molecular mass OMT genes (ROMT-15 and -17) were cloned from rice and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. ROMT-15 and -17 metabolized caffeoyl-CoA, flavones and flavonols containing two vicinal hydroxyl groups, although they exhibited different substrate specificities. The position of methylation in both luteolin and quercetin was determined to be the 3' hydroxyl group and myricetin and tricetin were methylated not only at 3' but also at 5' hydroxyl groups. ROMT-15 and -17 are cation-dependent and mutation of the predicted metal binding sites resulted in the loss of the enzyme activity, indicating that the metal ion has a critical role in the enzymatic methylation.
17908158	TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice.	2007	Plant J	A critical step during rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation is dense planting: a wider tiller angle will increase leaf shade and decrease photosynthesis efficiency, whereas a narrower tiller angle makes for more efficient plant architecture. The molecular basis of tiller angle remains unknown. This research demonstrates that tiller angle is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, TAC1 (Tiller Angle Control 1). TAC1 was mapped to a 35-kb region on chromosome 9 using a large F(2) population from crosses between an indica rice, IR24, which displays a relatively spread-out plant architecture, and an introgressed line, IL55, derived from japonica rice Asominori, which displays a compact plant architecture with extremely erect tillers. Genetic complementation further identified the TAC1 gene, which harbors three introns in its coding region and a fourth 1.5-kb intron in the 3'-untranslated region. A mutation in the 3'-splicing site of this 1.5-kb intron from 'AGGA' to 'GGGA' decreases the level of tac1, resulting in a compact plant architecture with a tiller angle close to zero. Further sequence verification of the mutation in the 3'-splicing site of the 1.5-kb intron revealed that the tac1 mutation 'GGGA' was present in 88 compact japonica rice accessions and TAC1 with 'AGGA' was present in 21 wild rice accessions and 43 indica rice accessions, all with the spread-out form, indicating that tac1 had been extensively utilized in densely planted rice grown in high-latitude temperate areas and at high altitudes where japonica rice varieties are widely cultivated.
17895583	Knockout of glutelin genes which form a tandem array with a high level of homology in rice by gamma irradiation.	2007	Genes Genet Syst	In the course of evolution, a gene is often duplicated in tandem, resulting in a functional redundancy. The analysis of function of these genes by raising double mutant might be difficult because they are very tightly linked. We described here a mutant of such a tandem duplicated gene. glu1 is a gamma-ray-induced rice mutant, which lacks an acidic subunit of glutelin, a major seed storage protein. We found that glu1 harbors a 129.7-kb deletion involving two highly similar and tandem repeated glutelin genes, GluB5 and GluB4. The deletion eliminated the entire GluB5 and GluB4 gene except half of the first exon of GluB5. GluB5 and GluB4 have the same amino acid sequence in the acidic subunit, suggesting that only the mutation involving both GluB5 and GluB4 results in the lack of the glutelin acidic subunit deleted in glu1. Our finding suggests that gamma-ray can be an effective mutagen to analyze tandem repeated and functionally redundant genes.
17893719	Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of a nuclear recessive male sterility gene, ms91(t), in rice.	2007	Genome	Mutations that result in plant male sterility provide means not only to probe reproductive development but also to facilitate commercial heterosis application and hybrid seed production. In this study, we report a novel male sterility gene, ms91(t), in a spontaneous mutant line (SH38) from a Chinese rice cultivar (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica 'Jijing14'). The sterility of SH38 was studied by examining its progenies derived from crosses with 6 japonica cultivars. Corresponding F2 populations were obtained by selfing each of the 6 F1s and a backcross population was produced by crossing SH38 to the F1 of SH38 x C18. Our results revealed that SH38 has normal agronomic traits but produces no pollen grains. Segregations of male-sterile and male-fertile progenies in the F2 and backcross populations fit well with ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, respectively, indicating that ms91(t) is a single recessive gene. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of SH38 and Jijing14 plants showed the presence of a unique band in SH38. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis of the bulked and individual progenies of the F2 population of SH38 x C18 showed linkage of ms91(t) with the SSR marker RM5853 on chromosome 1. Subsequently, ms91(t) was fine-mapped to the interval between markers RM7075 (3.75 cM) and RM5638 (3.57 cM). Our results would facilitate the isolation of ms91(t) and male sterility in heterosis application.
17884044	Molecular evolution and selection of a gene encoding two tandem microRNAs in rice.	2007	FEBS Lett	It has been shown that overexpression of MIR156b/c resulted in a bushy phenotype in maize and rice. Our results indicated that the MIR156b/c locus was highly conserved among cereals, but not in dicots and that genome duplication events played an important role in the evolution of the miR156 family. Genetic diversity investigation at the locus indicated that only approximately 9% of nucleotide diversity observed in wild rice (O. rufigogon) was maintained in the cultivated rice and the neutral model was rejected (P<0.05) based on Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D( *) and F( *) tests. To our knowledge, this is the first example of miRNA gene to be targeted by both natural and domestication selection in plants.
17870591	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds.	None	Plant Physiol Biochem	The makorin (MKRN) RING finger protein gene family encodes proteins (makorins) with a characteristic array of zinc-finger motifs and which are present in a wide array of eukaryotes. In the present study, we analyzed the structure and expression of a putative makorin RING finger protein gene in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare). From the analysis of the genomic (AP003543), mRNA (AK120250) and deduced protein (BAD61603) sequences of the putative MKRN gene of rice, obtained from GenBank, we found that it was indeed a bona fide member of the MKRN gene family. The rice MKRN cDNA encoded a protein with four C3H zinc-finger-motifs, one putative Cys-His zinc-finger motif, and one RING zinc-finger motif. The presence of this distinct motif organization and overall amino acid identity clearly indicate that this gene is indeed a true MKRN ortholog. We isolated RNA from embryonic axes of rice seeds at various stages of imbibition and germination and studied the temporal expression profile of MKRN by RT-PCR. This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were present at all the time points studied. It was at very low levels in dry seeds, increased slowly during imbibition and germination, and slightly declined in the seedling growth stage. After 6days of germination, an organ-dependent expression pattern of MKRN was observed: highest in roots and moderate in leaves. Similarly to MKRN transcripts, transcripts of cytoskeletal actin and tubulin were also detected in dry embryos, steadily increased during imbibition and germination and leveled off after 24h of germination. We studied the spatial expression profile of MKRN in rice tissues, by using a relatively fast, simple and effective non-radioactive mRNA in situ hybridization (NRISH) technique, which provided the first spatial experimental data that hints at the function of a plant makorin. This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination. The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice.
17764506	Evolutionary dynamics of an ancient retrotransposon family provides insights into evolution of genome size in the genus Oryza.	2007	Plant J	Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute a significant portion of most eukaryote genomes and can dramatically change genome size and organization. Although LTR retrotransposon content variation is well documented, the dynamics of genomic flux caused by their activity are poorly understood on an evolutionary time scale. This is primarily because of the lack of an experimental system composed of closely related species whose divergence times are within the limits of the ability to detect ancestrally related retrotransposons. The genus Oryza, with 24 species, ten genome types, different ploidy levels and over threefold genome size variation, constitutes an ideal experimental system to explore genus-level transposon dynamics. Here we present data on the discovery and characterization of an LTR retrotransposon family named RWG in the genus Oryza. Comparative analysis of transposon content (approximately 20 to 27,000 copies) and transpositional history of this family across the genus revealed a broad spectrum of independent and lineage-specific changes that have implications for the evolution of genome size and organization. In particular, we provide evidence that the basal GG genome of Oryza (O. granulata) has expanded by nearly 25% by a burst of the RWG lineage Gran3 subsequent to speciation. Finally we describe the recent evolutionary origin of Dasheng, a large retrotransposon derivative of the RWG family, specifically found in the A, B and C genome lineages of Oryza.
17710555	Expression and enzyme activity of glutathione reductase is upregulated by Fe-deficiency in graminaceous plants.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Glutathione reductase (GR) plays an important role in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. We studied the expression patterns and enzyme activities of GR in graminaceous plants under Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions by isolating cDNA clones for chloroplastic GR (HvGR1) and cytosolic GR (HvGR2) from barley. We found that the sequences of GR1 and GR2 were highly conserved in graminaceous plants. Based on their nucleotide sequences, HvGR1 and HvGR2 were predicted to encode polypeptides of 550 and 497 amino acids, respectively. Both proteins showed in vitro GR activity, and the specific activity for HvGR1 was 3-fold that of HvGR2. Northern blot analyses were performed to examine the expression patterns of GR1 and GR2 in rice (Os), wheat (Ta), barley (Hv), and maize (Zm). HvGR1, HvGR2, and TaGR2 were upregulated in response to Fe-deficiency. Moreover, HvGR1 and TaGR1 were mainly expressed in shoot tissues, whereas HvGR2 and TaGR2 were primarily observed in root tissues. The GR activity increased in roots of barley, wheat, and maize and shoot tissues of rice, barley, and maize in response to Fe-deficiency. Furthermore, it appeared that GR was not post-transcriptionally regulated, at least in rice, wheat, and barley. These results suggest that GR may play a role in the Fe-deficiency response in graminaceous plants.
17690841	T-DNA tagged knockout mutation of rice OsGSK1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis BIN2, with enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	T-DNA-tagged rice plants were screened under cold- or salt-stress conditions to determine the genes involved in the molecular mechanism for their abiotic-stress response. Line 0-165-65 was identified as a salt-responsive line. The gene responsible for this GUS-positive phenotype was revealed by inverse PCR as OsGSK1 (Oryza sativa glycogen synthase kinase3-like gene 1), a member of the plant GSK3/SHAGGY-like protein kinase genes and an orthologue of the Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2), AtSK21. Northern blot analysis showed that OsGSK1 was most highly detected in the developing panicles, suggesting that its expression is developmental stage specific. Knockout (KO) mutants of OsGSK1 showed enhanced tolerance to cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses when compared with non-transgenic segregants (NT). Overexpression of the full-length OsGSK1 led to a stunted growth phenotype similar to the one observed with the gain-of-function BIN/AtSK21 mutant. This suggests that OsGSK1 might be a functional rice orthologue that serves as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling. Therefore, we propose that stress-responsive OsGSK1 may have physiological roles in stress signal-transduction pathways and floral developmental processes.
17651366	The plastid sigma factor SIG1 maintains photosystem I activity via regulated expression of the psaA operon in rice chloroplasts.	2007	Plant J	Sigma factors encoded by the nucleus of plants confer promoter specificity on the bacterial-type RNA polymerase in chloroplasts. We previously showed that transcripts of OsSIG1, which encodes one such sigma factor in rice, accumulate relatively late during leaf development. We have now isolated and characterized two allelic mutants of OsSIG1, in which OsSIG1 is disrupted by insertion of the retrotransposon Tos17, in order to characterize the functions of OsSIG1. The OsSIG1-/- plants were found to be fertile but they manifested an approximately one-third reduction in the chlorophyll content of mature leaves. Quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses of chloroplast gene expression revealed that the abundance of transcripts derived from the psaA operon was markedly reduced in OsSIG1-/- plants compared with that in wild-type homozygotes. This effect was accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of the core protein complex (PsaA-PsaB) of photosystem I. Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence also revealed a substantial reduction in the rate of electron transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I in the OsSIG1 mutants. Our results thus indicate that OsSIG1 plays an important role in the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in mature chloroplasts of rice by regulating expression of chloroplast genes for components of photosystem I.
17594063	Mutations in the rice liguleless gene result in a complete loss of the auricle, ligule, and laminar joint.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	The area between the upper part of the leaf sheath and the basal portion of the leaf blade contains several specialized organs, such as the laminar joint, auricle and ligule. Here we report the identification of T-DNA insertional mutant lines that lack all of these organs. The gene knocked out in the mutant lines encodes a protein that contains a SBP (SQUAMOSA promoter Binding Protein)-domain and is highly homologous to the maize LIGULELESS1 (LG1) gene. At the amino acid sequence level, the OsLG1 protein is 69% identical to maize LG1 and 78% identical to barley LG1. We named the rice gene OsLIGULELESS1 (OsLG1). Transient expression of an OsLG1:RFP (Red Fluorescent Protein) fusion protein indicated that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Transgenic plants harboring the OsLG1 promoter:GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene construct display preferential expression in developing laminar joint regions and meristemic regions. The gene is also weakly expressed in the ligule, auricles, and leaf sheaths at the basal region. These results indicate that OsLG1 is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in building the laminar joint between leaf blade and leaf sheath boundary, thereby controlling ligule and auricle development.
17562186	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	OsDMC1 is the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach. The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility. The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi. Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression. Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the OsDMC1-RNAi lines were defective in homologous pairing. These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing.
17559517	The rice bHLH protein OsIRO2 is an essential regulator of the genes involved in Fe uptake under Fe-deficient conditions.	2007	Plant J	Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major abiotic stress in crop production. Although responses to Fe deficiency in graminaceous plants, such as increased production and secretion of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), have been described, the gene regulation mechanisms related to these responses are largely unknown. To elucidate the regulation mechanisms of the genes related to Fe acquisition in graminaceous plants, we characterized the Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsIRO2 in rice. In yeast cells, OsIRO2 functioned as a transcriptional activator. In rice, overexpression of OsIRO2 resulted in increased MAs secretion, whereas repression of OsIRO2 resulted in lower MAs secretion and hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency. Northern blots revealed that the expression of the genes involved in the Fe(III)-MAs transport system was dependent on OsIRO2. The expression of the genes for nicotianamine synthase, a key enzyme in MAs synthesis, was notably affected by the level of OsIRO2 expression. Microarray analysis demonstrated that OsIRO2 regulates 59 Fe-deficiency-induced genes in roots. Some of these genes, including two transcription factors upregulated by Fe deficiency, possessed the OsIRO2 binding sequence in their upstream regions. OsIRO2 possesses a homologous sequence of the Fe-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements (IDEs) in its upstream region. We propose a novel gene regulation network for Fe-deficiency responses, including OsIRO2, IDEs and the two transcription factors.
17559513	RING-H2 type ubiquitin ligase EL5 is involved in root development through the maintenance of cell viability in rice.	2007	Plant J	Rice EL5 is an ATL family gene characterized by a transmembrane domain at the N-terminal and a RING-H2 finger domain (RFD), which exhibits ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity. To elucidate the physiological roles of EL5, we analyzed transgenic rice plants overexpressing mutant EL5 proteins that are impaired in E3 activity to various degrees. Plants expressing EL5C153A and EL5W165A, which encode an inactive E3, showed a rootless phenotype accompanied by cell death in root primordia, and those expressing EL5V162A, with moderately impaired E3 activity, formed short crown roots with necrotic lateral roots. The dominant-negative phenotype was specifically observed in root meristems where EL5 is expressed, and not recovered by exogenous auxin. When wild-type EL5 was transcriptionally overexpressed, the EL5 protein was barely detected by Western blotting. Neither treatment with a proteasome inhibitor nor mutation of the sole lysine residue, a potential target of ubiquitination, resulted in increased EL5 accumulation, whereas mutations in the RFD led to increased EL5 accumulation. The stabilized EL5 without the RFD was localized in the plasma membrane. Deletion of the transmembrane domain prevented the EL5 from localizing in the membrane and from exerting an inhibitory effect on root formation. Deletion of the C-terminal region also neutralized the negative effect. We concluded that EL5 plays a major role as a membrane-anchored E3 for the maintenance of cell viability after the initiation of root primordial formation. In addition, we propose that EL5 is an unstable protein, of which degradation is regulated by the RFD in a proteasome-independent manner.
17549515	Overexpression of OsCOIN, a putative cold inducible zinc finger protein, increased tolerance to chilling, salt and drought, and enhanced proline level in rice.	2007	Planta	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant is sensitive to chilling, particularly at early stages of seedling development. Here a novel cold-inducible gene, designated OsCOIN (Oryza sativa cold-inducible), was isolated and characterized. Results showed that OsCOIN protein, a RING finger protein, was localized in both nuclear and cytoplasm membrane. OsCOIN is expressed in all rice organs and strongly induced by low temperature, ABA, salt and drought. Over-expression of OsCOIN in transgenic rice lines significantly enhanced their tolerance to cold, salt and drought, accompanied by an up-regulation of OsP5CS expression and an increase of cellular proline level.
17522954	Biochemical properties of a plastidial DNA polymerase of rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Plastids are organelles unique to plant cells and are responsible for photosynthesis and other metabolic functions. Despite their important cellular roles, relatively little is known about the mechanism of plastidial DNA replication and repair. Recently, we identified a novel DNA polymerase in Oryza Sativa L. (OsPOLP1, formerly termed OsPolI-like) that is homologous to prokaryotic DNA polymerase Is (PolIs), and suggested that this polymerase might be involved in plastidial DNA replication and repair. Here, we propose to rename the plant PolI homologs as DNA polymerase pi (POLP), and investigate the biochemical properties of full-length OsPOLP1. The purified OsPOLP1 elongated both DNA and RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template, and possessed a 3' exonuclease activity. Moreover, OsPOLP1 displayed high processivity and fidelity, indicating that this polymerase has the biochemical characteristics appropriate for DNA replication. We found that POLPs have two extra sequences in the polymerase domain that are absent in prokaryotic PolIs. Deletion of either insert from OsPOLP1 caused a decrease in DNA synthetic activity, processivity, and DNA binding activity. In addition, OsPOLP1 efficiently catalyzed strand displacement on nicked DNA with a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate, suggesting that this enzyme might be involved in a repair pathway similar to long-patch base excision repair. These results provide insights into the possible role of POLPs in plastidial DNA replication and repair.
17522952	Analysis of rice genes induced by striped stemborer (Chilo suppressalis) attack identified a promoter fragment highly specifically responsive to insect feeding.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	The objective of this study was to identify rice gene promoters that are specifically induced by feeding of the striped stemborer (Chilo suppressalis). Two PCR-selected cDNA subtractive libraries were constructed from the rice variety Minghui 63. Up- and down-regulated cDNAs induced by C. suppressalis feeding were arrayed on nylon membranes. After array hybridization and Northern blot analysis, a cDNA (B1-A04) encoding a putative subtilisin/chymotrypsin inhibitor was found to be rapidly and highly induced by C. suppressalis feeding, compared with mechanical wounding. The putative promoter region, spanning from -1,569 to +446 relative to the transcriptional initiation site was isolated, fused to the GUS gene (beta-glucuronidase reporter gene) and introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to rice. In non-infested plants, the GUS activity driven by this promoter fragment was detected in culms and panicles, but not in leaves and sheaths. At 6 h after insect feeding, GUS activity was significantly induced in sheaths and culms, but not in leaves. GUS activity and native B1-A04 gene were not induced by JA and ABA treatment. A serial deletion analysis revealed two regions (-1,569 to -1,166 and -1,166 to -582) that negatively regulate the gene expression in sheaths of non-infested plants but not in insect-infested plants. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) identified 7 DNA fragments with various binding activities with nuclear proteins from mechanically wounded, insect-infested and untreated plants, and their possible roles in gene regulation were speculated. This promoter fragment should have utility in development of insect resistant transgenic crops.
17502899	STS markers for the wheat yellow rust resistance gene Yr5 suggest a NBS-LRR-type resistance gene cluster.	2007	Genome	Two sequence-tagged site (STS) markers for the wheat yellow rust resistance (R) gene Yr5 have been derived through the identification and characterization of linked amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). The sequences of the 2 AFLP markers partially overlap with one another, but belong to discrete loci: S19M93-140 completely cosegregates with Yr5, whereas S23M41-310 maps at a distance of 0.7 cM. The DNA sequence of S23M41-310 shows significant homology with the 3' end of nucleotide-binding site (NBS) - leucine-rich repeat (LRR) - type R-genes, in particular with orthologues of the rice bacterial blight R-gene Xa-I. The distinct genetic location of the 2 AFLP loci suggests that Yr5 falls within an R-gene cluster. Because neither sequence forms part of a detectable transcription product, we propose that the Yr5 R-gene cluster includes R-gene analogues and pseudogenes. A Yr5 flanking simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker has also been identified, which allows Yr5 to be effectively incorporated, along with other R-genes for yellow rust, into elite wheat genetic backgrounds, through marker-assisted selection.
17245561	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40) functions in many different pathways in plants, and has recently been implicated in plant defense such as in responses to wounding and UV-B radiation. In this study, we isolated a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone by using the differential display method and screening of a root cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa. L) under carbonate (NaHCO3) stress, and identified it as one of the rice NADP-ME genes (we named it NADP-ME2, GenBank accession no. AB053295). The 5' end of NADP-ME2 was obtained by the 5'-RACE method, and the full-length cDNA had a length of 2217 bp encoding 593 amino acids. Expression of NADP-ME2 mRNA in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3, NaCl, and environmental pH changes. NADP-ME2 transcripts increased during 72-h exposures to NaHCO3, NaCl, and PEG stresses. Furthermore, NADP-ME activities in leaves and roots of rice seedlings increased by more than 50% in the presence of carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), NaCl, and PEG. These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 were obtained through transformation, screening, Northern analysis and in situ NADP-ME activity assay. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited. In addition, under 125 mM NaCl stress, the root lengths of transgenic lines were about twice as long as those of the WT. These results suggest that NADP-ME2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress.
17115300	Transcriptomic adaptations in rice suspension cells under sucrose starvation.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Sugar is an important resource for energy generation and developmental regulation in plants, and sucrose starvation causes enormous changes in cellular morphology, enzyme activities and gene expression. Genome-wide gene expression profiling provides a comprehensive knowledge of gene expression under nutrient depletion and senescence; however, that of a monocot model plant, rice, under sucrose depletion is still under investigation. Here, the time-course monitoring of gene expression profiles in sucrose-starved rice (Oryza sativa cv Tainung67) suspension cells was investigated by 21495 probes contained in Agilent rice chip. In sucrose-starved cells, the induced vacuolar biogenesis coincided with significantly upregulated transcripts of H+-pyrophosphatase, delta-TIP, one putative alpha-TIP, several vacuolar proteases and proteinase inhibitors, and one OsATG3. To survey the overall metabolic adaptations under sucrose depletion, the genes with significantly altered expression level were incorporated into multiple metabolic pathways. Most genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthesis and degradation pathways of various macromolecules were comprehensively down-and upregulated, respectively, with sucrose starvation. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is important for physiological adaptations to environmental stress, and many transcription factors, including bZIPs, NACs, and WRKY, showed significant increase in transcriptional level under sucrose starvation. Concurrently, statistical analysis revealed that their corresponding consensus cis-elements, such as ABA-responsive element, CACG, ACI, ACII and CTTATCC, were frequently found in the promoter regions of many sucrose starvation-upregulated genes. Particle bombardment-mediated and luciferase activity-based transient promoter assays revealed the CTTATCC, derived form TATCCA, and the AC motifs to be promising sucrose-starvation responsive activators in rice suspension cells.
17036080	Exact word matches in rice pseudomolecules.	2006	Genome	Using pseudomolecules of assembled genomic sequence, we computed the frequencies of 6 to 24 bp oligonucleotide (oligo) "words" across the genome of rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica). All oligos of 10 or fewer basepairs were repeated at least 12 times in the genome. The percentage of unique (non-repeated) oligos ranged from 0.1% for 12 bp oligos to 76.0% for 24 bp oligos. For three 200 kb regions, we annotated each nucleotide position with the genome-wide frequency of the 18 bp oligo starting at that position. These frequencies formed landscapes consisting of high- and low-frequency zones. Low-frequency zones contained occasional high-frequency spikes; these may represent footprints of RIM2 transposon activity. BLASTn searches of high-frequency non-SSR (simple sequence repeat) 18 bp oligos returned few sequences from species other than rice. These results demonstrate that, in rice, words are not randomly used between different regions within the same genome, and indicate that words that are frequently repeated within the rice genome tend to be unique to rice.
17036076	Fine mapping of a pistilloid-stamen (PS) gene on the short arm of chromosome 1 in rice.	2006	Genome	A novel floral organ mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica), termed pistilloid-stamen (ps) here, has flowers with degenerated lemma and palea, with some stamens transformed into pistils and pistil-stamen chimeras. Genetic analysis confirmed that the ps trait is controlled by a single recessive gene. F2 and F3 segregation populations derived from PS ps heterozygote crossed with Oryza sativa subsp. indica 'Luhui-17' (PS PS) were used for molecular mapping of the gene using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. With 97 recessive individuals from an F2 segregation population, the ps locus was preliminarily mapped 6.2 cM distal to marker RM6324 and 3.1 cM proximal to marker RM6340 in the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 1. With a large F3 segregation population, the gene was fine-mapped between markers RM6470 and RM1141, at distances of 0.10 and 0.03 cM to each marker, respectively. The position of the ps gene was finally located within a 20 kb physical region containing 3 annotated putative genes. One of them, encoding a protein with a single C2H2 zinc-finger domain, may be the candidate gene for PS.
17032619	Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the rice dehydroascorbate reductase gene are resistant to salt stress.	2006	J Plant Physiol	Vitamin C (l-ascorbate) is important for antioxidative and metabolic functions in both plants and humans. Ascorbate itself is oxidized to dehydroascorbate during the process of antioxidation, and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) re-reduces the oxidized ascorbate. Therefore, this enzyme is assumed to be critical for ascorbate recycling. Here we show that the expression of rice DHAR in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced resistance to salt stress. Salt tolerance was remarkably improved despite slight increases in DHAR activity and total ascorbate. This study provides direct evidence for the importance of DHAR in salt tolerance.
16959252	Rice embryogenic calli express a unique set of microRNAs, suggesting regulatory roles of microRNAs in plant post-embryogenic development.	2006	FEBS Lett	In vitro cultured embryogenic callus was employed as a model to investigate microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with embryogenesis and post-embryonic development. Thirty-one miRNAs including 16 novel species were identified from a large number of small RNAs which were cloned from both differentiated and undifferentiated rice embryogenic calli. Four target genes of the miRNAs were further validated. A set of the miRNAs, including miR397 and miR156, exhibited intriguing expression patterns during the transition from undifferentiated to differentiated calli. By exploiting the correlations between the differential expression patterns of these miRNAs and their targets, the regulatory roles of the miRNAs on meristem maintenance and embryogenesis were indicated.
16805731	Functional and signaling mechanism analysis of rice CRYPTOCHROME 1.	2006	Plant J	Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue-light photoreceptors that mediate various light responses, such as inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, enhancement of cotyledon expansion, anthocyanin accumulation and stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. The signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through direct interaction with COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. CRY has now been characterized in tomato, pea, moss and fern, but its function in monocots is largely unknown. Here we report the function and basic signaling mechanism of rice cryptochrome 1 (OsCRY1). Overexpresion of OsCRY1b resulted in a blue light-dependent short hypcotyl phenotype in Arabidopsis, and a short coleoptile, leaf sheath and leaf blade phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa). On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), the C-terminal domain of either OsCRY1a (OsCCT1a) or OsCRY1b (OsCCT1b) mediated a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype in both Arabidopsis and rice, whereas OsCCT1b mutants corresponding to missense mutations in previously described Arabidopsis cry1 alleles failed to confer a COP phenotype. Yeast two-hybrid and subcellular co-localization studies demonstrated that OsCRY1b interacted physically with rice COP1 (OsCOP1). From these results, we conclude that OsCRY1 is implicated in blue-light inhibition of coleoptile and leaf elongation during early seedling development in rice, and that the signaling mechanism of OsCRY1 involves direct interaction with OsCOP1.
16766513	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress.	2006	DNA Res	14-3-3 proteins function as major regulators of primary metabolism and cellular signal transduction in plants. However, their involvement in plant defense and stress responses is largely unknown. In order to better address functions of the rice 14-3-3/GF14 proteins in defense and abiotic stress responses, we examined the rice GF14 family that comprises eight numbers. The phylogenetic comparison with the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family revealed that the majority of rice GF14s might have evolved as an independent branch. At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and the incompatible interactions stronger induced the genes than the compatible interactions. These GF14 genes were also induced by the defense compounds, benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate, ethephon and hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, they were differentially regulated by salinity, drought, wounding and abscisic acid. Tissue-specific analysis and expression of GF14-YFP fusions revealed that the four GF14 isoforms were expressed with tissue specificity and accumulated differentially in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our current study provides fundamental information for the further investigation of the rice GF14 proteins.
16755133	Genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship in AA Oryza species as revealed by Rim2/Hipa CACTA transposon display.	2006	Genes Genet Syst	CACTA is a class 2 transposon, that is very abundantly present in plant genomes. Using Rim2/Hipa CACTA transposon display (hereafter Rim2/Hipa-TD), we analyzed several A-genome diploid Oryza species that have a high distribution of the CACTA motifs. High levels of polymorphism were detected within and between the Oryza species. The African taxa, O. glaberrima and O. barthii, both showed lower levels of polymorphism than the Asian taxa, O. sativa, O. rufipogon, and O. nivara. However, O. longistaminata, another African taxon, showed levels of polymorphism that were similar to the Asian taxa. The Latin American taxon, O. glumaepatula, and the Australian taxon, O. meridionalis, exhibited intermediate levels of polymorphism between those of the Asian and African taxa. The lowest level of polymorphism was observed in O. glaberrima (32.1%) and the highest level of polymorphism was observed in O. rufipogon (95.7%). The phylogenetic tree revealed three major groups at the genetic similarity level of 0.409. The first group consisted of three Asian taxa, O. sativa, O. rufipogon and O. nivara. The second group consisted of three African taxa, O. glaberrima, O. barthii, O. longistaminata, and an American taxon, O. glumaepatula. The third group contained an Australian taxon, O. meridionalis. The clustering patterns of these species matched well with their geographical origins. Rim2/Hipa-TD appears to be a useful marker system for studying the genetic diversity and species relationships among the AA diploid Oryza species.
16713279	Exogenous cytokinin treatment maintains cyclin homeostasis in rice seedlings that show changes of cyclin expression when the photoperiod is rapidly changed.	2006	Plant Physiol Biochem	Cyclin is a fundamental regulator of the plant cell cycle. Five different types of cyclin genes (the A-, B-, C-, D-, and H-types) have been reported in Oryza sativa. However, except for Os;cycA1;1, Os;cycB2;1, and Os;cycB2;2, the mechanisms of expression of these cyclin genes have not yet been studied. The interactions of cyclins with cytokinin, an important trigger for cell cycle regulation, have also not been well studied. Here we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR in rice seedlings to analyze the effect of cytokinin on photomorphogenesis and the expression of six cyclin genes. Fifteen-day-old seedlings were grown in a 16/8 h light/dark cycle and then transferred to either constant light or constant dark. The expression of all the cyclin genes tested, except the C-type, decreased after 1 hour in the dark, but did not change after transfer to the light or when kinetin was added to the medium. Similarly, seedlings grown in the dark had decreased expression of the cyclin genes, except Os;cycB2;2, after transfer to the light, a decrease that was prevented by kinetin treatment. Thus, exogenous cytokinin plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of cyclin gene expression following rapid changes of photoperiod.
16623891	Production and characterization of auxin-insensitive rice by overexpression of a mutagenized rice IAA protein.	2006	Plant J	Since auxin was first isolated and characterized as a plant hormone, the underlying molecular mechanism of auxin signaling has been elucidated primarily in dicot plants represented by Arabidopsis. In monocot plants, the molecular mechanism of auxin signaling has remained unclear, despite various physiological experiments. To understand the function and mechanism of auxin signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), we focused on the IAA gene, a well-studied gene in Arabidopsis that serves as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. We found 24 IAA gene family members in the rice genome. OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin. We produced transgenic rice harboring mOsIAA3-GR, which can overproduce mutant OsIAA3 protein containing an amino acid change in domain II to cause a gain-of-function phenotype, by treatment with dexamethasone. The transgenic rice was insensitive to auxin and gravitropic stimuli, and exhibited short leaf blades, reduced crown root formation, and abnormal leaf formation. These results suggest that, in rice, auxin is important for development and its signaling is mediated by IAA genes.
16604111	Rapid evolution in sequence and length of the nuclear-located gene for mitochondrial L2 ribosomal protein in cereals.	2006	Genome	The L2 ribosomal protein is typically one of the most conserved proteins in the ribosome and is universally present in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cytosolic and organellar ribosomes. It is usually 260-270 amino acids long and its binding to the large-subunit ribosomal RNA near the peptidyl transferase center is mediated by a beta-barrel RNA-binding domain with 10 beta strands. In the diverse land plants Marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) and Oryza sativa (rice), the mitochondrial-encoded L2 ribosomal protein is about 500 amino acids long owing to a centrally located expansion containing the beta3-beta4 strand region. We have determined that, in wheat, the functional rpl2 gene has been transferred to the nucleus and much of the plant-specific internal insert has been deleted. Its mRNA is only 1.2 kb, and two expressed copies in wheat encode proteins of 318 and 319 amino acids, so they are considerably shorter than the maize nuclear-located rpl2 gene of 448 codons. Comparative sequence analysis of cereal mitochondrial L2 ribosomal proteins indicates that the mid region has undergone unexpectedly rapid evolution during the last 60 million years.
16582442	Characterization and mapping of a shattering mutant in rice that corresponds to a block of domestication genes.	2006	Genetics	Easy shattering reduces yield due to grain loss during harvest in cereals. Shattering is also a hindrance in breeding programs that use wild accessions because the shattering habit is often linked to desirable traits. We characterized a shattering mutant line of rice, Hsh, which was derived from a nonshattering japonica variety, Hwacheong, by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment. The breaking tensile strength (BTS) of the grain pedicel was measured using a digital force gauge to evaluate the degree of shattering of rice varieties at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after heading (DAH). The BTS of Hwacheong did not decrease with increasing DAH, maintaining a level of 180-240 gf, while that of Hsh decreased greatly during 10-20 DAH and finally stabilized at 50 gf. Optical microscopy revealed that Hsh had a well-developed abscission layer similar to the wild rice Oryza nivara (accession IRGC105706), while Hwacheong did not produce an abscission layer, indicating that the shattering of Hsh was caused by differentiation of the abscission layer. On the basis of the BTS value and morphology of the abscission layer of F(1) plants and segregation data in F(2) populations, it was concluded that the easy shattering of Hsh was controlled by the single recessive gene sh-h. The gene sh-h was determined to be located on rice chromosome 7 by bulked segregant analysis. Using 14 SSR markers on rice chromosome 7, the gene sh-h was mapped between the flanking markers RM8262 and RM7161 at distances of 1.6 and 2.0 cM, respectively. An SSR marker Rc17 cosegregated with the gene sh-h. The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the Rc locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice.
16397796	Rice ascorbate peroxidase gene family encodes functionally diverse isoforms localized in different subcellular compartments.	2006	Planta	Aerobic organisms evolved a complex antioxidant system, which protect the cells against oxidative damage caused by partially reduced oxygen intermediates, also known as reactive oxygen species. In plants, ascorbate peroxidases (EC, 1.11.1.11) catalyze the conversion of H(2)O(2) to H(2)O, using ascorbate as the specific electron donor in this enzymatic reaction. Previously, eight APx genes were identified in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome through in silico analysis: two cytosolic isoforms, two putative peroxisomal isoforms, and four putative chloroplastic ones. Using gene-specific probes, we confirmed the presence of the eight APx genes in the rice genome by Southern blot hybridization. Transcript accumulation analysis showed specific expression patterns for each member of the APx family according to developmental stage and in response to salt stress, revealing the complexity of the antioxidant system in plants. Finally, the subcellular localization of rice APx isoforms was determined using GFP-fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. In agreement with the initial prediction, OSAPX3 was localized in the peroxisomes. On the other hand, the OSAPX6-GFP fusion protein was found in mitochondria of the BY-2 cells, in contrast to the chloroplastic location predicted by sequence analysis. Our findings reveal the functional diversity of the rice APx genes and suggest complementation and coordination of the antioxidant defenses in different cellular compartments during development and abiotic stress.
16362329	Expression profiling of starch metabolism-related plastidic translocator genes in rice.	2006	Planta	The genes encoding the major putative rice plastidic translocators involved in the carbon flow related to starch metabolism were identified by exhaustive database searches. The genes identified were two for the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), five for the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) including putatively non-functional ones, four for the phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT), three for the putative ADP-glucose translocator (or Brittle-1 protein, BT1), two for the plastidic nucleotide transport protein (NTT), and one each for the plastidic glucose translocator (pGlcT) and the maltose translocator (MT). The expression patterns of the genes in various photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. OsBT1-1 was specifically expressed in the seed and its transcript level tremendously increased at the onset of vigorous starch production in the endosperm, suggesting that the ADP-glucose synthesized in the cytosol is a major precursor for starch biosynthesis in the endosperm amyloplast. In contrast, all of the genes for OsTPT, OsPPT, and OsNTT were mainly expressed in source tissues, suggesting that their proteins play essential roles in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts. Substantial expression of the four OsGPT genes and the OspGlcT gene in both source and sink organs suggests that the transport of glucose phosphate and glucose is physiologically important in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The present study shows that comprehensive analysis of expression patterns of the plastidic translocator genes is a valuable tool for the elucidation of the functions of the translocators in the regulation of starch metabolism in rice.
16272412	Dormancy genes from weedy rice respond divergently to seed development environments.	2006	Genetics	Genes interacting with seed developmental environments control primary dormancy. To understand how a multigenic system evolved to adapt to the changing environments in weedy rice, we evaluated genetic components of three dormancy QTL in a synchronized nondormant genetic background. Two genetically identical populations segregating for qSD1, qSD7-1, and qSD12 were grown under greenhouse and natural conditions differing in temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity during seed development. Low temperatures tended to enhance dormancy in both conditions. However, genotypes responded to the environments divergently so that two populations displayed similar distributions for germination. Additive and/or dominance effects of the three loci explained approximately 90% of genetic variances and their epistases accounted for the remainder in each environment. The qSD1 and qSD7-1 main effects were increased, while the qSD12 additive effect was decreased by relatively low temperatures. Both gene main and epistatic effects were involved in G x E interactions, which in magnitude were greater than environmental main effect. The divergent responses of dormancy genes observed in this simple multigenic system presumably have selective advantages in natural populations adapted to changing environments and hence represent a genetic mechanism stabilizing the dormancy level of weedy rice ripened in different seasons or temperature regimes.
17086397	Genes for alkaline/neutral invertase in rice: alkaline/neutral invertases are located in plant mitochondria and also in plastids.	2007	Planta	Two cDNA clones (OsNIN1 and OsNIN3) encoding an alkaline/neutral invertase localized in organelles were identified from rice. The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNA clones showed high homology to other plant alkaline/neutral invertases. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of OsNIN1 was constitutive and independent of organ difference, although its expression level was low. Analyses using five types of web software for the prediction of protein localization in the cell, Predotar, PSORT, Mitoprot, TargetP, and ChloroP, strongly supported the possibility that OsNIN1 is transported into the mitochondria and that OsNIN3 is transported into plastids. Transient expression of fusion proteins combining the amino terminal region of these two proteins with sGFP demonstrated that N-OsNIN1::GFP and N-OsNIN3::GFP fusion proteins were transported into the mitochondria and plastids, respectively. We expressed the OsNIN1 protein in vitro and revealed that the translated protein had an invertase activity. These results clearly indicate that some of alkaline/neutral invertases are located in plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids, and that they might have a novel physiological function in plant organelles.
17185738	Unique properties of NADP-thioredoxin reductase C in legumes.	2007	J Exp Bot	NADP-thioredoxin reductases (NTRs) reduce thioredoxins (Trxs), using NADPH as a reductant, together constituting complete redox systems (NTS). Beside NTRA and NTRB targeted to both cytosol and mitochondria of plant cells, there is in chloroplasts an unusual NTR (NTRC) harbouring a Trx domain in a C-terminal extension, as recently reported in Oryza sativa. Although NTRC may constitute a complete NTS, it was described as a bifunctional enzyme. Because the gene is only present in photosynthetic organisms and the protein in green tissues, NTRC was thought to have a role restricted to photosynthetic cells. To determine whether NTRC from dicot plants is a bifunctional enzyme or a complete NTS, as well as to identify its putative target, NTRC from Medicago truncatula was cloned and NTRA was cloned for comparison. Here evidence is presented that MtNTRC (i) acts as an NTS and reduces dithiobisnitrobenzoate (DTNB) with a turnover (0.62 s(-1)) similar to that measured with MtNTRA in the presence of a Trxh (0.81 s(-1)); (ii) is able to use both NADPH (k(M)=2.4 microM) and NADH (k(M)=11 microM) as cofactors; (iii) efficiently reduces BAS1, a plastidial peroxiredoxin; and (iv) is expressed in both leaves and stems but unexpectedly is even more abundant in cotyledons from dry and germinating seeds. Because BAS1 is also present in both green tissues and seeds, NTRC/BAS1 may be involved in the scavenging of peroxides produced in green tissues during the day or the night and in seeds during germination. These results suggest different roles for NTRC in monocot and dicot plants.
17364223	Overexpression of salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase reduces salicylic acid-mediated pathogen resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	We cloned a salicylic acid/benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase gene, OsBSMT1, from Oryza sativa. A recombinant OsBSMT1 protein obtained by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli exhibited carboxyl methyltransferase activity in reactions with salicylic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BA), and de-S-methyl benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid (dSM-BTH), producing methyl salicylate (MeSA), methyl benzoate (MeBA), and methyl dSM-BTH (MeBTH), respectively. Compared to wild-type plants, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing OsBSMT1 accumulated considerably higher levels of MeSA and MeBA, some of which were vaporized into the environment. Upon infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae or the fungal pathogen Golovinomyces orontii, transgenic plants failed to accumulate SA and its glucoside (SAG), becoming more susceptible to disease than wild-type plants. OsBSMT1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed little induction of PR-1 when treated with SA or G. orontii. Notably, incubation with the transgenic plant was sufficient to trigger PR-1 induction in neighboring wild-type plants. Together, our results indicate that in the absence of SA, MeSA alone cannot induce a defense response, yet it serves as an airborne signal for plant-to-plant communication. We also found that jasmonic acid (JA) induced AtBSMT1, which may contribute to an antagonistic effect on SA signaling pathways by depleting the SA pool in plants.
17389586	Dicot and monocot plants differ in retinoblastoma-related protein subfamilies.	2007	J Exp Bot	The present study supports the view that the retinoblastoma functions are shared by two distinct retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein subfamilies in the monocot cereal species, whereas dicot plants have only a single RBR protein. Genes encoding RBR proteins were identified and characterized in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The alfalfa MsRBR gene encodes a new member of the dicot RBR proteins (subfamily A). A comparison was made of two rice genes, OsRBR1 (subfamily B) and OsRBR2 (subfamily C), which exhibit differences in exon-intron organization and share only 52% amino acid sequence identity. The plant RBR proteins can be categorized into three distinct subfamilies, in which the similarity between members is greater than the similarity to other RBR proteins from the same species. Comparison of the transcript levels in various tissues revealed that the expression of the OsRBR1 gene was high in embryos or cultured cells and gradually decreased from the basal region to the tip of the leaves. The OsRBR2 gene displayed more transcripts in differentiated tissues, such as leaves and roots. In contrast, the mRNA level of the MsRBR gene did not differ significantly in either mature leaves or cultured cells. The results of yeast two-hybrid pairwise interaction assays demonstrated differences between the rice RBR variants in the interactions with the phosphatase 2A B'' regulatory subunit and an unknown protein. The in silico and functional data presented in this work highlight considerable differences between dicot and monocot species in the retinoblastoma regulatory pathways and permit an improved classification of RBR proteins in higher plants.
17875553	Function-unknown glycoside hydrolase family 31 proteins, mRNAs of which were expressed in rice ripening and germinating stages, are alpha-glucosidase and alpha-xylosidase.	2007	J Biochem	In rice (Oryza sativa L., var Nipponbare) seeds, there were three mRNAs encoding for function-unknown hydrolase family 31 homologous proteins (ONGX-H1, ONGX-H3 and ONGX-H4): ONGX-H1 mRNA was expressed in ripening stage and mRNAs of ONGX-H3 and ONGX-H4 were found in both the ripening and germinating stages [Nakai et al., (2007) Biochimie 89, 49-62]. This article describes that the recombinant proteins of ONGX-H1 (rONGXG-H1), ONGX-H3 (rONGXG-H3) and ONG-H4 (rONGXG-H4) were overproduced in Pichia pastoris as fusion protein with the alpha-factor signal peptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Purified rONGXG-H1 and rONGXG-H3 efficiently hydrolysed malto-oligosaccharides, kojibiose, nigerose and soluble starch, indicating that ONGX-H1 and ONGX-H3 are alpha-glucosidases. Their substrate specificities were similar to that of ONG2, a main alpha-glucosidase in the dry and germinating seeds. The rONGXG-H1 and rONGX-H3 demonstrated the lower ability to adsorb to and degradation of starch granules than ONG2 did, suggesting that three alpha-glucosidases, different in action to starch granules, were expressed in ripening stage. Additionally, purified rONGXG-H4 showed the high activity towards alpha-xylosides, in particular, xyloglucan oligosaccharides. The enzyme hardly hydrolysed alpha-glucosidic linkage, so that ONGX-H4 was an alpha-xylosidase. Alpha-xylosidase encoded in rice genome was found for the first time.
18263782	OsPHR2 is involved in phosphate-starvation signaling and excessive phosphate accumulation in shoots of plants.	2008	Plant Physiol	Previous research has demonstrated that AtPHR1 plays a central role in phosphate (Pi)-starvation signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, two OsPHR genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1. Their functions in Pi signaling in rice were investigated using transgenic plants. Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi-starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi-starvation-induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi-sufficient conditions. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, overexpression of OsPHR2 mimics Pi-starvation stress in rice with enhanced root elongation and proliferated root hair growth, suggesting the involvement of OsPHR2 in Pi-dependent root architecture alteration by both systematic and local pathways. In OsPHR2-overexpression plants, some Pi transporters were up-regulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, which correlates with the strongly increased content of Pi. The mechanism behind the OsPHR2 regulated Pi accumulation will provide useful approaches to develop smart plants with high Pi efficiency.
18208525	Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice.	2008	Plant J	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) or vivipary in cereals is an important agronomic trait that results in significant economic loss. A considerable number of mutations that cause PHS have been identified in several species. However, relatively few viviparous mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been reported. To explore the mechanism of PHS in rice, we carried out an extensive genetic screening and identified 12 PHS mutants (phs). Based on their phenotypes, these phs mutants were classified into three groups. Here we characterize in detail one of these groups, which contains mutations in genes encoding major enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, including phytoene desaturase (OsPDS), zeta-carotene desaturase (OsZDS), carotenoid isomerase (OsCRTISO) and lycopene beta-cyclase (beta-OsLCY), which are essential for the biosynthesis of carotenoid precursors of ABA. As expected, the amount of ABA was reduced in all four phs mutants compared with that in the wild type. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis revealed the occurrence of photoinhibition in the photosystem and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants. These results suggest that the impairment of carotenoid biosynthesis causes photo-oxidation and ABA-deficiency phenotypes, of which the latter is a major factor controlling the PHS trait in rice.
18266919	The tryptophan pathway is involved in the defense responses of rice against pathogenic infection via serotonin production.	2008	Plant J	The upregulation of the tryptophan (Trp) pathway in rice leaves infected by Bipolaris oryzae was indicated by: (i) enhanced enzyme activity of anthranilate synthase (AS), which regulates metabolic flux in the Trp pathway; (ii) elevated levels of the AS (OASA2, OASB1, and OASB2) transcripts; and (iii) increases in the contents of anthranilate, indole, and Trp. The measurement of the contents of Trp-derived metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that serotonin and its hydroxycinnamic acid amides were accumulated in infected leaves. Serotonin accumulation was preceded by a transient increase in the tryptamine content and by marked activation of Trp decarboxylase, indicating that enhanced Trp production is linked to the formation of serotonin from Trp via tryptamine. Feeding of radiolabeled serotonin to inoculated leaves demonstrated that serotonin is incorporated into the cell walls of lesion tissue. The leaves of a propagating-type lesion mimic mutant (sl, Sekiguchi lesion) lacked both serotonin production and deposition of unextractable brown material at the infection sites, and showed increased susceptibility to B. oryzae infection. Treating the mutant with serotonin restored deposition of brown material at the lesion site. In addition, the serotonin treatment suppressed the growth of fungal hyphae in the leaf tissues of the sl mutant. These findings indicated that the activation of the Trp pathway is involved in the establishment of effective physical defenses by producing serotonin in rice leaves.
18680302	Biosynthetic mechanism of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline and its relationship with Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid and methylglyoxal in aromatic rice (Oryza sativa L.) callus.	2008	J Agric Food Chem	2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) was identified as the major flavor compound in aromatic rice varieties Tainung 71 and 72. In order to understand the mechanism of 2-AP biosynthesis in aromatic rice, we studied the formation of putative precursors, Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid and methylglyoxal. The endogenous Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid contents of Tainung 71 and 72 calli reached 191 to 276%, compared to nonaromatic rice Tainung 67. In addition, calli of Tainung 71 and 72 contained 1.30- and 1.36-fold, respectively, higher methylglyoxal levels than that of Tainung 67. Specific enzyme activities of Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid-synthetic enzyme including Delta(1)-pyrolline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) increased significantly in aromatic rice varieties. The expression levels of P5CS1 and P5CS2 genes were found to be significantly higher in aromatic rice than nonaromatic rice. Results of a tracer experiment with (15)N-labeled glutamic acid revealed that the nitrogen atom of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline was derived from glutamic acid. Upregulation of P5CS in aromatic rice Tainung 72 may contribute to the increase of Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid level and thus leads to the accumulation of an extra amount of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.
18663452	Generation of selectable marker-free sheath blight resistant transgenic rice plants by efficient co-transformation of a cointegrate vector T-DNA and a binary vector T-DNA in one Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Co-transformation of Oryza sativa L. var. Pusa Basmati1 was done using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harbouring a single-copy cointegrate vector and a multi-copy binary vector in the same cell. The T-DNA of the cointegrate vector pGV2260::pSSJ1 carried the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) and beta-glucuronidase (gus) genes. The binary vector pCam-chi11, without a plant selectable marker gene, harboured the rice chitinase (chi11) gene under maize ubiquitin promoter. Co-transformation of the gene of interest (chi11) with the selectable marker gene (hph) occurred in 4 out of 20 T(0) plants (20%). Segregation of hph from chi11 was accomplished in two (CoT6 and CoT23) of the four co-transformed plants in the T(1) generation. The selectable marker-free (SMF) lines CoT6 and CoT23 harboured single copies of chi11. Homozygous SMF T(2) plants were established in the lines CoT6 and CoT23. Northern and Western blot analysis of the homozygous SMF lines showed high level of transgene expression. In comparison to untransformed controls, chitinase specific activity was 66- and 22-fold higher in the homozygous SMF T(2) plants of lines CoT6 and CoT23, respectively. The lines CoT6 and CoT23 exhibited 38 and 40% reduction in sheath blight disease, respectively.
18679687	Osmyb4 expression improves adaptive responses to drought and cold stress in transgenic apples.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Constitutive expression of the rice cold-inducible Osmyb4 gene in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants improves adaptive responses to cold and drought stress, most likely due to the constitutive activation of several stress-inducible pathways and to the accumulation of several compatible solutes (e.g., glucose, fructose, sucrose, proline, glycine betaine and some aromatic compounds). Although the Osmyb4 gene seems able to activate stress responsive pathways in different species, we previously reported that its specific effect on stress tolerance depends on the transformed species. In the present work, we report the effects of the Osmyb4 expression for improving the stress response in apple (Malus pumila Mill.) plants. Namely, we found that the ectopic expression of the Myb4 transcription factor improved physiological and biochemical adaptation to cold and drought stress and modified metabolite accumulation. Based on these results it may be of interest to use Osmyb4 as a tool for improving the productivity of woody perennials under environmental stress conditions.
17876344	Genome-wide analysis of the phospholipase D family in Oryza sativa and functional characterization of PLD beta 1 in seed germination.	2007	Cell Res	Phospholipase D (PLD) plays a critical role in plant growth and development, as well as in hormone and stress responses. PLD encoding genes constitute a large gene family that are present in higher plants. There are 12 members of the PLD family in Arabidopsis thaliana and several of them have been functionally characterized; however, the members of the PLD family in Oryza sativa remain to be fully described. Through genome-wide analysis, 17 PLD members found in different chromosomes have been identified in rice. Protein domain structural analysis reveals a novel subfamily, besides the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs, that is present in rice - the SP-PLD. SP-PLD harbors a signal peptide instead of the C2 or PXPH domains at the N-terminus. Expression pattern analysis indicates that most PLD-encoding genes are differentially expressed in various tissues, or are induced by hormones or stress conditions, suggesting the involvement of PLD in multiple developmental processes. Transgenic studies have shown that the suppressed expression of rice PLD beta 1 results in reduced sensitivity to exogenous ABA during seed germination. Further analysis of the expression of ABA signaling-related genes has revealed that PLD beta 1 stimulates ABA signaling by activating SAPK, thus repressing GAmyb expression and inhibiting seed germination.
19767453	The rice alpha-amylase glycoprotein is targeted from the Golgi apparatus through the secretory pathway to the plastids.	2009	Plant Cell	The well-characterized secretory glycoprotein, rice (Oryza sativa) alpha-amylase isoform I-1 (AmyI-1), was localized within the plastids and proved to be involved in the degradation of starch granules in the organelles of rice cells. In addition, a large portion of transiently expressed AmyI-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (AmyI-1-GFP) colocalized with a simultaneously expressed fluorescent plastid marker in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. The plastid targeting of AmyI-1 was inhibited by both dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana ARF1 and Arabidopsis SAR1, which arrest endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi traffic. In cells expressing fluorescent trans-Golgi and plastid markers, these fluorescent markers frequently colocalized when coexpressed with AmyI-1. Three-dimensional time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted cells demonstrated that contact of the Golgi-derived membrane vesicles with cargo and subsequent absorption into plastids occur within the cells. The transient expression of a series of C-terminal-truncated AmyI-1-GFP fusion proteins in the onion cell system showed that the region from Trp-301 to Gln-369 is necessary for plastid targeting of AmyI-1. Furthermore, the results obtained by site-directed mutations of Trp-302 and Gly-354, located on the surface and on opposite sides of the AmyI-1 protein, suggest that multiple surface regions are necessary for plastid targeting. Thus, Golgi-to-plastid traffic appears to be involved in the transport of glycoproteins to plastids and plastid targeting seems to be accomplished in a sorting signal-dependent manner.
14745172	Proteomic identification of alpha-amylase isoforms encoded by RAmy3B/3C from germinating rice seeds.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We isolated and identified 10 alpha-amylase isoforms by using beta-cyclodextrin Sepharose affinity column chromatography and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from germinating rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds. Immunoblots with anti-alpha-amylase I-1 and II-4 antibodies indicated that 8 isoforms in 10 are distinguishable from alpha-amylase I-1 and II-4. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis showed that there exist novel isoforms encoded by RAmy3B and RAmy3C genes. The optimum temperature for enzyme reaction of the RAmy3B and RAmy3C coding isoforms resembled that of alpha-amylase isoform II-4 (RAmy3D). Furthermore, complex protein polymorphism resulted from a single alpha-amylase gene was found to occur not only in RAmy3D, but also in RAmy3B.
19651988	A previously unknown zinc finger protein, DST, regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice via stomatal aperture control.	2009	Genes Dev	Abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity, lead to crop growth damage and a decrease in crop yields. Stomata control CO(2) uptake and optimize water use efficiency, thereby playing crucial roles in abiotic stress tolerance. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is an important signal molecule that induces stomatal closure. However, the molecular pathway that regulates the H(2)O(2) level in guard cells remains largely unknown. Here, we clone and characterize DST (drought and salt tolerance)-a previously unknown zinc finger transcription factor that negatively regulates stomatal closure by direct modulation of genes related to H(2)O(2) homeostasis-and identify a novel pathway for the signal transduction of DST-mediated H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure. Loss of DST function increases stomatal closure and reduces stomatal density, consequently resulting in enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice. These findings provide an interesting insight into the mechanism of stomata-regulated abiotic stress tolerance, and an important genetic engineering approach for improving abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
19607808	OsBWMK1 mediates SA-dependent defense responses by activating the transcription factor OsWRKY33.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in responses to various environmental stresses. In a previous study, we demonstrated that OsBWMK1, which localizes in the nucleus, mediates PR gene expression by activating the OsEREBP1 transcription factor, and that the constitutive expression of OsBWMK1 also enhances resistance against pathogen infections [Y.H. Cheong, B.C. Moon, J.K. Kim, C.Y. Kim, M.C. Kim, I.H. Kim, C.Y. Park, J.C. Kim, B.O. Park, S.C. Koo, H.W. Yoon, W.S. Chung, C.O. Lim, S.Y. Lee, M.J. Cho, BWMK1, rice mitogen-activated protein kinase, locates in the nucleus and mediates pathogenesis-related gene expression by activation of a transcription factor, Plant Physiol. 132 (2003) 1961--1972]. Here, we report that OsBWMK1 phosphorylates OsWRKY33, which binds to the W-box element (TTGACCA) in several PR gene promoters, thereby enhancing DNA-binding activity of the factor to its in vitro cognate binding site. Transient coexpression of OsBWMK1 and OsWRKY33 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates SA-dependent expression of the GUS-reporter gene driven by the W-box element and the PR1 promoter. Furthermore, the levels of SA and H(2)O(2) are elevated in 35S-OsBWMK1 transgenic plants that show HR-like cell death. Altogether, OsBWMK1 may mediate SA-dependent defense responses by activating the WRKY transcription factor in plants.
19825585	Fine mapping of Spr3, a locus for spreading panicle from African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.).	2008	Mol Plant	A CSSL (chromosome segment substitution line), SG-64, carrying a segment of chromosome 4 from African cultivated rice (CG-14) in the genetic background of var. Wuyujing-7 (japonica), showed a spreading panicle, which was different significantly from that of Wuyujing-7 with an erect compact panicle. The gene controlling a spreading panicle is referred to as Spr3, and is mapped on chromosome 4. To uncover the genetic basis of Spr3, a large F(2) population derived from cross between SG-64 and Wuyujing-7 was constructed for fine mapping of the Spr3 locus. The high-resolution linkage analysis revealed that the Spr3 locus was narrowed down to a 4.6-kb region. The delimited genomic DNA regions of Wuyujing-7 and CG-14 were sequenced and compared. Sequence mutations between Wuyujing-7 and CG-14 were evident and the candidate genes for the locus were predicted. Publicly available databases were searched for homologous cDNA sequences. However, any coding regions or other meaningful sequences for the Spr3 locus were not found within this delimited region. This result suggested that Spr3 is an unknown genetic factor in controlling the outspreading of the primary branches in rice inflorescence. In addition, NIL(Spr3) exhibited seed shattering. The formation of spreading panicle was accompanied by a few undesirable traits and the spreading panicle links with seed shattering suggest that the spreading panicle was likely lost during the domestication and selection for high seed productivity of cultivated rice.
15016817	A novel salt-tolerant L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, a halophytic wild rice: molecular cloning, bacterial overexpression, characterization, and functional introgression into tobacco-conferring salt tolerance phenotype.	2004	J Biol Chem	l-myo-Inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4, MIPS), an evolutionarily conserved enzyme protein, catalyzes the synthesis of inositol, which is implicated in a number of metabolic reactions in the biological kingdom. Here we report on the isolation of the gene (PINO1) for a novel salt-tolerant MIPS from the wild halophytic rice, Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka. Identity of the PINO1 gene was confirmed by functional complementation in a yeast inositol auxotrophic strain. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of PINO1 with that of the homologous gene from Oryza sativa L. (RINO1) revealed distinct differences in a stretch of 37 amino acids, between amino acids 174 and 210. Purified bacterially expressed PINO1 protein demonstrated a salt-tolerant character in vitro compared with the salt-sensitive RINO1 protein as with those purified from the native source or an expressed salt-sensitive mutant PINO1 protein wherein amino acids 174-210 have been deleted. Analysis of the salt effect on oligomerization and tryptophan fluorescence of the RINO1 and PINO1 proteins revealed that the structure of PINO1 protein is stable toward salt environment. Furthermore, introgression of PINO1 rendered transgenic tobacco plants capable of growth in 200-300 mm NaCl with retention of approximately 40-80% of the photosynthetic competence with concomitant increased inositol production compared with unstressed control. MIPS protein isolated from PINO1 transgenics showed salt-tolerant property in vitro confirming functional expression in planta of the PINO1 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a salt-tolerant MIPS from any source.
19018609	Non-monophyly of the woody bamboos (Bambuseae; Poaceae): a multi-gene region phylogenetic analysis of Bambusoideae s.s.	2009	J Plant Res	The taxonomy of Bambusoideae is in a state of flux and phylogenetic studies are required to help resolve systematic issues. Over 60 taxa, representing all subtribes of Bambuseae and related non-bambusoid grasses were sampled. A combined analysis of five plastid DNA regions, trnL intron, trnL-F intergenic spacer, atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer, rps16 intron, and matK, was used to study the phylogenetic relationships among the bamboos in general and the woody bamboos in particular. Within the BEP clade (Bambusoideae s.s., Ehrhartoideae, Pooideae), Pooideae were resolved as sister to Bambusoideae s.s. Tribe Bambuseae, the woody bamboos, as currently recognized were not monophyletic because Olyreae, the herbaceous bamboos, were sister to tropical Bambuseae. Temperate Bambuseae were sister to the group consisting of tropical Bambuseae and Olyreae. Thus, the temperate Bambuseae would be better treated as their own tribe Arundinarieae than as a subgroup of Bambuseae. Within the tropical Bambuseae, neotropical Bambuseae were sister to the palaeotropical and Austral Bambuseae. In addition, Melocanninae were found to be sister to the remaining palaeotropical and Austral Bambuseae. We discuss phylogenetic and morphological patterns of diversification and interpret them in a biogeographic context.
19543273	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice.	2009	Nat Cell Biol	Plants show distinct morphologies in different light conditions through a process called photomorphogenesis. A predominant feature of photomorphogenesis is the reduced growth of seedlings under light conditions compared with darkness. For this adaptive event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of cell elongation. However, it is not known whether additional pathways exist. Here, we describe a newly discovered pathway of light-modulated plant growth mediated by the halotolerance protein HAL3, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein involved in cell division. We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice seedlings by reducing the activity of Oryza sativa (Os) HAL3. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that OsHAL3 is structurally inactivated by light through photo-oxidation and by direct interaction with photons. In addition, the transcriptional expression of OsHAL3 is synergistically regulated by different light conditions. Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity. Our results uncover a new mechanism for light-regulated plant growth, namely, light not only inhibits cell elongation but also suppresses cell division through HAL3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant photomorphogenesis.
19506305	Evolutionary history of GS3, a gene conferring grain length in rice.	2009	Genetics	Unlike maize and wheat, where artificial selection is associated with an almost uniform increase in seed or grain size, domesticated rice exhibits dramatic phenotypic diversity for grain size and shape. Here we clone and characterize GS3, an evolutionarily important gene controlling grain size in rice. We show that GS3 is highly expressed in young panicles in both short- and long-grained varieties but is not expressed in leaves or panicles after flowering, and we use genetic transformation to demonstrate that the dominant allele for short grain complements the long-grain phenotype. An association study revealed that a C to A mutation in the second exon of GS3 (A allele) was associated with enhanced grain length in Oryza sativa but was absent from other Oryza species. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was elevated and there was a 95.7% reduction in nucleotide diversity (theta(pi)) across the gene in accessions carrying the A allele, suggesting positive selection for long grain. Haplotype analysis traced the origin of the long-grain allele to a Japonica-like ancestor and demonstrated introgression into the Indica gene pool. This study indicates a critical role for GS3 in defining the seed morphologies of modern subpopulations of O. sativa and enhances the potential for genetic manipulation of grain size in rice.
19470578	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice.	2009	J Cell Sci	MER3, a ZMM protein, is required for the formation of crossovers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis. Here, MER3, the first identified ZMM gene in a monocot, is characterized by map-based cloning in rice (Oryza sativa). The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects. Cytological analyses show that chiasma frequency is reduced dramatically in mer3 mutants and the remaining chiasmata distribute randomly among different pollen mother cells, implying possible coexistence of two kinds of crossover in rice. Immunocytological analyses reveal that MER3 only exists as foci in prophase I meiocytes. In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I. The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3. On the contrary, the absence of MER3 signal in pair2 mutants indicates that PAIR2 is essential for the loading and further function of MER3.
19556706	DNA polymorphism in the blast disease resistance gene Pita of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon and its related species.	2009	Genes Genet Syst	Intra-and interspecific DNA variations in the blast resistance gene Pita in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), cultivated rice (O. sativa), and two other related wild rice species (O. meridionalis and O. officinalis) were analyzed to elucidate the nucleotide polymorphism maintenance mechanisms and evolution of Pita in these species. Nucleotide diversity at silent sites of O. rufipogon Pita was 0.0101, an intermediate value relative to other O. rufipogon nuclear genes. A dimorphic pattern of nucleotide polymorphism was detected in the O. rufipogon Pita region. Inoculation of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae verified that the O. rufipogon Pita gene resides in a dimorphic sequence type. The resistance Pita allele had lower levels of variation than the susceptibility pita allele. A hypothesis of evolutionary relationships indicated that the amino acid mutation in the O. rufipogon Pita protein responsible for the difference between resistance and susceptibility occurred relatively recently. These results suggested that the resistance Pita originated from the susceptibility pita. Nucleotide diversity at replacement sites of the leucine-rich domain (LRD) of both the resistance and susceptibility O. rufipogon pita was low. In tests of neutrality, significantly negative values were detected for the LRD of O. rufipogon susceptibility pita. The low nucleotide diversity at replacement sites of the LRD of the susceptibility pita could be explained by purifying selection. Comparison of Pita between O. rufipogon and O. officinalis revealed an excess of nonconservative amino acid substitutions in the LRD, which could be related to the host-pathogen interaction.
14504241	A gene block causing cross-incompatibility hidden in wild and cultivated rice.	2003	Genetics	Unidirectional cross-incompatibility was detected in advanced generations of backcrossing between wild (Oryza rufipogon) and cultivated (O. sativa) rice strains. The near-isogenic line (NIL) of T65wx (Japonica type) carrying an alien segment of chromosome 6 from a wild strain gave a reduced seed setting only when crossed with T65wx as the male. Cytological observations showed that abortion of hybrid seeds occurred as a consequence of a failure of early endosperm development followed by abnormalities in embryo development. The genetic basis of cross-incompatibility reactions in the female and male was investigated by testcrosses using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that were established through dissecting the introgressed segments of wild and cultivated (Indica type) strains. The results revealed that the cross-incompatibility reaction was controlled by Cif in the female and by cim in the male. When the female plant with Cif was crossed with the male plant with cim, a failure of early endosperm development was observed in the hybrid zygotes. Among cultivars of O. sativa, cim was distributed predominantly in the Japonica type but not in the Indica type. In addition, a dominant suppressor, Su-Cif, which changes the reaction in the female from incompatible to compatible was proposed to present near the centromere of chromosome 6 of the Indica type. Further, the death of young F(1) zygotes was controlled by the parental genotypes rather than by the genotype of the hybrid zygote itself since all three genes acted sporophytically, which strongly suggests an involvement of parent-of-origin effects. We discuss the results in relation to the origin of a crossing barrier as well as their maintenance within the primary gene pool.
16539615	Genetic analysis of rice domestication syndrome with the wild annual species, Oryza nivara.	2006	New Phytol	With a small and sequenced genome, rice provides an excellent system for studying the genetics of cereal domestication. We conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of key domestication traits using an F2 population derived from a cross between the cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and the annual wild species, O. nivara. We found that the QTL of large phenotypic effects were targeted by domestication selection for effective harvest and planting, including a reduction in seed shattering and seed dormancy and the synchronization of seed maturation. Selection for higher yield was probably responsible for the fixation of mutations at a cluster of QTL on chromosome 7 and a few other chromosomal locations that could have substantially improved plant architecture and panicle structure, resulting in fewer erect tillers and longer and more highly branched panicles in cultivated rice. In comparison with the wild perennial species, O. rufipogon, rice domestication from O. nivara would have involved QTL with a greater degree of chromosomal co-localization and required little genetic change associated with life history or mating system transitions. The genetic analyses of domestication traits with both wild relatives will open opportunities for the improvement of rice cultivars utilizing natural germplasm.
19493335	Identification and expression analysis of WRKY transcription factor genes in canola (Brassica napus L.) in response to fungal pathogens and hormone treatments.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Members of plant WRKY transcription factor families are widely implicated in defense responses and various other physiological processes. For canola (Brassica napus L.), no WRKY genes have been described in detail. Because of the economic importance of this crop, and its evolutionary relationship to Arabidopsis thaliana, we sought to characterize a subset of canola WRKY genes in the context of pathogen and hormone responses.

RESULTS: In this study, we identified 46 WRKY genes from canola by mining the expressed sequence tag (EST) database and cloned cDNA sequences of 38 BnWRKYs. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the conserved WRKY domain amino acid sequences, which demonstrated that BnWRKYs can be divided into three major groups. We further compared BnWRKYs to the 72 WRKY genes from Arabidopsis and 91 WRKY from rice, and we identified 46 presumptive orthologs of AtWRKY genes. We examined the subcellular localization of four BnWRKY proteins using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and we observed the fluorescent green signals in the nucleus only.The responses of 16 selected BnWRKY genes to two fungal pathogens, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Alternaria brassicae, were analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Transcript abundance of 13 BnWRKY genes changed significantly following pathogen challenge: transcripts of 10 WRKYs increased in abundance, two WRKY transcripts decreased after infection, and one decreased at 12 h post-infection but increased later on (72 h). We also observed that transcript abundance of 13/16 BnWRKY genes was responsive to one or more hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine, BAP) and the defense signaling molecules jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET). We compared these transcript expression patterns to those previously described for presumptive orthologs of these genes in Arabidopsis and rice, and observed both similarities and differences in expression patterns.

CONCLUSION: We identified a set of 13 BnWRKY genes from among 16 BnWRKY genes assayed, that are responsive to both fungal pathogens and hormone treatments, suggesting shared signaling mechanisms for these responses. This study suggests that a large number of BnWRKY proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of defense-related genes in response to fungal pathogens and hormone stimuli.
19495721	Identification of a novel gene ef7 conferring an extremely long basic vegetative growth phase in rice.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	A late heading-time mutant line, HS276, which was induced by gamma-irradiation of seeds of the japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Gimbozu, exhibits an extremely long basic vegetative growth phase (BVP). A genetic analysis using the F(2) population from the cross between HS276 and Gimbozu revealed that the late heading of HS276 is governed by a single recessive mutant gene. The subsequent analysis on heading responses of HS276 and Gimbozu to four photoperiods (12, 13, 14, and 15 h) and to the photoperiodic transfer treatment from a short photoperiod to a long photoperiod revealed that the mutant gene confers an extremely long BVP and increases photoperiod sensitivity under long photoperiod (14 and 15 h). The BVP durations of HS276 and Gimbozu were estimated at 30.1 and 16.0 days, respectively; the mutant gene, compared with its wild type allele, elongates the duration of BVP by 14 days. Linkage analysis showed that the mutant gene is located in the 129 kb region between the two INDEL markers, INDELAP0399_6 and INDELAP3487_2, on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 6. None of the other BVP genes are located in this region; therefore, we declared this a newly detected mutant gene and designated it ef7. A recently established program to breed rice suitable for low latitudes, where short photoperiodic conditions continue throughout the year, aims to develop varieties with extremely long BVPs and weak photoperiod sensitivities; the mutant gene ef7, therefore, will be quite useful in these programs because it confers an extremely long BVP and little enhances photoperiod sensitivity under short photoperiod.
19502382	Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	OsRac1, a member of the Rac/Rop GTPase family, plays important roles as a molecular switch in rice innate immunity, and the active form of OsRac1 functions in the plasma membrane (PM). To study the precise localization of OsRac1 in the PM and its possible association with other signaling components, we performed proteomic analysis of DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) isolated from rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged constitutively active (CA) OsRac1. DRMs are regions of the PM that are insoluble after Triton X-100 treatment under cold conditions and are thought to be involved in various signaling processes in animal, yeast and plant cells. We identified 192 proteins in DRMs that included receptor-like kinases (RLKs) such as Xa21, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)-type disease resistance proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, syntaxin, NADPH oxidase, a WD-40 repeat family protein and various GTP-binding proteins. Many of these proteins have been previously identified in the DRMs isolated from other plant species, and animal and yeast cells, validating the methods used in our study. To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment. These results suggest that OsRac1-mediated innate immunity is associated with DRMs in the PM.
19506306	Identification of a new rice blast resistance gene, Pid3, by genomewide comparison of paired nucleotide-binding site--leucine-rich repeat genes and their pseudogene alleles between the two sequenced rice genomes.	2009	Genetics	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases. The two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), indica and japonica, have shown obvious differences in rice blast resistance, but the genomic basis that underlies the difference is not clear. We performed a genomewide comparison of the major class of resistant gene family, the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family, between 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) with a focus on their pseudogene members. We found great differences in either constitution or distribution of pseudogenes between the two genomes. According to this comparison, we designed the PCR-based molecular markers specific to the Nipponbare NBS-LRR pseudogene alleles and used them as cosegregation markers for blast susceptibility in a segregation population from a cross between a rice blast-resistant indica variety and a susceptible japonica variety. Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, Pid3, in the indica variety, Digu. The allelic Pid3 loci in most of the tested japonica varieties were identified as pseudogenes due to a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2208 starting from the translation initiation site. However, this mutation was not found in any of the tested indica varieties, African cultivated rice varieties, or AA genome-containing wild rice species. These results suggest that the pseudogenization of Pid3 in japonica occurred after the divergence of indica and japonica.
19508361	Identification of quantitative trait loci for rice quality in a population of chromosome segment substitution lines.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	The demand for high quality rice represents a major issue in rice production. The primary components of rice grain quality include appearance, eating, cooking, physico-chemical, milling and nutritional qualities. Most of these traits are complex and controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), so the genetic characterization of these traits is more difficult than that of traits controlled by a single gene. The detection and genetic identification of QTLs can provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying quality traits. Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) are effective tools used in mapping QTLs. In this study, we constructed 154 CSSLs from backcross progeny (BC(3)F(2)) derived from a cross between 'Koshihikari' (an Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica variety) as the recurrent parent and 'Nona Bokra' (an O. sativa L. ssp. indica variety) as the donor parent. In this process, we carried out marker-assisted selection by using 102 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and simple sequence repeat markers covering most of the rice genome. Finally, this set of CSSLs was used to identify QTLs for rice quality traits. Ten QTLs for rice appearance quality traits were detected and eight QTLs concerned physico-chemical traits. These results supply the foundation for further genetic studies and breeding for the improvement of grain quality.
19515790	ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE2 acts with ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE1 in a root ultraviolet B-sensing pathway.	2009	Plant Physiol	Ultraviolet B light (UV-B; 280-320 nm) perception and signaling are well-known phenomena in plants, although no specific UV-B photoreceptors have yet been identified. We previously reported on the root UV-B sensitive1 (rus1) mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which display a block to development under very-low-fluence-rate UV-B (<0.1 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) after the seedling emerges from the seed. Here, we report the analysis and cloning of the rus2-1 mutation in Arabidopsis. The phenotype of rus2-1 mutant seedlings is virtually indistinguishable from the phenotype of rus1 seedlings. A map-based approach was used to clone RUS2. RUS2 encodes a domain of unknown function (DUF647)-containing protein that is homologous to the RUS1 protein. rus1-2 rus2-1 double mutant seedlings have the same phenotype as both rus1 and rus2 single mutants, suggesting that the two genes work in the same pathway. RUS2-Green Fluorescent Protein shows a similar expression pattern as that of RUS1-Green Fluorescent Protein, and RUS1 and RUS2 proteins interact physically in yeast. This protein-protein interaction depends on the DUF647 domain, and site-directed mutagenesis identified specific residues in DUF647 that are required for both protein-protein interaction and physiological function. Six RUS genes are found in Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa), and moss (Physcomitrella patens), and one RUS member, RUS3, is conserved in plants and animals. Our results demonstrate that RUS2 works with RUS1 in a root UV-B-sensing pathway that plays a vital role in Arabidopsis early seedling morphogenesis and development.
19519802	Homologous recombination-mediated knock-in targeting of the MET1a gene for a maintenance DNA methyltransferase reproducibly reveals dosage-dependent spatiotemporal gene expression in rice.	2009	Plant J	Although homologous recombination-promoted knock-in targeting to monitor the expression of a gene by fusing a reporter gene with its promoter is routine practice in mice, gene targeting to modify endogenous genes in flowering plants remains in its infancy. In the knock-in targeting, the junction sequence between a reporter gene and an endogenous target promoter can be designed properly, and transgenic plants carrying an identical and desired knock-in allele can be repeatedly obtained. By employing a reproducible gene-targeting procedure with positive-negative selection in rice, we were able to obtain fertile transgenic knock-in plants with the promoterless GUS reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase fused with the endogenous promoter of MET1a, one of two rice MET1 genes encoding a maintenance DNA methyltransferase. All of the primary (T(0)) transgenic knock-in plants obtained were found to carry only one copy of GUS, with the anticipated structure in the heterozygous condition, and no ectopic events associated with gene targeting could be detected. We showed the reproducible, dosage-dependent and spatiotemporal expression of GUS in the selfed progenies of independently isolated knock-in targeted plants. The results in knock-in targeted plants contrast sharply with the results in transgenic plants with the MET1a promoter-fused GUS reporter gene integrated randomly in the genome: clear interindividual variation of GUS expression was observed among independently obtained plants bearing the randomly integrated transgenes. As our homologous recombination-mediated gene-targeting strategy with positive-negative selection is, in principle, applicable to modify any endogenous gene, knock-in targeting would facilitate basic and applied plant research.
19521518	The effect of the crosstalk between photoperiod and temperature on the heading-date in rice.	2009	PLoS One	Photoperiod and temperature are two important environmental factors that influence the heading-date of rice. Although the influence of the photoperiod on heading has been extensively reported in rice, the molecular mechanism for the temperature control of heading remains unknown. This study reports an early heading mutant derived from tissue culture lines of rice and investigates the heading-date of wild type and mutant in different photoperiod and temperature treatments. The linkage analysis showed that the mutant phenotype cosegregated with the Hd1 locus. Sequencing analysis found that the mutant contained two insertions and several single-base substitutions that caused a dramatic reduction in Hd1mRNA levels compared with wild type. The expression patterns of Hd1 and Hd3a were also analyzed in different photoperiod and temperature conditions, revealing that Hd1 mRNA levels displayed similar expression patterns for different photoperiod and temperature treatments, with high expression levels at night and reduced levels in the daytime. In addition, Hd1 displayed a slightly higher expression level under long-day and low temperature conditions. Hd3a mRNA was present at a very low level under low temperature conditions regardless of the day-length. This result suggests that suppression of Hd3a expression is a principle cause of late heading under low temperature and long-day conditions.
19523506	Sequence and expression analysis of the C3HC4-type RING finger gene family in rice.	2009	Gene	C3HC4-type RING finger genes comprise a large family in the plant kingdom and play important roles in various physiologic processes of plant life. In this study, we identified 29 C3HC4-type RING finger family genes in rice (Oryza sativa) by database search. Motif analysis revealed the presence of three conserved motifs with unknown functions within the predicted proteins. Promoter analysis found 196 cis-elements in the 2-kb upstream regions of these genes, including a stress-responsive element, a hormone-responsive element, and a light-responsive element. In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis of these genes has been performed using microarray data obtained from 27 tissues or organs of three rice genotypes, Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and Shanyou 63. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that five C3HC4-type RING finger genes are preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues or organs such as stamen, panicle, and endosperm. Expression analysis of C3HC4-type RING finger genes under abiotic stresses suggests that twelve genes are differentially regulated by hormones or stress in rice seedlings. These results would be useful for elucidating their roles in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice plant.
19529831	Evaluation of seven function-known candidate genes for their effects on improving drought resistance of transgenic rice under field conditions.	2009	Mol Plant	Many stress responsive genes have been reported with an effect on improving stress resistance in model plants under greenhouse conditions. Towards identification of genes for drought resistance breeding, seven well documented genes (CBF3, SOS2, NCED2, NPK1, LOS5, ZAT10, and NHX1) in stress resistance were selected in this study and transformed into rice cultivar Zhonghua 11 under the control of constitutive promoter Actin1 and stress-inducible promoter of a rice HVA22 homolog, and transgenic rice were tested for drought resistance under field conditions. A total of 1598 independent transgenic T0 plants were generated. The percentages of single copy and expression of the transgenes were 36.7% and 57.6%, respectively. For each gene construct, 30 T1 families with expression of transgene were selected for drought resistance testing at the reproductive stage in field, and 10 of them were tested in PVC pipes with a defined stress protocol at the same stage. Relative yield and relative spikelet fertility were used as two major criteria to evaluate drought resistance performance because significantly decreased yield was observed in the T1 generation. Transgenic families of eight constructs (HVA22P:CBF3, HVA22P:NPK1, Actin1:LOS5, HVA22P:LOS5, Actin1:ZAT10, HVA22P:ZAT10, Actin1:NHX1, and HVA22P:NHX1) showed significantly higher RY than wild-type (WT) under both drought stress field and PVC tube conditions. Transgenic families of 9 constructs (HVA22P:SOS2 and CBF3, LOS5, ZAT10, and NHX1 by both promoters) showed significantly higher relative spikelet fertility than WT in the field or PVC pipes. In the field drought resistance testing of T2 families derived from the T1 families with relatively lower yield decrease, transgenic families of seven constructs (HVA22P:CBF3, Actin1:NPK1, HVA22P:NPK1, Actin1:LOS5, HVA22P:LOS5, Actin1:ZAT10, and HVA22P:ZAT10) showed significantly higher yield per plant than WT, and families of nine constructs (Actin1:CBF3, HVA22P:CBF3, HVA22P:SOS2, HVA22P:NPK1, Actin1:LOS5, HVA22P:LOS5, Actin1:ZAT10, HVA22P:ZAT10, and Actin1:NHX1) had higher spikelet fertility than WT. In general, LOS5 and ZAT10 showed relatively better effect than the other five genes in improving drought resistance of transgenic rice under field conditions. The results and experience obtained from this study could be a useful reference for drought resistance engineering in rice.
19534828	Exploring transcriptional signalling mediated by OsWRKY13, a potential regulator of multiple physiological processes in rice.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice transcription regulator OsWRKY13 influences the functioning of more than 500 genes in multiple signalling pathways, with roles in disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development.

RESULTS: To determine the putative transcriptional regulation mechanism of OsWRKY13, the putative cis-acting elements of OsWRKY13-influenced genes were analyzed using the whole genome expression profiling of OsWRKY13-activated plants generated with the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array. At least 39 transcription factor genes were influenced by OsWRKY13, and 30 of them were downregulated. The promoters of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes were overrepresented with W-boxes for WRKY protein binding, whereas the promoters of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes were enriched with cis-elements putatively for binding of MYB and AP2/EREBP types of transcription factors. Consistent with the distinctive distribution of these cis-elements in up- and downregulated genes, nine WRKY genes were influenced by OsWRKY13 and the promoters of five of them were bound by OsWRKY13 in vitro; all seven differentially expressed AP2/EREBP genes and six of the seven differentially expressed MYB genes were suppressed by in OsWRKY13-activated plants. A subset of OsWRKY13-influenced WRKY genes were involved in host-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OsWRKY13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors. WRKY proteins may play important roles in the monitoring of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes and genes involved in pathogen-induced defence responses, whereas MYB and AP2/EREBP proteins may contribute most to the control of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes.
19541604	A metastable DWARF1 epigenetic mutant affecting plant stature in rice.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Epigenetic mutations confer heritable changes in gene expression that are not due to changes in the underlying sequence of the DNA. We identified a spontaneous rice mutant, Epi-d1, that shows a metastable dwarf phenotype. The phenotype is mitotically and meiotically inheritable and corresponds to the metastable epigenetic silencing of the DWARF1 (D1) gene. The silenced state is correlated with repressive histone and DNA methylation marks in the D1 promoter region but is not associated with DNA sequence alterations. Compared with other known epigenetic silenced loci in plants such as paramutable maize alleles and silent Arabidopsis genes, the Epi-d1 silencing phenomenon shows a high level of bidirectional metastable mutability. Epigenetic alleles such as Epi-d1 could thus provide for rapid adaptation under selective conditions.
19542179	d14, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Recent studies using highly branched mutants of pea, Arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, act as a new hormone class, or its biosynthetic precursors, in inhibiting shoot branching. Here, we provide evidence that DWARF14 (D14) inhibits rice tillering and may act as a new compo-nent of the strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition pathway. The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants d10 and d3, respectively. The d10-1 d14-1 double mutant is phenotypically indistinguishable from the d10-1 and d14-1 single mutants, consistent with the idea that D10 and D14 function in the same pathway. However, unlike with d10, the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones. In addition, the d14 mutant contained a higher level of 2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol than the wild type. Positional cloning revealed that D14 encodes a protein of the alpha/beta-fold hydrolase superfamily, some members of which play a role in metabolism or signaling of plant hormones. We propose that D14 functions downstream of strigolactone synthesis, as a component of hormone signaling or as an enzyme that participates in the conversion of strigolactones to the bioactive form.
19542298	The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species.	2009	Plant Physiol	Pentavalent methylated arsenic (As) species such as monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)] are used as herbicides or pesticides, and can also be synthesized by soil microorganisms or algae through As methylation. The mechanism of MMA(V) and DMA(V) uptake remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier). Here we investigated whether these two transporters also mediate the uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V). MMA(V) was partly reduced to trivalent MMA(III) in rice roots, but only MMA(V) was translocated to shoots. DMA(V) was stable in plants. The rice lsi1 mutant lost about 80% and 50% of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi2 mutation had little effect. The short-term uptake kinetics of MMA(V) can be described by a Michaelis-Menten plus linear model, with the wild type having 3.5-fold higher V(max) than the lsi1 mutant. The uptake kinetics of DMA(V) were linear with the slope being 2.8-fold higher in the wild type than the lsi1 mutant. Heterologous expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of MMA(V) but not DMA(V), possibly because of a very limited uptake of the latter. Uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V) by wild-type rice was increased as the pH of the medium decreased, consistent with an increasing proportion of the undissociated species. The results demonstrate that Lsi1 mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots.
19546322	Deletion in a quantitative trait gene qPE9-1 associated with panicle erectness improves plant architecture during rice domestication.	2009	Genetics	Rice plant architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major determinant in high productivity. Panicle erectness is the preferred plant architecture in japonica rice, but the molecular mechanism underlying domestication of the erect panicle remains elusive. Here we report the map-based cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, qPE9-1, which plays an integral role in regulation of rice plant architecture including panicle erectness. The R6547 qPE9-1 gene encodes a 426-amino-acid protein, homologous to the keratin-associated protein 5-4 family. The gene is composed of three Von Willebrand factor type C domains, one transmembrane domain, and one 4-disulfide-core domain. Phenotypic comparisons of a set of near-isogenic lines and transgenic lines reveal that the functional allele (qPE9-1) results in drooping panicles, and the loss-of-function mutation (qpe9-1) leads to more erect panicles. In addition, the qPE9-1 locus regulates panicle and grain length, grain weight, and consequently grain yield. We propose that the panicle erectness trait resulted from a natural random loss-of-function mutation for the qPE9-1 gene and has subsequently been the target of artificial selection during japonica rice breeding.
19556707	The spatial expression patterns of DROOPING LEAF orthologs suggest a conserved function in grasses.	2009	Genes Genet Syst	The DROOPING LEAF (DL) gene regulates carpel specification in the flower and midrib formation in the leaf in Oryza sativa (rice). Loss-of-function mutations in the dl locus cause homeotic transformation of carpels into stamens and lack of midrib, resulting in the drooping leaf phenotype. DL is a member of the YABBY gene family and is closely related to the CRABS CLAW (CRC) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The function of Arabidopsis CRC, however, differs from that of rice DL: it is responsible for nectary development and is partially involved in carpel identity. Thus, genes related to DL/CRC seem to have functionally diversified during angiosperm evolution. To assess the conservation of DL function in related species, here we examined the in situ expression patterns of DL orthologs in three grass species, i.e., maize, wheat and sorghum, which is assigned to subfamilies different from Ehrhartoideae including O. sativa. The results clearly show that the temporal and spatial expression patterns of DL orthologs in the three species are identical to those of rice DL in both flower and leaf development, suggesting that DL-related genes are functionally conserved within the grass family. It is likely that DL may have been recruited to carpel specification and midrib formation within the lineage of the grass family after divergence of their ancestor from that of eudicots.
19556711	Phytochrome dependent quantitative control of Hd3a transcription is the basis of the night break effect in rice flowering.	2009	Genes Genet Syst	A short exposure to light during relative night (night break; NB) delays flowering in the short day plant rice. NB acts by downregulating Heading date 3a (Hd3a) expression. Because phytochrome B mutants do not respond to NB and their flowering time is not affected even under NB conditions, phyB is required for the suppression of Hd3a expression. The effect of NB is quantitatively controlled by light quality and by either light intensity or duration. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these interactions are poorly understood. Here, we examine the roles of phytochromes in the regulation of Hd3a transcription under NB conditions using monochromatic red, far-red and blue light. Red and blue light downregulated Hd3a expression, but far-red light NB did not. The effect of red light NB on Hd3a is dependent on photon fluence and is restored by subsequent far-red light irradiation. Our results suggest that quantitative effect of light on flowering in rice NB is mediated by the regulation of Hd3a transcription by phyB.
19561057	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	The FCA protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis. It contains two RNA-binding domains and a WW domain. The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain. We previously characterized a rice gene, OsFCA, which was homologous to FCA. Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8. The FY protein is associated with the 3' end processing machinery in Arabidopsis. Thus, we examined interactions between OsFY and the rice homologs (OsCstF-50, -64 and -77) of the AtCstF-50, -64 and -77 proteins. We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64. Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice.
19561334	Dynamic bridges--a calponin-domain kinesin from rice links actin filaments and microtubules in both cycling and non-cycling cells.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Interaction and cross-talk between microtubules and actin microfilaments are important for the cell axis and polarity during plant cell growth and development, but little is known about the molecular components of this interaction. Plant kinesins with a calponin-homology domain (KCHs) were recently identified and associated with a putative role in microtubule-microfilament cross-linking. KCHs belong to a distinct branch of the minus end-directed kinesin subfamily and so far have only been identified in land plants including the mosses. Here we report the identification of a new KCH from rice (Oryza sativa), OsKCH1, and show that OsKCH1 is associated with cortical microtubules and actin microfilaments in vivo. Furthermore, OsKCH1 is shown to bind to micro-tubules and actin microfilaments in vitro in a domain-dependent way. Additionally, this unique type of kinesin is shown to oligomerize both in vivo and in vitro. These findings are discussed with respect to a general role for KCHs as linkers between actin filaments and microtubules in both cell elongation and division.
19566645	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains at least six genes exclusively with an SPX (SYG1/PHO81/XPR1) domain at the N-terminal, designated as OsSPX1-6. Here we report the diverse expression patterns of the OsSPX genes in different tissues and their responses to Pi-starvation. Among them, five genes, OsSPX1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsive to Pi-starvation in shoots and/or in roots. The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein. OsSPX1 regulates OsSPX2, 3 and 5 at the transcription level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to Pi-starvation. Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi-sufficiency. OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation. Our results suggest that OsSPX1 may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of OsSPX2, 3 and 5. OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2. Our results also indicate that OsSPX3 is involved in plant tolerance to Pi-starvation stress.
19567376	Overexpression of BiP has inhibitory effects on the accumulation of seed storage proteins in endosperm cells of rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Seed storage proteins are specifically and highly synthesized during seed maturation and are deposited into protein bodies (PBs) via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The accumulation process is mediated by ER chaperones such as luminal binding protein (BiP) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). To examine the role of ER chaperones and the relationship between ER chaperones and levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins, we generated transgenic rice plants in which the rice BiP and PDI genes were overexpressed in an endosperm-specific manner under the control of the rice seed storage protein glutelin promoter. The seed phenotype of the PDI-overexpressing transformant was almost identical to that of the wild type, whereas overexpression of BiP resulted in transgenic rice seed that displayed an opaque phenotype with floury and shrunken features. In the BiP-overexpressing line, the levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins and starch contents were significantly lower compared with the wild type. Interestingly, overproduction of BiP in the endosperm of the transformant not only altered the morphological structure of ER-derived PB-I, but also generated unusual new PB-like structures composed of a high electron density matrix containing glutelin and BiP and a low electron density matrix containing prolamins. Notably, polysomes were attached around the aberrant PB-like structures, indicating that this aberrant structure is an ER-derived PB-I derivative. These results suggested that the PB-like structure may be formed in the ER lumen, resulting in inhibition of translation, folding and transport of seed proteins.
19570592	Expression of an endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanase in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid and ethephon in rice seedlings.	2009	J Plant Physiol	We isolated two rice endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanase genes, denoted OsEGL1 and OsEGL2, which encoded proteins that shared 64% amino acid sequence identity. Both the OsEGL1 and OsEGL2 genes were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli to produce functional proteins. Purified OsEGL1 and OsEGL2 proteins hydrolyzed (1,3;1,4)-beta-glucans, but not (1,3;1,6)-beta-linked or (1,3)-beta-linked glucopolysaccharides nor carboxymethyl cellulose, similar to previously characterized grass endo-(1,3;1,4)-beta-glucanases. RNA blot analysis revealed that the OsEGL1 gene is expressed constitutively not only in young roots of rice seedlings, but also in mature roots of adult rice plants. Little or no expression of the OsEGL2 gene was observed in all tissues or treatments tested, but database and RT-PCR analysis indicated it is expressed in ripening panicle. In rice seedling leaves, OsEGL1 gene expression significantly increased in response to methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, ethephon and mechanical wounding. Mechanical wounding also increased the leaf elongation rate in rice seedlings by 16% relative to that of control seedlings at day 4 after treatment. The increase in the leaf elongation rate of rice seedlings treated under mechanical wounding was concomitant with an increase in OsEGL1 expression levels in seedling leaves.
19574435	Identification and characterization of maize and barley Lsi2-like silicon efflux transporters reveals a distinct silicon uptake system from that in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Silicon (Si) uptake has been extensively examined in rice (Oryza sativa), but it is poorly understood in other gramineous crops. We identified Low Silicon Rice 2 (Lsi2)-like Si efflux transporters from two important gramineous crops: maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Both maize and barley Lsi2 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed Si efflux transport activity. Furthermore, barley Lsi2 was able to recover Si uptake in a rice mutant defective in Si efflux. Maize and barley Lsi2 were only expressed in the roots. Expression of maize and barley Lsi2 was downregulated in response to exogenously applied Si. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the ability of roots to absorb Si and the expression levels of Lsi2 in eight barley cultivars, suggesting that Lsi2 is a key Si transporter in barley. Immunostaining showed that maize and barley Lsi2 localized only at the endodermis, with no polarity. Protein gel blot analysis indicated that maize and barley Lsi2 localized on the plasma membrane. The unique features of maize and barley Si influx and efflux transporters, including their cell-type specificity and the lack of polarity of their localization in Lsi2, indicate that these crops have a different Si uptake system from that in rice.
19587102	Structural and enzymatic characterization of Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing hydrophobic glycosides and (1-&gt;3)- and (1-&gt;2)-linked disaccharides.	2009	Plant Physiol	Glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases play roles in many processes in plants, such as chemical defense, alkaloid metabolism, hydrolysis of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides, phytohormone regulation, and lignification. However, the functions of most of the 34 GH1 gene products in rice (Oryza sativa) are unknown. Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase representing a previously uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster of GH1, was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli. Os3BGlu6 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-beta-d-fucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 67 mm(-1) s(-1)), pNP-beta-d-glucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 6.2 mm(-1) s(-1)), and pNP-beta-d-galactoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.6 mm(-1)s(-1)) efficiently but had little activity toward other pNP glycosides. It also had high activity toward n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside and beta-(1-->3)- and beta-(1-->2)-linked disaccharides and was able to hydrolyze apigenin beta-glucoside and several other natural glycosides. Crystal structures of Os3BGlu6 and its complexes with a covalent intermediate, 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside, and a nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside, were solved at 1.83, 1.81, and 1.80 A resolution, respectively. The position of the covalently trapped 2-F-glucosyl residue in the enzyme was similar to that in a 2-F-glucosyl intermediate complex of Os3BGlu7 (rice BGlu1). The side chain of methionine-251 in the mouth of the active site appeared to block the binding of extended beta-(1-->4)-linked oligosaccharides and interact with the hydrophobic aglycone of n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside. This correlates with the preference of Os3BGlu6 for short oligosaccharides and hydrophobic glycosides.
19588119	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of spd6, responsible for small panicle and dwarfness in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Identification of genes in rice that affect production and quality is necessary for improving the critical global food source. CSSL58, a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) containing a chromosome segment of Oryza rufipogon in the genetic background of the indica cultivar Teqing showed significantly smaller panicles, fewer grains per panicle, smaller grains and dwarfness compared with the recurrent parent Teqing. Genetic analysis of the BC(4)F(1) and BC(4)F(2) generations, derived from a cross between CSSL58 and Teqing, showed that these traits are controlled by the recessive gene spd6, which mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6. Fine mapping and high-resolution linkage analysis using 24,120 BC(4)F(3) plants and markers flanking spd6 were carried out, and the gene was localized to a 22.4 kb region that contains four annotated genes according to the genome sequence of japonica Nipponbare. Phenotypic evaluation of the nearly isogenic line NIL(spd6) revealed that spd6 from wild rice has pleiotropic effects on panicle number per plant, grain size, grain weight, grain number per panicle and plant height, suggesting that this gene might play an important role in the domestication of rice. The discovery of spd6 may ultimately be useful for the design and breeding of crops with high grain yield and quality.
19593540	Comparison of the starch synthesis genes between maize and rice: copies, chromosome location and expression divergence.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Gene duplication and divergence are important evolutionary processes. It has been suggested that a whole genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the Gramineae, predating its divergence, and a second WGD occurred in maize during its evolution. In this study we compared the fate of the genes involved in the core pathway of starch biosynthesis following the ancient and second WGDs in maize and rice. In total, thirty starch synthesis genes were detected in the maize genome, which covered all the starch synthesis gene families encoded by 27 genes in rice. All of these genes, except ZmGBSSIIb and ZmBEIII, are anchored within large-scale synteny blocks of rice and maize chromosomes. Previous findings and our results indicate that two of the current copies of many starch synthesis genes (including AGPL, AGPS, GBSS, SSII, SSIII, and BEII) probably arose from the ancient WGD in the Gramineae and are still present in the maize and rice genome. Furthermore, two copies of at least six genes (AGPS1, SSIIb, SSIIIb, GBSSII, BEI, and ISA3) appear to have been retained in the maize genome after its second WGD, although complete coding regions were only detected among the duplicate sets of AGPS1, SSIIb, and SSIIIb. The expression patterns of the remaining duplicate sets of starch synthesis genes (AGPL1/2, AGPS1/2, SSIIa/b, SSIIIa/b, GBSSI/II, and BEIIa/b) differ in their expression and could be classified into two groups in maize. The first group is mainly expressed in the endosperm, whereas the second is expressed in other organs and the early endosperm development. The four duplicate sets of ZmGBSSII, ZmSSIIb, ZmSSIIIb and AGPS1, which arose from the second WGD diverged in gene structure and/or expression patterns in maize. These results indicated that some duplicated starch synthesis genes were remained, whereas others diverged in gene structure and/or expression pattern in maize. For most of the duplicated genes, one of the copies has disappeared in the maize genome after the WGD and the subsequent "diploidization".
19603144	Dwarf 88, a novel putative esterase gene affecting architecture of rice plant.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait that affects grain yield. We characterized a tillering dwarf mutant d88 derived from Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Lansheng treated with EMS. The mutant had excessive shorter tillers and smaller panicles and seeds compared to the wild-type. A reduction in number and size of parenchyma cells around stem marrow cavity as well as a delay in the elongation of parenchyma cells caused slender tillers and dwarfism in the d88 mutant. The D88 gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a putative esterase. The gene was expressed in most rice organs, with especially high levels in the vascular tissues. The mutant carried a nucleotide substitution in the first exon of the gene that led to the substitution of arginine for glycine, which presumably disrupted the functionally conserved N-myristoylation domain of the protein. The function of the gene was confirmed by complementation test and antisense analysis. D88, thus, represents a new category of genes that regulates cell growth and organ development and consequently plant architecture. The potential relationship between the tiller formation associated genes and D88 is discussed and future identification of the substrate for D88 may lead to the characterization of new pathways regulating plant development.
19604382	Tissue culture-induced transpositional activity of mPing is correlated with cytosine methylation in rice.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: mPing is an endogenous MITE in the rice genome, which is quiescent under normal conditions but can be induced towards mobilization under various stresses. The cellular mechanism responsible for modulating the activity of mPing remains unknown. Cytosine methylation is a major epigenetic modification in most eukaryotes, and the primary function of which is to serve as a genome defense system including taming activity of transposable elements (TEs). Given that tissue-culture is capable of inducing both methylation alteration and mPing transposition in certain rice genotypes, it provides a tractable system to investigate the possible relationship between the two phenomena.

RESULTS: mPing transposition and cytosine methylation alteration were measured in callus and regenerated plants in three rice (ssp. indica) genotypes, V14, V27 and R09. All three genotypes showed transposition of mPing, though at various frequencies. Cytosine methylation alteration occurred both at the mPing-flanks and at random loci sampled globally in callus and regenerated plants of all three genotypes. However, a sharp difference in the changing patterns was noted between the mPing-flanks and random genomic loci, with a particular type of methylation modification, i.e., CNG hypermethylation, occurred predominantly at the mPing-flanks. Pearson's test on pairwise correlations indicated that mPing activity is positively correlated with specific patterns of methylation alteration at random genomic loci, while the element's immobility is positively correlated with methylation levels of the mPing's 5'-flanks. Bisulfite sequencing of two mPing-containing loci showed that whereas for the immobile locus loss of CG methylation in the 5'-flank was accompanied by an increase in CHG methylation, together with an overall increase in methylation of all three types (CG, CHG and CHH) in the mPing-body region, for the active locus erasure of CG methylation in the 5'-flank was not followed by such a change.

CONCLUSION: Our results documented that tissue culture-induced mPing activity in rice ssp. indica is correlated with alteration in cytosine methylation patterns at both random genomic loci and the elements' flanks, while the stability of mPing positively correlates with enhanced methylation levels of both the flanks and probably the elements per se. Thus, our results implicate a possible role of cytosine methylation in maintaining mPing stability under normal conditions, and in releasing the element's activity as a consequence of epigenetic perturbation in a locus-specific manner under certain stress conditions.
19605414	Involvement of C-22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids in auxin-induced lamina joint bending in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice lamina joint is ideal material for investigating the activity of brassinosteroids (BRs) and auxin because of its high sensitivity to these compounds. Using a series of rice BR biosynthetic and receptor mutants, we conducted lamina joint tests to elucidate the mechanism of cross-talk between BR and auxin signaling in lamina joint bending. In BR biosynthetic mutants d2 and brd1, which are defective in C-23 hydroxylase and C-6 oxidase, respectively, the lamina joint response to auxin was significantly higher than that of wild-type plants. The other BR-biosynthetic mutants, brd2, osdwarf4 and d11, which are defective in C-22-hydroxylated BRs, showed less or no response to auxin. These results suggest that C-22-hydroxylated BRs are involved in auxin-induced lamina joint bending. The results were supported by the observation that inhibition of the hyper-response to auxin in d2 was reduced by treatment with brassinazole, which inhibits the function of DWARF4, the C-22 hydroxylase. In d61, which is defective in OsBRI1, a possible BR receptor in rice, the bending angle of the lamina joint in response to auxin and C-22-hydroxylated 6-deoxoBRs was nearly the same as that in wild-type plants. This implies that C-22-hydroxylated BRs function in auxin signaling independently of OsBRI1. From these observations, we propose that C-22-hydroxylated BRs participate in auxin signaling via a novel OsBRI1-independent signaling pathway.
19609685	The ankyrin repeat gene family in rice: genome-wide identification, classification and expression profiling.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Ankyrin repeat (ANK) containing proteins comprise a large protein family. Although many members of this family have been implicated in plant growth, development and signal transduction, only a few ANK genes have been reported in rice. In this study, we analyzed the structures, phylogenetic relationship, genome localizations and expression profiles of 175 ankyrin repeat genes identified in rice (OsANK). Domain composition analysis suggested OsANK proteins can be classified into ten subfamilies. Chromosomal localizations of OsANK genes indicated nine segmental duplication events involving 17 genes and 65 OsANK genes were involved in tandem duplications. The expression profiles of 158 OsANK genes were analyzed in 24 tissues covering the whole life cycle of two rice genotypes, Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Sixteen genes showed preferential expression in given tissues compared to all the other tissues in Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Nine genes were preferentially expressed in stamen of 1 day before flowering, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in pollination and fertilization. Expression data of OsANK genes were also obtained with tissues of seedlings subjected to three phytohormone (NAA, GA3 and KT) and light/dark treatments. Eighteen genes showed differential expression with at least one phytohormone treatment while under light/dark treatments, 13 OsANK genes showed differential expression. Our data provided a very useful reference for cloning and functional analysis of members of this gene family in rice.
19618278	Identification and expression profiling analysis of TIFY family genes involved in stress and phytohormone responses in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	The TIFY family is a novel plant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of diverse plant-specific biologic processes, such as development and responses to phytohormones, in Arabidopsis. However, there is limited information about this family in monocot species. This report identifies 20 TIFY genes in rice, the model monocot species. Sequence analysis indicated that rice TIFY proteins have conserved motifs beyond the TIFY domain as was previously shown in Arabidopsis. On the basis of their protein structures, members of the TIFY family can be divided into two groups. Transcript level analysis of OsTIFY genes in tissues and organs revealed different tempo-spatial expression patterns, suggesting that expression and function vary by stage of plant growth and development. Most of the OsTIFY genes were predominantly expressed in leaf. Nine OsTIFY genes were responsive to jasmonic acid and wounding treatments. Interestingly, almost all the OsTIFY genes were responsive to one or more abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and low temperature. Over-expression of OsTIFY11a, one of the stress-inducible genes, resulted in significantly increased tolerance to salt and dehydration stresses. These results suggest that the OsTIFY family may have important roles in response to abiotic stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the functions of the genes in the OsTIFY family.
19619287	Identification of an extensive gene cluster among a family of PPOs in Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) using a large insert BAC library.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in plants is a trait with potential economic, agricultural and environmental impact. In relation to the food industry, PPO-induced browning causes unacceptable discolouration in fruit and vegetables: from an agriculture perspective, PPO can protect plants against pathogens and environmental stress, improve ruminant growth by increasing nitrogen absorption and decreasing nitrogen loss to the environment through the animal's urine. The high PPO legume, red clover, has a significant economic and environmental role in sustaining low-input organic and conventional farms. Molecular markers for a range of important agricultural traits are being developed for red clover and improved knowledge of PPO genes and their structure will facilitate molecular breeding.

RESULTS: A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising 26,016 BAC clones with an average 135 Kb insert size, was constructed from Trifolium pratense L. (red clover), a diploid legume with a haploid genome size of 440-637 Mb. Library coverage of 6-8 genome equivalents ensured good representation of genes: the library was screened for polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes.Two single copy PPO genes, PPO4 and PPO5, were identified to add to a family of three, previously reported, paralogous genes (PPO1-PPO3). Multiple PPO1 copies were identified and characterised revealing a subfamily comprising three variants PPO1/2, PPO1/4 and PPO1/5. Six PPO genes clustered within the genome: four separate BAC clones could be assembled onto a predicted 190-510 Kb single BAC contig.

CONCLUSION: A PPO gene family in red clover resides as a cluster of at least 6 genes. Three of these genes have high homology, suggesting a more recent evolutionary event. This PPO cluster covers a longer region of the genome than clusters detected in rice or previously reported in tomato. Full-length coding sequences from PPO4, PPO5, PPO1/5 and PPO1/4 will facilitate functional studies and provide genetic markers for plant breeding.
19622530	Amyloplast division progresses simultaneously at multiple sites in the endosperm of rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	The amyloplast, a form of differentiated plastid, proliferates in sink tissues, where it synthesizes and stores starch granules. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for amyloplast division and development. The rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm provides an excellent model system for studying molecular mechanisms involved in amyloplast division and starch synthesis. We compared amyloplast division processes in the endosperm of wild type and a mutant of ARC5, a member of the dynamin superfamily. Plant growth and fertility of arc5 were not significantly different from the wild type. Unlike binary fission of chloroplast in the leaf, small amyloplasts in the endosperm of wild type divide simultaneously at multiple sites, generating a beads-on-a-string structure. In addition, large amyloplasts divide by budding-type division, giving rise to small amyloplasts attached to their surfaces. ARC5 and FtsZ2-1 fused to fluorescent proteins were targeted to the constriction sites in dividing amyloplasts. Both the loss of function of ARC5 and overexpression of ARC5 fusion proteins in the endosperm did not produce spherical amyloplasts with increased diameter, but produced either fused amyloplasts with thick connections or pleomorphic types, suggesting that proper stoichiometry between ARC5 and other components in the amyloplast division machinery is necessary for the completion of the late stage of amyloplast division. The size distribution of starch granules purified from arc5 was shifted to small and the starch gelatinization peak temperature was significantly higher than for wild-type starch, suggesting that amyloplast division processes have a significant effect on starch synthesis.
19635799	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice.	2009	J Biol Chem	Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.
19648232	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are involved in many developmental processes and regulate many subsets of downstream genes throughout the plant kingdom. However, little is known about the BR signal transduction and response network in monocots. To identify novel BR-related genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we monitored the transcriptomic response of the brassinosteroid deficient1 (brd1) mutant, with a defective BR biosynthetic gene, to brassinolide treatment. Here, we describe a novel BR-induced rice gene BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1), encoding a helix-loop-helix protein. Rice plants overexpressing BU1 (BU1:OX) showed enhanced bending of the lamina joint, increased grain size, and resistance to brassinazole, an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis. In contrast to BU1:OX, RNAi plants designed to repress both BU1 and its homologs displayed erect leaves. In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1. These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1. Furthermore, expression analyses showed that BU1 is expressed in several organs including lamina joint, phloem, and epithelial cells in embryos. These results indicate that BU1 may participate in some other unknown processes modulated by BR in rice.
19649188	Function of alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G protein in brassinosteroid response of rice plants.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (G alpha) is involved in a broad range of aspects of the brassinosteroid (BR) response, such as the enhancement of lamina bending. However, it has been suggested from epistatic analysis of d1 and d61, which are mutants deficient for G alpha and the BR receptor BRI1, that G alpha and BRI1 may function via distinct pathways in many cases. In this study, we investigated further the genetic interaction between G alpha and BRI1. We report the analysis of transformants of T65d1 and T65d1/d61-7 into which were introduced a constitutively active form of G alpha, Q223L. The application of 24-epi-brassinolide (24-epiBL) to T65d1 expressing Q223L still resulted in elongation of the coleoptile and, in fact, it was enhanced over the wild-type plant (WT) level in a concentration dependent manner. In T65d1/d61-7 expressing Q223L, the seed size was enlarged over that of d61-7 due to activation of G alpha. These results suggest that Q223L is able to augment the BR response in response to 24-epiBL and also that Q223L functions independently of BRI1 in the process of determining seed morphology, given that Q223L was functional in the BRI1-deficient mutant, d61-7.
19653105	Overexpression of a rice gene encoding a small C2 domain protein OsSMCP1 increases tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Plant growth and crop production are limited by environmental stress. We used a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing rice full-length cDNAs to isolate the rice genes that improve the tolerance of plants to environmental stress. By sowing T2 seeds of the transgenic lines under conditions of salinity stress, the salt-tolerant line R07047 was isolated. It expressed a rice gene, OsSMCP1, which encodes a small protein with a single C2 domain, a Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-targeting domain. Retransformation of wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that OsSMCP1 is responsible for conferring the salt tolerance. It is particularly interesting that R07047 and newly constructed OsSMCP1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to high salinity but also to osmotic, dehydrative, and oxidative stresses. Furthermore, R07047 showed improved resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. The OsSMCP1 expression in rice is constitutive. Particle-bombardment-mediated transient expression analysis revealed that OsSMCP1 is targeted to plastids in rice epidermal cells. It induced overexpression of several nuclear encoded genes, including the stress-associated genes, in transgenic Arabidopsis. No marked morphological change or growth retardation was observed in R07047 or retransformants. For molecular breeding to improve the tolerance of crops against environmental stress, OsSMCP1 is a promising candidate.
19656341	Silencing OsHI-LOX makes rice more susceptible to chewing herbivores, but enhances resistance to a phloem feeder.	2009	Plant J	The jasmonic acid (JA) pathway plays a central role in plant defense responses against insects. Some phloem-feeding insects also induce the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, thereby suppressing the plant's JA response. These phenomena have been well studied in dicotyledonous plants, but little is known about them in monocotyledons. We cloned a chloroplast-localized type 2 13-lipoxygenase gene of rice, OsHI-LOX, whose transcripts were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Niaparvata lugens, as well as by mechanical wounding and treatment with JA. Antisense expression of OsHI-LOX (as-lox) reduced SSB- or BPH-induced JA and trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) levels, improved the larval performance of SBB as well as that of the rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and increased the damage caused by SSB and LF larvae. In contrast, BPH, a phloem-feeding herbivore, showed a preference for settling and ovipositing on WT plants, on which they consumed more and survived better than on as-lox plants. The enhanced resistance of as-lox plants to BPH infestation correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced H(2)O(2) and SA, as well as with increased hypersensitive response-like cell death. These results imply that OsHI-LOX is involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis, and plays contrasting roles in controlling rice resistance to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores. The observation that suppression of JA activity results in increased resistance to an insect indicates that revision of the generalized plant defense models in monocotyledons is required, and may help develop novel strategies to protect rice against insect pests.
19656904	Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is required for epidermal cell death in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	In rice (Oryza sativa) adventitious root primordia are formed at the nodes as part of normal development. Upon submergence of rice plants, adventitious roots emerge from the nodes preceded by death of epidermal cells above the root primordia. Cell death is induced by ethylene and mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Pharmacological experiments indicated that epidermal cell death was dependent on signaling through G proteins. Treatment with GTP-gamma-S induced epidermal cell death, whereas GDP-beta-S partially inhibited ethylene-induced cell death. The dwarf1 (d1) mutant of rice has repressed expression of the Galpha subunit RGA1 of heterotrimeric G protein. In d1 plants, cell death in response to ethylene and H(2)O(2) was nearly completely abolished, indicating that signaling through Galpha is essential. Ethylene and H(2)O(2) were previously shown to alter gene expression in epidermal cells that undergo cell death. Transcriptional regulation was not generally affected in the d1 mutant, indicating that altered gene expression is not sufficient to trigger cell death in the absence of Galpha. Analysis of genes encoding proteins related to G protein signaling revealed that four small GTPase genes, two GTPase-activating protein genes, and one GDP dissociation inhibitor gene but not RGA1 were differentially expressed in epidermal cells above adventitious roots, indicating that Galpha activity is regulated posttranscriptionally.
19664599	Rice histone deacetylase genes display specific expression patterns and developmental functions.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important in plant gene expression. Here we show that the expression of rice HDAC genes is both tissue/organ-specific, and most of them are responsive to drought or salt stresses. Over-expression of several rice HDACs did not produce any visible phenotype, whereas down-regulation of a few HDAC genes affected different developmental aspects. Specifically, down-regulation of HDA703 by amiRNA reduced rice peduncle elongation and fertility, while inactivation of a closely related homolog HDA710 by RNAi affected vegetative growth. HDA704 RNAi altered plant height and flag leaf morphology. Down-regulation of HDT702 led to the production of narrowed leaves and stems. These data suggest that rice HDAC genes may have divergent developmental functions compared with closely related homologs in Arabidopsis.
19666483	ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The developing endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa, Os) synthesizes a large amount of storage proteins on the rough (r)ER. The major storage proteins, glutelins and prolamins, contain either intra or intermolecular disulfide bonds, and oxidative protein folding is necessary for the sorting of the proteins to the protein bodies. Here, we investigated an electron transfer pathway for the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the rER of the rice endosperm, focusing on the roles of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, OsEro1. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that N-glycosylated OsEro1 is localized to the rER membrane in the subaleurone cells, and that targeting of OsEro1 to the rER membrane depends on the N-terminal region from Met-1 to Ser-55. The RNAi knockdown of OsERO1 inhibited the formation of native disulfide bonds in the glutelin precursors (proglutelins) and promoted aggregation of the proglutelins through nonnative intermolecular disulfide bonds in the rER. Inhibition of the formation of native disulfide bonds was also observed in the seeds of the esp2 mutant, which lacks protein disulfide isomerase-like (PDIL)1;1, but shows enhanced OsEro1 expression. We detected the generation of H(2)O(2) in the rER of the WT subaleurone cells, whereas the rER-derived H(2)O(2) levels decreased markedly in EM49 homozygous mutant seeds, which have fewer sulfhydryl groups than the WT seeds. Together, we propose that the formation of native disulfide bonds in proglutelins depends on an electron transfer pathway involving OsEro1 and OsPDIL.
19669727	High-resolution mapping of two rice brown planthopper resistance genes, Bph20(t) and Bph21(t), originating from Oryza minuta.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice. Wild species of rice are a valuable source of resistance genes for developing resistant cultivars. A molecular marker-based genetic analysis of BPH resistance was conducted using an F(2) population derived from a cross between an introgression line, 'IR71033-121-15', from Oryza minuta (Accession number 101141) and a susceptible Korean japonica variety, 'Junambyeo'. Resistance to BPH (biotype 1) was evaluated using 190 F(3) families. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and two significant digenic epistatic interactions between marker intervals were identified for BPH resistance. One QTL was mapped to 193.4-kb region located on the short arm of chromosome 4, and the other QTL was mapped to a 194.0-kb region on the long arm of chromosome 12. The two QTLs additively increased the resistance to BPH. Markers co-segregating with the two resistance QTLs were developed at each locus. Comparing the physical map positions of the two QTLs with previously reported BPH resistance genes, we conclude that these major QTLs are new BPH resistance loci and have designated them as Bph20(t) on chromosome 4 and Bph21(t) on chromosome 12. This is the first report of BPH resistance genes from the wild species O. minuta. These two new genes and markers reported here will be useful to rice breeding programs interested in new sources of BPH resistance.
19675157	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	A great number of plants synchronize flowering with day length. In rice (Oryza sativa), photoperiod is the primary environmental cue that triggers flowering. Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma-irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 (SE5) gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. s73 mutant plants show a number of alterations in the characteristic diurnal expression patterns of master genes involved in photoperiodic control of flowering, resulting in up-regulation of the floral integrator Heading date3a (Hd3a). Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants. Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds indicated that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression. The data also indicate that SE5 confers photoperiodic sensitivity through regulation of Hd1. These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1 flowering pathways.
19682283	A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos.	2009	Plant J	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) plays a critical role in many aspects of plant growth and development; however, complete pathways of biosynthesis, localization and many aspects of functions of IAA in rice remain unclear. Here, we report the analysis of a rice tryptophan- (Trp-) and IAA-deficient mutant, tryptophan deficient dwarf1 (tdd1), which is embryonic lethal because of a failure to develop most organs during embryogenesis. Regenerated tdd1 plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes: dwarfing, narrow leaves, short roots and abnormal flowers. TDD1 encodes a protein homologous to anthranilate synthase beta-subunit, which catalyses the first step of the Trp biosynthesis pathway and functions upstream of Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis. TDD1-uidA and DR5-uidA expression overlapped at many sites in WT plants but was lacking in tdd1, indicating that TDD1 is involved in auxin biosynthesis. Both Trp and IAA levels in flowers and embryos were much lower in tdd1 than in wild type (WT). Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of tdd1 are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency. In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation.
19684243	A serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferase is required for synthesis of antimicrobial compounds and disease resistance in oats.	2009	Plant Cell	Serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) proteins have recently emerged as a new group of plant acyltransferases. These enzymes share homology with peptidases but lack protease activity and instead are able to acylate natural products. Several SCPL acyltransferases have been characterized to date from dicots, including an enzyme required for the synthesis of glucose polyesters that may contribute to insect resistance in wild tomato (Solanum pennellii) and enzymes required for the synthesis of sinapate esters associated with UV protection in Arabidopsis thaliana. In our earlier genetic analysis, we identified the Saponin-deficient 7 (Sad7) locus as being required for the synthesis of antimicrobial triterpene glycosides (avenacins) and for broad-spectrum disease resistance in diploid oat (Avena strigosa). Here, we report on the cloning of Sad7 and show that this gene encodes a functional SCPL acyltransferase, SCPL1, that is able to catalyze the synthesis of both N-methyl anthraniloyl- and benzoyl-derivatized forms of avenacin. Sad7 forms part of an operon-like gene cluster for avenacin synthesis. Oat SCPL1 (SAD7) is the founder member of a subfamily of monocot-specific SCPL proteins that includes predicted proteins from rice (Oryza sativa) and other grasses with potential roles in secondary metabolism and plant defense.
19686374	Premature tapetum degeneration: a major cause of abortive pollen development in photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (PSGMS) rice (Oryza sativa L.), a natural mutant found in the rice cultivar Nongken 58, is very useful for the development of hybrid rice cultivars. Despite its widespread use in breeding programs, the initial stage of the abortive development of PSGMS rice and the possible cytological mechanisms of pollen abortion have not been determined. In the present study, a systematic cytological comparison of the anther development of PSGMS rice with its normal fertile counterpart is conducted. The results show that pollen abortion in PSGMS rice first occurs before the pollen mother cell (PMC) stage, and continues during the entire process of pollen development until pollen degradation. The abortive process was closely associated with the abnormal behavior of the tapetum. Although tapetum degeneration in PSGMS rice initiates already at the PMC stage, it proceeds slowly and does not complete until the breakdown of the pollen. Such cytological observations were supported by the results of the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay, which detects DNA fragmentation resulting from programmed cell death (PCD), indicating that the premature tapetum degeneration is in the process of PCD.
19688299	Molecular characterization, expression pattern, and function analysis of the OsBC1L family in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	COBRA-like proteins play important roles in cell expansion and cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. In rice, a COBRA-like gene, BRITTLE CULM1 (BC1), has been identified as a regulator controlling the culm mechanical strength. Analysis of the rice genome indicated that BC1 belongs to an 11-member multigene family, termed the OsBC1L family in this study. Based on sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis, the OsBC1L family comprises two main subgroups. Expression patterns examined by microarray and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that OsBC1L genes exhibit universal or specific expression patterns. Through T-DNA or Tos17 insertion mutant lines, the functions of six OsBC1L family members have been examined by investigating the phenotype variations of knockout mutants under normal growth conditions. Results suggest that the OsBC1L genes perform a range of functions and participate in various developmental processes in rice.
19690613	Protein-protein interactions of tandem affinity purified protein kinases from rice.	2009	PLoS One	Eighty-eight rice (Oryza sativa) cDNAs encoding rice leaf expressed protein kinases (PKs) were fused to a Tandem Affinity Purification tag (TAP-tag) and expressed in transgenic rice plants. The TAP-tagged PKs and interacting proteins were purified from the T1 progeny of the transgenic rice plants and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Forty-five TAP-tagged PKs were recovered in this study and thirteen of these were found to interact with other rice proteins with a high probability score. In vivo phosphorylated sites were found for three of the PKs. A comparison of the TAP-tagged data from a combined analysis of 129 TAP-tagged rice protein kinases with a concurrent screen using yeast two hybrid methods identified an evolutionarily new rice protein that interacts with the well conserved cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) protein complex.
19696351	Loss of function of a proline-containing protein confers durable disease resistance in rice.	2009	Science	Blast disease is a devastating fungal disease of rice, one of the world's staple foods. Race-specific resistance to blast disease has usually not been durable. Here, we report the cloning of a previously unknown type of gene that confers non-race-specific resistance and its successful use in breeding. Pi21 encodes a proline-rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal-binding domain and putative protein-protein interaction motifs. Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide.
19697141	A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA4 affects protein abundance in the plasma membrane and results in abnormal cell wall biosynthesis in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Cellulose synthase (CESA) is a critical catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase complex responsible for glucan chain elongation. Our knowledge about how CESA functions is still very limited. Here, we report the functional characterization of a rice mutant, brittle culm11, that shows growth retardation and dramatically reduced plant strength. Map-based cloning revealed that all the mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in OsCESA4 (G858R), a highly conserved residue at the end of the fifth transmembrane domain. The aberrant secondary cell wall of the mutant plants is attributed to significantly reduced cellulose content, abnormal secondary wall structure of sclerenchyma cells, and overall altered wall composition, as detected by chemical analyses and immunochemical staining. Importantly, we have found that this point mutation decreases the abundance of OsCESA4 in the plasma membrane, probably due to a defect in the process of CESA complex secretion. The data from our biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological analyses indicate that this residue is critical for maintaining the normal level of CESA proteins in the plasma membrane.
19700558	A pair of allelic WRKY genes play opposite roles in rice-bacteria interactions.	2009	Plant Physiol	Although allelic diversity of genes has been reported to play important roles in different physiological processes, information on allelic diversity of defense-responsive genes in host-pathogen interactions is limited. Here, we report that a pair of allelic genes, OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2, which encode proteins with a 10-amino acid difference, play opposite roles in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against bacterial pathogens. Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), bacterial streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola (Xoc), and fungal blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea are devastating diseases of rice worldwide. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing plants showed increased susceptibility and OsWRKY45-1-knockout plants showed enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing plants showed increased susceptibility to Xoo and Xoc. Interestingly, both OsWRKY45-1- and OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance to M. grisea. OsWRKY45-1-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid and induced expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes, while OsWRKY45-2-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of jasmonic acid but not salicylic acid and induced expression of another subset of defense-responsive genes. These results suggest that both OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 are positive regulators in rice resistance against M. grisea, but the former is a negative regulator and the latter is a positive regulator in rice resistance against Xoo and Xoc. The opposite roles of the two allelic genes in rice-Xoo interaction appear to be due to their mediation of different defense signaling pathways.
19700562	SAUR39, a small auxin-up RNA gene, acts as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis and transport in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	The phytohormone auxin plays a critical role for plant growth by regulating the expression of a set of genes. One large auxin-responsive gene family of this type is the small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) genes, although their function is largely unknown. The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild-type plants. The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region. The transgenic plants had a lower auxin level and a reduced polar auxin transport as well as the down-regulation of some putative auxin biosynthesis and transporter genes. Biochemical analysis also revealed that transgenic plants had lower chlorophyll content, higher levels of anthocyanin, abscisic acid, sugar, and starch, and faster leaf senescence compared with wild-type plants at the vegetative stage. Most of these phenomena have been shown to be negatively correlated with auxin level and transport. Transcript profiling revealed that metabolic perturbations in overexpresser plants were largely due to transcriptional changes of genes involved in photosynthesis, senescence, chlorophyll production, anthocyanin accumulation, sugar synthesis, and transport. The lower growth and yield of overexpresser plants was largely recovered by exogenous auxin application. Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport.
19701685	Systematic identification of X1-homologous genes reveals a family involved in stress responses in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	X1-homologous genes (XHS) encode plant-specific proteins containing three major domains (XH, XS, zf-XS), but their functions are largely unknown. We report the systematic identification and characterization of XHS genes in the rice genome. Eleven putative XHS protein sequences (OXHS1-11) were identified in the sequenced genome of Oryza sativa japonica cv. Nipponbare, and these sequences, along with other plant XHS homologues, were classified into five subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. Distinct diversification of the XHS proteins occurred between monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants. The OXHS family has diverse exon-intron structures and organizations of putative domains and motifs. The OXHS proteins showed no transactivation activity, and no interaction between the XH domain and the XS domain in yeast. Four representative OXHS proteins were targeted to cytoplasm, which contradicts the previous speculation that XHS proteins are putative transcription factors. All the OXHS genes are predominantly expressed in floral organs, and some are expressed in a wide range of tissues or organs in indica rice Minghui 63. Nine OXHS genes are responsive to at least one of the abiotic stresses including drought, salt, cold, and abscisic acid treatment. Over-expression of one stress-responsive gene OXHS2 in rice resulted in reduced tolerance to salt and drought stresses. These results suggest that the OXHS family may be functionally diversified and some members of this family may play important roles in regulating stress tolerance in rice.
19702667	A lineage-specific centromere retrotransposon in Oryza brachyantha.	2009	Plant J	Most eukaryotic centromeres contain large quantities of repetitive DNA, such as satellite repeats and retrotransposons. Unlike most transposons in plant genomes, the centromeric retrotransposon (CR) family is conserved over long evolutionary periods among a majority of the grass species. CR elements are highly concentrated in centromeres, and are likely to play a role in centromere function. In order to study centromere evolution in the Oryza (rice) genus, we sequenced the orthologous region to centromere 8 of Oryza sativa from a related species, Oryza brachyantha. We found that O. brachyantha does not have the canonical CRR (CR of rice) found in the centromeres of all other Oryza species. Instead, a new Ty3-gypsy (Metaviridae) retroelement (FRetro3) was found to colonize the centromeres of this species. This retroelement is found in high copy numbers in the O. brachyantha genome, but not in other Oryza genomes, and based on the dating of long terminal repeats (LTRs) of FRetro3 it was amplified in the genome in the last few million years. Interestingly, there is a high level of removal of FRetro3 based on solo-LTRs to full-length elements, and this rapid turnover may have played a role in the replacement of the canonical CRR with the new element by active deletion. Comparison with previously described ChIP cloning data revealed that FRetro3 is found in CENH3-associated chromatin sequences. Thus, within a single lineage of the Oryza genus, the canonical component of grass centromeres has been replaced with a new retrotransposon that has all the hallmarks of a centromeric retroelement.
19702669	Comparative analysis of complete orthologous centromeres from two subspecies of rice reveals rapid variation of centromere organization and structure.	2009	Plant J	Centromeres are sites for assembly of the chromosomal structures that mediate faithful segregation at mitosis and meiosis. This function is conserved across species, but the DNA components that are involved in kinetochore formation differ greatly, even between closely related species. To shed light on the nature, evolutionary timing and evolutionary dynamics of rice centromeres, we decoded a 2.25-Mb DNA sequence covering the centromeric region of chromosome 8 of an indica rice variety, 'Kasalath' (Kas-Cen8). Analysis of repetitive sequences in Kas-Cen8 led to the identification of 222 long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon elements and 584 CentO satellite monomers, which account for 59.2% of the region. A comparison of the Kas-Cen8 sequence with that of japonica rice 'Nipponbare' (Nip-Cen8) revealed that about 66.8% of the Kas-Cen8 sequence was collinear with that of Nip-Cen8. Although the 27 putative genes are conserved between the two subspecies, only 55.4% of the total LTR-retrotransposon elements in 'Kasalath' had orthologs in 'Nipponbare', thus reflecting recent proliferation of a considerable number of LTR-retrotransposons since the divergence of two rice subspecies of indica and japonica within Oryza sativa. Comparative analysis of the subfamilies, time of insertion, and organization patterns of inserted LTR-retrotransposons between the two Cen8 regions revealed variations between 'Kasalath' and 'Nipponbare' in the preferential accumulation of CRR elements, and the expansion of CentO satellite repeats within the core domain of Cen8. Together, the results provide insights into the recent proliferation of LTR-retrotransposons, and the rapid expansion of CentO satellite repeats, underlying the dynamic variation and plasticity of plant centromeres.
19706531	The origin and evolution of fragrance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Fragrance in the grain is one of the most highly valued grain quality traits in rice, yet the origin and evolution of the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (BADH2) underlying this trait remains unclear. In this study, we identify eight putatively nonfunctional alleles of the BADH2 gene and show that these alleles have distinct geographic and genetic origins. Despite multiple origins of the fragrance trait, a single allele, badh2.1, is the predominant allele in virtually all fragrant rice varieties today, including the widely recognized Basmati and Jasmine types. Haplotype analysis allowed us to establish a single origin of the badh2.1 allele within the Japonica varietal group and demonstrate the introgression of this allele from Japonica to Indica. Basmati-like accessions were nearly identical to the ancestral Japonica haplotype across a 5.3-Mb region flanking BADH2 regardless of their fragrance phenotype, demonstrating a close evolutionary relationship between Basmati varieties and the Japonica gene pool. These results clarify the relationships among fragrant rice varieties and challenge the traditional assumption that the fragrance trait arose in the Indica varietal group.
19706555	Phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red/far-red light in rice.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytochromes are believed to be solely responsible for red and far-red light perception, but this has never been definitively tested. To directly address this hypothesis, a phytochrome triple mutant (phyAphyBphyC) was generated in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and its responses to red and far-red light were monitored. Since rice only has three phytochrome genes (PHYA, PHYB and PHYC), this mutant is completely lacking any phytochrome. Rice seedlings grown in the dark develop long coleoptiles while undergoing regular circumnutation. The phytochrome triple mutants also show this characteristic skotomorphogenesis, even under continuous red or far-red light. The morphology of the triple mutant seedlings grown under red or far-red light appears completely the same as etiolated seedlings, and they show no expression of the light-induced genes. This is direct evidence demonstrating that phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red and far-red light, at least during rice seedling establishment. Furthermore, the shape of the triple mutant plants was dramatically altered. Most remarkably, triple mutants extend their internodes even during the vegetative growth stage, which is a time during which wild-type rice plants never elongate their internodes. The triple mutants also flowered very early under long day conditions and set very few seeds due to incomplete male sterility. These data indicate that phytochromes play an important role in maximizing photosynthetic abilities during the vegetative growth stage in rice.
19711051	Transpositional activation of mPing in an asymmetric nuclear somatic cell hybrid of rice and Zizania latifolia was accompanied by massive element loss.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	We have reported previously that the most active miniature inverted terminal repeat transposable element (MITE) of rice, mPing, was transpositionally mobilized in several rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an introgressive hybridization between rice and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.). To further study the phenomenon of hybridization-induced mPing activity, we undertook the present study to investigate the element's behavior in a highly asymmetric somatic nuclear hybrid (SH6) of rice and Z. latifolia, which is similar in genomic composition to that of the RILs, though probably contains more introgressed alien chromatins from the donor species than the RILs. We found that mPing, together with its transposase-donor, Pong, underwent rampant transpositional activation in the somatic hybrid (SH6). Because possible effects of protoplast isolation and cell culture can be ruled out, we attribute the transpositional activation of mPing and Pong in SH6 to the process of asymmetric somatic hybridization, namely, one-step introgression of multiple chromatin segments of the donor species Z. latifolia into the recipient rice genome. A salient feature of mPing transposition in the somatic hybrid is that the element's activation was accompanied by massive loss of its original copies, i.e., abortive transpositions, which was not observed in previously reported cases of mPing activity. These data not only corroborated our earlier finding that wide hybridization and introgression may trigger transpositional activation of otherwise quiescent transposable elements, but also suggest that transpositional mobilization of a MITE like mPing can be accompanied by dramatic reduction of its original copy numbers under certain conditions, thus provide novel insights into the dynamics of MITEs in the course of genome evolution.
19714920	Differential proteomic analysis of apoplastic proteins during initial phase of salt stress in rice.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The plant cell apoplast, which consists of all the compartments beyond the plasma membrane, is implicated in a variety of functions during plant growth and development as well as in plant defence responses to stress conditions. To evaluate the role of apoplastic proteins in initial phase of salt stress, a 2-DE based differential proteomics approach has been used to identify apoplastic salt response proteins. Six salt response proteins have been identified, among them, an apoplastic protein OsRMC, which belongs to cysteine-rich repeat receptor like protein kinase subfamily but without the kinase domain, has shown drastically increased abundance in response to salt stress during the initial phase. Our results show, OsRMC negative regulates the salt tolerance of rice plants. These results indicated that plant apoplastic proteins may have important role in plant salt stress response signal pathway.
19717618	Biochemical insights on degradation of Arabidopsis DELLA proteins gained from a cell-free assay system.	2009	Plant Cell	The phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA) regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development. GA responses are triggered by the degradation of DELLA proteins, which function as repressors in GA signaling pathways. Recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) have implied that the degradation of DELLA proteins occurred via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we developed an Arabidopsis cell-free system to recapitulate DELLA protein degradation in vitro. Using this cell-free system, we documented that Lys-29 of ubiquitin is the major site for ubiquitin chain formation to mediate DELLA protein degradation. We also confirmed the specific roles of GA receptors and multisubunit E3 ligase components in regulating DELLA protein degradation. In addition, blocking DELLA degradation with a PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor in our cell-free assay suggested that degradation of DELLA proteins required protein Ser/Thr dephosphorylation activity. Furthermore, our data revealed that the LZ domain of Arabidopsis DELLA proteins is essential for both their stability and activity. Thus, our in vitro degradation system provides biochemical insights into the regulation of DELLA protein degradation. This in vitro assay system could be widely adapted for dissecting cellular signaling pathways in which regulated proteolysis is a key recurrent theme.
19720627	Differences in expression of the RBCS multigene family and rubisco protein content in various rice plant tissues at different growth stages.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Four out of five members of the RBCS multigene family (OsRBCS2-OsRBCS5) were highly expressed in leaf blades of rice (Oryza sativa L.) irrespective of plant growth stage, whereas accumulation of all RBCS mRNAs in leaf sheaths, roots and developing spikelets was quite low. A highly positive correlation was observed between total RBCS and RBCL mRNA levels and Rubisco content at their maxima, irrespective of tissue and growth stage. The results indicate that the total RBCS mRNA level may be a primary determinant for maximal Rubisco protein content and that Rubisco gene expression is well coordinated through the whole life of rice.
19723240	Quantitative trait Loci for panicle layer uniformity identified in doubled haploid lines of rice in two environments.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	Uniformity of stem height in rice directly affects crop yield potential and appearance, and has become a vital index for rice improvement. In the present study, a doubled haploid (DH) population, derived from a cross between japonica rice Chunjiang 06 and indica rice TN1 was used to analyze the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for three related traits of panicle-layer-uniformity; that is, the tallest panicle height, the lowest panicle height and panicle layer disuniformity in two locations: Hangzhou (HZ) and Hainan (HN). A total of 16 QTLs for three traits distributed on eight chromosomes were detected in two different environments. Two QTLs, qTPH-4 and qTPH-8 were co-located with the QTLs for qLPH-4 and qLPH-8, which were only significant in the HZ environment, whereas the qTPH-6 and qLPH-6 located at the same interval were only significant in the HN environment. Two QTLs, qPLD-10-1 and qPLD-10-2, were closely linked to qTPH-10, and they might have been at the same locus. One QTL, qPLD-3, was detected in both environments, explaining more than 23% of the phenotypic variations. The CJ06 allele of qPLD-3 could increase the panicle layer disuniformity by 9.23 and 4.74 cm in the HZ and HN environments. Except for qPLD-3, almost all other QTLs for the same trait were detected only in one environment, indicating that these three traits were dramatically affected by environmental factors. The results may be useful for elucidation of the molecular mechanism of panicle-layer-uniformity and marker assisted breeding for super-rice.
19723241	The OsDHODH1 gene is involved in salt and drought tolerance in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	In the present paper, we identified and cloned OsDHODH1 encoding a putative cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in rice. Expression analysis indicated that OsDHODH1 is upregulated by salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold. By prokaryotic expression, we determined the enzymatic activity of OsDHODH1 and found that overproduction of OsDHODH1 significantly improved the tolerance of Escherichia coli cells to salt and osmotic stresses. Overexpression of the OsDHODH1 gene in rice increased the DHODH activity and enhanced plant tolerance to salt and drought stresses as compared with wild type and OsDHODH1-antisense transgenic plants. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in plant stress response and that OsDHODH1 could be used in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought.
19723247	Correlation and quantitative trait loci analyses of total chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of rice (Oryza sativa) under water stress and well-watered conditions.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	In order to explore the relevant molecular genetic mechanisms of photosynthetic rate (PR) and chlorophyll content (CC) in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we conducted a series of related experiments using a population of recombinant inbred lines (Zhenshan97B x IRAT109). We found a significant correlation between CC and PR (R= 0.19**) in well-watered conditions, but no significant correlation during water stress (r= 0.08). We detected 13 main quantitative trait loci (QTLs) located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10, which were associated with CC, including six QTLs located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during water stress, and seven QTLs located on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 in well-watered conditions. These QTLs explained 47.39% of phenotypic variation during water stress and 56.19% in well-watered conditions. We detected four main QTLs associated with PR; three of them (qPR2, qPR10, qPR11) were located on chromosomes 2, 10, and 11 during water stress, and one (qPR10) was located on chromosome 10 in well-watered conditions. These QTLs explained 34.37% and 18.41% of the phenotypic variation in water stress and well-watered conditions, respectively. In total, CC was largely controlled by main QTLs, and PR was mainly controlled by epistatic QTL pairs.
19723322	Involvement of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) in methyl halide emissions from agricultural plants: isolation and characterization of an HTMT-coding gene from Raphanus sativus (daikon radish).	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Biogenic emissions of methyl halides (CH3Cl, CH3Br and CH3I) are the major source of these compounds in the atmosphere; however, there are few reports about the halide profiles and strengths of these emissions. Halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) enzymes concerning these emissions have been purified and characterized from several organisms including marine algae, fungi, and higher plants; however, the correlation between emission profiles of methyl halides and the enzymatic properties of HMT/HTMT, and their role in vivo remains unclear.

RESULTS: Thirty-five higher plant species were screened, and high CH3I emissions and HMT/HTMT activities were found in higher plants belonging to the Poaceae family, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.), as well as the Brassicaceae family, including daikon radish (Raphanus sativus). The in vivo emission of CH3I clearly correlated with HMT/HTMT activity. The emission of CH3I from the sprouting leaves of R. sativus, T. aestivum and O. sativa grown hydroponically increased with increasing concentrations of supplied iodide. A gene encoding an S-adenosylmethionine halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) was cloned from R. sativus and expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. The recombinant R. sativus HTMT (RsHTMT) was revealed to possess high specificity for iodide (I-), bisulfide ([SH]-), and thiocyanate ([SCN]-) ions.

CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that HMT/HTMT activity is present in several families of higher plants including Poaceae and Brassicaceae, and is involved in the formation of methyl halides. Moreover, it was found that the emission of methyl iodide from plants was affected by the iodide concentration in the cultures. The recombinant RsHTMT demonstrated enzymatic properties similar to those of Brassica oleracea HTMT, especially in terms of its high specificity for iodide, bisulfide, and thiocyanate ions. A survey of biogenic emissions of methyl halides strongly suggests that the HTM/HTMT reaction is the key to understanding the biogenesis of methyl halides and methylated sulfur compounds in nature.
19727653	Amplification of prolamin storage protein genes in different subfamilies of the Poaceae.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Prolamins are seed storage proteins in cereals and represent an important source of essential amino acids for feed and food. Genes encoding these proteins resulted from dispersed and tandem amplification. While previous studies have concentrated on protein sequences from different grass species, we now can add a new perspective to their relationships by asking how their genes are shared by ancestry and copied in different lineages of the same family of species. These differences are derived from alignment of chromosomal regions, where collinearity is used to identify prolamin genes in syntenic positions, also called orthologous gene copies. New or paralogous gene copies are inserted in tandem or new locations of the same genome. More importantly, one can detect the loss of older genes. We analyzed chromosomal intervals containing prolamin genes from rice, sorghum, wheat, barley, and Brachypodium, representing different subfamilies of the Poaceae. The Poaceae commonly known as the grasses includes three major subfamilies, the Ehrhartoideae (rice), Pooideae (wheat, barley, and Brachypodium), and Panicoideae (millets, maize, sorghum, and switchgrass). Based on chromosomal position and sequence divergence, it becomes possible to infer the order of gene amplification events. Furthermore, the loss of older genes in different subfamilies seems to permit a faster pace of divergence of paralogous genes. Change in protein structure affects their physical properties, subcellular location, and amino acid composition. On the other hand, regulatory sequence elements and corresponding transcriptional activators of new gene copies are more conserved than coding sequences, consistent with the tissue-specific expression of these genes.
19729221	Riboflavin induces resistance in rice against Rhizoctonia solani via jasmonate-mediated priming of phenylpropanoid pathway.	2010	J Plant Physiol	Vitamins are plant growth regulators and activators of defense responses against pathogens. The cytomolecular mechanisms involved in the induction of resistance by chemicals especially vitamins on monocotyledonous plants are largely unknown. Here, we show that riboflavin, which acts as a defense activator in rice against economically important sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani, primed the expression of lipoxygenase (LOX) as a key gene in octadecanoid pathway, and enhanced lignification. Exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) application on rice induces resistance against R. solani in a manner similar to riboflavin. Application of jasmonate-deficient rice mutant hebiba and using a LOX inhibitor revealed the main role of octadecanoid pathway in riboflavin-induced resistance (IR). In riboflavin-treated inoculated plants, upregulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) expression, as a major marker of phenylpropanoid pathway, was detected downstream of LOX upregulation. Co-application of riboflavin and 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) on rice leaves revealed no upregulation of PAL and no priming in lignification. Furthermore, lower levels of PAL transcripts and lignin were detected in hebiba compared with control. These findings indicate the role of octadecanoid pathway in the induction of phenylpropanoid metabolism leading to lignification as a novel mechanism of riboflavin-IR in Oryza sativa-R. solani pathosystem.
20131478	Cloning and validation of novel miRNA from basmati rice indicates cross talk between abiotic and biotic stresses.	2009	Mol Genet Genomics	Most of the physiological processes are controlled by the small RNAs in several organisms including plants. A huge database exists on one type of small RNA, i.e., microRNAs (miRs) identified from diverse species. However, the processes of data-mining of miRs in most of the species are still incomplete. Rice feeds the hungry trillions and hence understanding its developmental processes as well as its stress biology, which might be largely controlled by the small RNA pathways, is certainly a worthwhile task. Here, we report the cloning and identification of approximately 40 new putative miRs from local basmati rice variety in accordance to the annotation suggested by Meyers et al. (Plant Cell 20:3186-3190, 2008). About 23 sequences were derived from rice exposed to salt stress while 18 were derived from rice infected with tungro virus. A few of these putative miRs were common to both. Our data showed that at least two of these miRs were up-regulated in response to both abiotic and biotic stresses. The miR target predictions indicate that most of the putative miRs target specific metabolic processes. The up-regulation of similar miRs in response to two entirely different types of stresses suggests a converging functional role of miRs in managing various stresses. Our findings suggest that more rice miRs need to be identified and a thorough understanding of the function of such miRs will help unravel the mysteries of rice stress biology.
19734433	A transporter at the node responsible for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	The concentration of essential mineral nutrients in the edible portion of plants such as grains may affect the nutritional value of these foods, while concentrations of toxic minerals in the plant are matter of food safety. Minerals taken up by the roots from soils are normally redirected at plant nodes before they are finally transported into developing seeds. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have not been identified so far. Herein, we report on a transporter (Lsi6) responsible for the redirection of a plant nutrient at the node. Lsi6 is a silicon transporter in rice (Oryza sativa), and its expression in node I below the panicles is greatly enhanced when the panicle is completely emerged. Lsi6 is mainly localized at the xylem transfer cells located at the outer boundary region of the enlarged large vascular bundles in node I. Knockout of Lsi6 decreased Si accumulation in the panicles but increased Si accumulation in the flag leaf. These results suggest that Lsi6 is a transporter involved in intervascular transfer (i.e., transfer of silicon from the large vascular bundles coming from the roots to the diffuse vascular bundles connected to the panicles). These findings will be useful for selectively enhancing the accumulation of essential nutrients and reducing toxic minerals in the edible portion of cereals.
19737364	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes.	2009	Plant J	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
19745569	A dominant mutation of TWISTED DWARF 1 encoding an alpha-tubulin protein causes severe dwarfism and right helical growth in rice.	2009	Genes Genet Syst	Dwarfism is a common type of mutation in many plant species. The pathways and factors regulating biosynthesis and signaling of several plant growth regulators have been clarified through analyses of dwarf mutants in rice, Arabidopsis, pea, and maize. However, the genetic mechanisms controlling dwarfism are not well characterized, and the causal genes underlying most dwarf mutants are still uncovered. Here, we report a dominant mutant, Twisted dwarf 1-1 (Tid1-1), showing dwarfism and twisted growth in rice. Tid1-1 exhibit right helical growth of the leaves and stem and shortening of the roots. They also show an increased number of cells in the shoot apical meristem. Cells in the leaves of Tid1-1 are often ill-shapen, possibly owing to irregular cell division. Cell elongation in roots is suppressed in the elongation zone, and cells in the root apical meristem are enlarged. Map-based cloning of TID1 revealed that it encodes an alpha-tubulin protein comprising microtubules and is an ortholog of Arabidopsis LEFTY genes. Our analysis of the Tid1-1 mutant revealed that the dynamics of microtubules affects not only anisotropic growth in both dicots and monocots, but also meristematic activity and gross plant morphology.
19749151	Evolution of AGL6-like MADS box genes in grasses (Poaceae): ovule expression is ancient and palea expression is new.	2009	Plant Cell	AGAMOUS-like6 (AGL6) genes encode MIKC-type MADS box transcription factors and are closely related to SEPALLATA and AP1/FUL-like genes. Here, we focus on the molecular evolution and expression of the AGL6-like genes in grasses. We have found that AGL6-like genes are expressed in ovules, lodicules (second whorl floral organs), paleas (putative first whorl floral organs), and floral meristems. Each of these expression domains was acquired at a different time in evolution, indicating that each represents a distinct function of the gene product and that the AGL6-like genes are pleiotropic. Expression in the inner integument of the ovule appears to be an ancient expression pattern corresponding to the expression of the gene in the megasporangium and integument in gymnosperms. Expression in floral meristems appears to have been acquired in the angiosperms and expression in second whorl organs in monocots. Early in grass evolution, AGL6-like orthologs acquired a new expression domain in the palea. Stamen expression is variable. Most grasses have a single AGL6-like gene (orthologous to the rice [Oryza sativa] gene MADS6). However, rice and other species of Oryza have a second copy (orthologous to rice MADS17) that appears to be the result of an ancient duplication.
19751706	Increased tolerance of rice to cold, drought and oxidative stresses mediated by the overexpression of a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein ZFP245.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	ZFP245 is a cold- and drought-responsive gene that encodes a zinc finger protein in rice. The ZFP245 protein localizes in the nucleus and exhibits trans-activation activity. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ZFP245 were generated and found to display high tolerance to cold and drought stresses. The transgenic plants did not exhibit growth retardation, but showed growth sensitivity against exogenous abscisic acid, increased free proline levels and elevated expression of rice pyrroline-5-carboxylatesynthetase and proline transporter genes under stress conditions. Overproduction of ZFP245 enhanced the activities of reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes under stress conditions and increased the tolerance of rice seedlings to oxidative stress. Our data suggest that ZFP245 may contribute to the tolerance of rice plants to cold and drought stresses by regulating proline levels and reactive oxygen species-scavenging activities, and therefore may be useful for developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress.
19756471	Map-based cloning of the ERECT PANICLE 3 gene in rice.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Panicle architecture in rice can have a strong influence on yield. Using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we isolated an erect panicle mutant, Hep, from Hwasunchalbyeo, a glutinous japonica rice cultivar. Genetic analysis revealed that the erect panicle phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutation designated erect panicle 3 (ep3). Genetic mapping revealed that the ep3 mutation was located on the short arm of chromosome 2 in a 0.1 cM region delimited by the STS markers STS5803-5 and STS5803-7. The ep3 locus corresponded to 46.8 kb region and contained six candidate genes. Comparison of the DNA sequences of the candidate genes from wild-type and erect panicle plants revealed a single base-pair change in the second exon of LOC_Os02g15950, which is predicted to result in a nonsense mutation. LOC_Os02g15950 encodes a putative F-box protein containing 515 amino acids and is expressed throughout the plant during all growth stages. A line carrying a T-DNA insertion in LOC_ Os02g15950 was obtained and shown to have the same phenotype as the ep3 mutant, thus confirming the identification of LOC_Os02g15950 as the ERECT PANICLE 3 (EP3) gene. The ep3 mutation causes a significant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype.
19763843	Expression of vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (OVP3) is under control of an anoxia-inducible promoter in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) expression increases in a number of abiotic stresses and is thought to play a role in adaptation to abiotic stresses. This paper reports on the regulation of six V-PPase genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) coleoptiles under anoxia, using flood tolerant and intolerant cultivars to test our hypothesis. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that one vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (OVP3) was induced by anoxia, particularly in flood-tolerant rice. Regulation of OVP3 expression under anoxia was investigated by analysing putative OVP promoters. The putative OVP3 promoter contained more previously identified anoxia-inducible motifs than the putative promoters of the other five OVP genes. GUS activity in transgenic rice plants containing the OVP3 promoter region linked to the GUS reporter gene was induced only by anoxia. Salt and cold treatments had little effect on OVP3 promoter-driven GUS expression when compared to the anoxic treatment.
19765235	Rice cellulose synthase-like D4 is essential for normal cell-wall biosynthesis and plant growth.	2009	Plant J	Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) proteins of glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT2) are believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of cell-wall polymers. The CSL D sub-family (CSLD) is common to all plants, but the functions of CSLDs remain to be elucidated. We report here an in-depth characterization of a narrow leaf and dwarf1 (nd1) rice mutant that shows significant reduction in plant growth due to retarded cell division. Map-based cloning revealed that ND1 encodes OsCSLD4, one of five members of the CSLD sub-family in rice. OsCSLD4 is mainly expressed in tissues undergoing rapid growth. Expression of OsCSLD4 fluorescently tagged at the C- or N-terminus in rice protoplast cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed that the protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi vesicles. Golgi localization was verified using phenotype-rescued transgenic plants expressing OsCSLD4-GUS under the control of its own promoter. Two phenotype-altered tissues, culms and root tips, were used to investigate the specific wall defects. Immunological studies and monosaccharide compositional and glycosyl linkage analyses explored several wall compositional effects caused by disruption of OsCSLD4, including alterations in the structure of arabinoxylan and the content of cellulose and homogalacturonan, which are distinct in the monocot grass species Oryza sativa (rice). The inconsistent alterations in the two tissues and the observable structural defects in primary walls indicate that OsCSLD4 plays important roles in cell-wall formation and plant growth.
19768557	Genome-wide analysis of genes encoding FK506-binding proteins in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	The FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are a class of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase enzymes, some of which can also operate as molecular chaperones. FKBPs comprise a large ubiquitous family, found in virtually every part of the cell and involved in diverse processes from protein folding to stress response. Higher plant genomes typically encode about 20 FKBPs, half of these found in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. Several FKBPs in plants are regulators of hormone signalling pathways, with important roles in seed germination, plant growth and stress response. Some FKBP isoforms exists as homologous duplicates operating in finely tuned mechanisms to cope with abiotic stress. In order to understand the roles of the plant FKBPs, especially in view of the warming environment, we have identified and analysed the gene families encoding these proteins in rice using computational approaches. The work has led to identification of all FKBPs from the rice genome, including novel high molecular weight forms. The rice FKBP family appears to have evolved by duplications of FKBP genes, which may be a strategy for increased stress tolerance.
19772648	Characterization of WRKY co-regulatory networks in rice and Arabidopsis.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The WRKY transcription factor gene family has a very ancient origin and has undergone extensive duplications in the plant kingdom. Several studies have pointed out their involvement in a range of biological processes, revealing that a large number of WRKY genes are transcriptionally regulated under conditions of biotic and/or abiotic stress. To investigate the existence of WRKY co-regulatory networks in plants, a whole gene family WRKYs expression study was carried out in rice (Oryza sativa). This analysis was extended to Arabidopsis thaliana taking advantage of an extensive repository of gene expression data.

RESULTS: The presented results suggested that 24 members of the rice WRKY gene family (22% of the total) were differentially-regulated in response to at least one of the stress conditions tested. We defined the existence of nine OsWRKY gene clusters comprising both phylogenetically related and unrelated genes that were significantly co-expressed, suggesting that specific sets of WRKY genes might act in co-regulatory networks. This hypothesis was tested by Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis of the Arabidopsis WRKY gene family in a large set of Affymetrix microarray experiments. AtWRKYs were found to belong to two main co-regulatory networks (COR-A, COR-B) and two smaller ones (COR-C and COR-D), all including genes belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups. The COR-A network contained several AtWRKY genes known to be involved mostly in response to pathogens, whose physical and/or genetic interaction was experimentally proven. We also showed that specific co-regulatory networks were conserved between the two model species by identifying Arabidopsis orthologs of the co-expressed OsWRKY genes.

CONCLUSION: In this work we identified sets of co-expressed WRKY genes in both rice and Arabidopsis that are functionally likely to cooperate in the same signal transduction pathways. We propose that, making use of data from co-regulatory networks, it is possible to highlight novel clusters of plant genes contributing to the same biological processes or signal transduction pathways. Our approach will contribute to unveil gene cooperation pathways not yet identified by classical genetic analyses. This information will open new routes contributing to the dissection of WRKY signal transduction pathways in plants.
19776160	Altered architecture and enhanced drought tolerance in rice via the down-regulation of indole-3-acetic acid by TLD1/OsGH3.13 activation.	2009	Plant Physiol	Plant architecture is determined by genetic and developmental programs as well as by environmental factors. Sessile plants have evolved a subtle adaptive mechanism that allows them to alter their growth and development during periods of stress. Phytohormones play a central role in this process; however, the molecules responsible for integrating growth- and stress-related signals are unknown. Here, we report a gain-of-function rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, tld1-D, characterized by (and named for) an increased number of tillers, enlarged leaf angles, and dwarfism. TLD1 is a rice GH3.13 gene that encodes indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, which is suppressed in aboveground tissues under normal conditions but which is dramatically induced by drought stress. The activation of TLD1 reduced the IAA maxima at the lamina joint, shoot base, and nodes, resulting in subsequent alterations in plant architecture and tissue patterning but enhancing drought tolerance. Accordingly, the decreased level of free IAA in tld1-D due to the conjugation of IAA with amino acids greatly facilitated the accumulation of late-embryogenesis abundant mRNA compared with the wild type. The direct regulation of such drought-inducible genes by changes in the concentration of IAA provides a model for changes in plant architecture via the process of drought adaptation, which occurs frequently in nature.
19778402	The distribution of japonica rice cultivars in the lower region of the Yangtze River valley is determined by its photoperiod-sensitivity and heading date genotypes.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	There are generally four recognized classes of japonica rice cultivars grown in the lower region of the Yangtze River valley. The geographical distribution of the four classes is latitude-dependent. Variation for heading date (HD) among 29 japonica rice cultivars grown in the lower region of the Yangtze River valley and belonging to the four classes was characterized, and their sensitivity to variations in photoperiod and temperature was analyzed. All of the cultivars were sensitive to both photoperiod and temperature. A regression analysis showed that HD is closely correlated with photoperiod sensitivity (PS). The PS of the four classes increased gradually from the medium maturing middle (MMM) types, through the late maturing middle (LMM) and early maturing late (EML) types to the medium maturing late (MML) types. Crosses with tester lines established that almost all of the cultivars carry the dominant early-heading allele at Ef-1, the photoperiod insensitive allele e(2) and the PS alleles E(1) or E(1) (t). Most of the MMM, LMM and MML types carry the insensitive allele e(3), while EML types have either E(3) or E(3) (t). At Se-1, MMM and LMM types have Se-1(e), some EML types have Se-1(e) and others Se-1(n), while the MML types are mostly Se-1(n). The PS of some MMM, LMM and EML types is reduced by the presence of hd2. These results show that the distribution of the four rice cultivar classes from high latitude to low latitude regions depended on a gradual increase in PS, which is mainly determined by its HD genotypes.
19778404	Different responses of plant growth and antioxidant system to the combination of cadmium and heat stress in transgenic and non-transgenic rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	A comparative study of just cadmium (Cd) or heat and their combination treatments on some physiological parameters and the antioxidant systems in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhonghua No.11) carrying glutathione-S-transferase (GST, EC. 2.5.1.18) and catalase1 (CAT1, EC. 1.11.1.6) and non-transgenics was conducted. The results revealed improved resistance in the transgenics to Cd and the combined Cd and heat stress than non-transgenics. Data showed that the activities of CAT, GST, superoxide dismutase (EC.1.15.1.1) and all components of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle measured in the stressed transgenics shoots are significantly different from those of non-transgenics. Results indicated that co-expression of GST and CAT1 had an important effect on the antioxidant system, in particular, the whole ascorbate-glutathione cycle. The less oxidative damage induced by Cd and the stress combination in the transgenics resulted not only from the GST and CAT1 transgene but also from the coordination of the whole ascorbate-glutathione cycle.
19798512	Involvement of two rice ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE genes in wound signaling.	2009	Mol Genet Genomics	Ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) have been proposed as key compounds for wound signaling in plants. In Arabidopsis, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is an essential transcription factor for ethylene signaling, is regulated at the post-transcriptional level, while transcriptional regulation of EIN3 or EIN3-LIKE (EIL) genes has not been well documented. The expression of 6 rice EIL genes (OsEIL1-6) was analyzed and only OsEIL1 and 2 were found to be wound-inducible EIL. OsEIL2 was also induced by JA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that recombinant OsEIL1 and 2 proteins bound to specific DNA sequences that are recognized by a wound-inducible tobacco EIL. Accumulation of OsEIL1 and 2 transcripts reached a maximum at 1 and 0.5 h after wounding, respectively, and the corresponding DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts of rice leaves was increased at 1 h after wounding. Candidates for OsEIL-target genes were selected by microarray analysis of wounded rice and by promoter sequence analyses of wound-inducible genes identified by microarray analysis. In OsEIL1- and/or 2-suppressed rice plants, the expression of at least four of 18 candidate genes analyzed was down-regulated. These results indicate the importance of inducible OsEILs in wound signaling in rice.
19807881	Inactivation of the CTD phosphatase-like gene OsCPL1 enhances the development of the abscission layer and seed shattering in rice.	2010	Plant J	Although susceptibility to seed shattering causes severe yield loss during cereal crop harvest, it is an adaptive trait for seed dispersal in wild plants. We previously identified a recessive shattering locus, sh-h, from the rice shattering mutant line Hsh that carries an enhanced abscission layer. Here, we further mapped sh-h to a 34-kb region on chromosome 7 by analyzing 240 F(2) plants and five F(3) lines from the cross between Hsh and Blue&Gundil. Hsh had a point mutation at the 3' splice site of the seventh intron within LOC_Os07g10690, causing a 15-bp deletion of its mRNA as a result of altered splicing. Two transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants and one point mutant exhibited the enhanced shattering phenotype, confirming that LOC_Os07g10690 is indeed the sh-h gene. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines with suppressed expression of this gene exhibited greater shattering. This gene, which encodes a protein containing a conserved carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase domain, was named Oryza sativa CTD phosphatase-like 1 (OsCPL1). Subcellular localization and biochemical analysis revealed that the OsCPL1 protein is a nuclear phosphatase, a common characteristic of metazoan CTD phosphatases involved in cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that OsCPL1 represses differentiation of the abscission layer during panicle development.
19808806	Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor OsGLK1 induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	For systematic and genome-wide analyses of rice gene functions, we took advantage of the full-length cDNA overexpresser (FOX) gene-hunting system and generated >12 000 independent FOX-rice lines from >25 000 rice calli treated with the rice-FOX Agrobacterium library. We found two FOX-rice lines generating green calli on a callus-inducing medium containing 2,4-D, on which wild-type rice calli became ivory yellow. In both lines, OsGLK1 cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed. Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the OsGLK1-FOX calli. Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in OsGLK1-FOX calli cells. However, in darkness, OsGLK1-FOX calli did not show a green color or develop grana stacks. Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from OsGLK1-FOX seedlings. The OsGLK1-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in OsGLK1-FOX rice calli are functional and active. We also observed that the endogenous OsGLK1 mRNA level increased synchronously with the greening of wild-type calli after transfer to plantlet regeneration medium. These results strongly suggest that OsGLK1 regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development.
19808807	High temperatures cause male sterility in rice plants with transcriptional alterations during pollen development.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant male reproductive development is highly organized and sensitive to various environmental stressors, including high temperature. We have established an experimental procedure to evaluate high temperature injury in japonica rice plants. High temperature treatment (39 degrees C/30 degrees C) starting at the microspore stage repeatedly reduced spikelet fertility in our system. Morphological observations revealed that pollen viability in plants exposed to high temperatures was lower than that in control plants. Most pollen grains in high temperature-treated plants displayed a normal round shape and stained reddish purple with Alexander's reagent; however, the pollen grains were very poorly attached and displayed limited germination on the stigma. To investigate gene regulatory mechanisms in the anther in high temperature environments, DNA microarray analysis was performed by comparing non-treated samples with samples treated with 2-4 d of high heat. Genes responsive to high temperatures were identified from clustering of microarray data. Among these, at least 13 were designated as high temperature-repressed genes in the anther. Expression analyses revealed that these genes were expressed specifically in the immature anther mainly in the tapetum at the microspore stage and down-regulated after 1 d of high temperature. The expression levels of Osc6, OsRAFTIN and TDR, which are tapetum-specific genes, were unaffected by high temperatures. These results suggest that not all tapetal genes are inhibited by increased temperatures and the tapetum itself is not degraded in such an environment. However, high temperatures may disrupt some of the tapetum functions required for pollen adhesion and germination on the stigma.
19812064	Rice BRITTLE CULM 5 (BRITTLE NODE) is involved in secondary cell wall formation in the sclerenchyma tissue of nodes.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Several brittle culm (bc) mutants known in grasses are considered excellent materials to study the process of secondary cell wall formation. The brittle phenotype of the rice bc5 (brittle node) mutant appears exclusively in the developed nodes, which is distinct from other bc mutants (bc1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) that show the brittle phenotype in culms and leaves. To address the defects of the rice bc5 mutant in node-specific cell wall formation, we analyzed tissue morphology and cell wall composition. The bc5 mutation was found to affect the cell wall deposition of node sclerenchyma tissues at 1 week after heading, the stage at which the cell wall sugar content is reduced, in the bc5 nodes, compared with wild-type nodes. Moreover, decreased accumulation of lignin and thickness of cell walls in the sclerenchyma tissues were also observed in the bc5 nodes. The amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose were reduced to 53 and 65% of those in the wild-type plants, respectively. Sugar composition and glycosidic linkage analyses of the hemicellulose showed that the accumulation of glucuronosyl arabinoxylan in bc5 nodes was perturbed by the mutation. The bc5 locus was narrowed to an approximately 3.1 Mb region of chromosome 2, where none of the other bc genes is located. The bc5 mutation appeared to reduce the expression levels of the OsCesA genes in the nodes after heading. The results indicate that the BC5 gene regulates the development of secondary cell walls of node sclerenchyma tissues.
19812186	Replication protein A (RPA1a) is required for meiotic and somatic DNA repair but is dispensable for DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Replication protein A (RPA), a highly conserved single-stranded DNA-binding protein in eukaryotes, is a stable complex comprising three subunits termed RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3. RPA is required for multiple processes in DNA metabolism such as replication, repair, and homologous recombination in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human. Most eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, insects, and vertebrates, have only a single RPA gene that encodes each RPA subunit. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), however, possess multiple copies of an RPA gene. Rice has three paralogs each of RPA1 and RPA2, and one for RPA3. Previous studies have established their biochemical interactions in vitro and in vivo, but little is known about their exact function in rice. We examined the function of OsRPA1a in rice using a T-DNA insertional mutant. The osrpa1a mutants had a normal phenotype during vegetative growth but were sterile at the reproductive stage. Cytological examination confirmed that no embryo sac formed in female meiocytes and that abnormal chromosomal fragmentation occurred in male meiocytes after anaphase I. Compared with wild type, the osrpa1a mutant showed no visible defects in mitosis and chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. In addition, the osrpa1a mutant was hypersensitive to ultraviolet-C irradiation and the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and methyl methanesulfonate. Thus, our data suggest that OsRPA1a plays an essential role in DNA repair but may not participate in, or at least is dispensable for, DNA replication and homologous recombination in rice.
19816106	A novel plant cysteine-rich peptide family conferring cadmium tolerance to yeast and plants.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	We have identified a novel cDNA clone, termed DcCDT1, from Digitaria ciliaris, that confers cadmium (Cd)-tolerance to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The gene encodes a predicted peptide of 55 amino acid residues of which 15 (27.3%) are cysteine residues. We found that monocotyledonous plants possess multiple DcCDT1 homologues, for example rice contains five DcCDT1 homologues (designated OsCDT1~5), whereas dicotyledonous plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba) and Picea sitchensis, appear to possess only a single homologue. GFP fusion experiments demonstrate that DcCDT1 and OsCDT1 are targeted to both the plant cytoplasmic membranes and cell walls. Constitutive expression of DcCDT1 or OsCDT1 confers Cd-tolerance to transgenic A. thaliana plants by lowering the accumulation of Cd in the cells. The functions of the DcCDT1 family members are discussed in the light of these findings.
19816108	Rice OsSIPK: a central component of ozone-triggered physiological responses.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The OsSIPK expression is transcriptionally regulated in time and space by diverse environmental stresses and phytohormones. Rice OsSIPK and its orthologs in other plants are highly conserved and appear to have overlapping physiological responses. Given our interest in understanding the signaling and metabolic pathways responsible for environmental factors, we briefly discuss the role of OsSIPK in ozone-triggered physiological responses, particularly in rice. We also provide evidence on tight correlation between ozone-induced OsSIPK expression and ethylene production.
19816111	Roles of DLT in fine modulation on brassinosteroid response in rice.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Accumulated evidences suggest that brassinosteroid (BR) response is fine-tuned by multiple strategies. Recently, a GRAS protein, DLT, was identified to be involved in rice BR signaling. Transcription analysis of most known BR-related genes, including biosynthetic genes, signaling genes and also several downstream BR responsive genes, reveals DLT has extensive effects on BR-related genes expression, indicating its important role in modulating BR response. By promoter and protein sequence analysis, a complicated and subtle network was proposed that DLT may be involved in fine-modulating BR response at both transcriptional and protein levels. This provides new insights into BR signaling pathway and also gives a clear direction for the future work.
19816140	Evolution of CLE signaling: origins of the CLV1 and SOL2/CRN receptor diversity.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The shoot apical meristem is maintained by the intercellular factor, CLV3, a dodecapeptide in Arabidopsis. CLV3 belongs to the CLE family and putative CLE genes have been found in various plants, even in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Here, we report that a pteridophyte, Selaginella moelendorffii, also has 15 putative CLE genes in its genome. On the other hand, CLV1 is reported to function as a receptor for the CLV3 peptide, and other CLE peptides might be recognized by CLV1 homologues in various plants. Recent genetic studies of the crn and sol2 mutants of Arabidopsis have revealed that SOL2/CRN encodes a receptor-like kinase protein. SOL2/CRN functions together with CLV2 independently of CLV1 in the CLE signaling pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of CLV1, CLV2 and SOL2/CRN revealed that Arabidopsis, rice, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera have one copy of the SOL2/CRN and CLV2 homologues, and Selaginella moelendorffii and Physcomitrella patens have no homologues. In contrast, a number of CLV1 homologues were identified in the genomic databases of Arabidopsis, rice, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, and even a pteridophyte, Selaginella moelendorffii, and a moss, Physcomitrella patens. These results indicate that CLV1 and its homologues play multiple roles in plant development and environmental responses, whereas SOL2/CRN and CLV2 have more specific roles in vascular plants.
19820190	MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1, an AGL6-like MADS box gene, regulates floral organ identity and meristem fate in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Floral organ identity and meristem determinacy in plants are controlled by combinations of activities mediated by MADS box genes. AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6)-like genes are MADS box genes expressed in floral tissues, but their biological functions are mostly unknown. Here, we describe an AGL6-like gene in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (MFO1/MADS6), that regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy. In the flower of mfo1 mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic organs were observed. Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in mfo1 florets. The expression patterns of floral MADS box genes were disturbed in the mutant florets. Suppression of another rice AGL6-like gene, MADS17, caused no morphological abnormalities in the wild-type background, but it enhanced the phenotype in the mfo1 background, indicating that MADS17 has a minor but redundant function with that of MFO1. Whereas single mutants in either MFO1 or the SEPALLATA-like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the mfo1 lhs1 double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet meristem determinacy. We propose that rice AGL6-like genes help to control floral organ identity and the establishment and determinacy of the floral meristem redundantly with LHS1.
19820307	Epigenetic interaction of OsHDAC1 with the OsNAC6 gene promoter regulates rice root growth.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription. Previously, we have shown that transgenic overexpression of OsHDAC1 gene alters the seedling root growth. In the current report, we have identified a group of genes that are transcriptionally repressed in the OsHDAC1 overexpressors (OsHDAC1(OE)) by performing a global profiling of root expressed genes. The OsNAC6 gene, a member of NAC family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon and found to be repressed in OsHDAC1(OE). The root growth of OsNAC6 knock-out (OsNAC6(KO)) seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Conversely, the root growth of the OsNAC6 overexpressors (OsNAC6(OE)) was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out (OsHDAC1(KO)) seedlings. We further demonstrated that OsHDAC1 interact with the OsNAC6 gene promoter at a epigenetic level by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4. Overall, our results suggest that OsHDAC1 represses the OsNAC6 gene expression, which is primarily responsible for the alteration of root growth of rice seedlings.
19820313	Phototropins and chloroplast activity in plant blue light signaling.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	In plants, phototropins 1 (phot1) and 2 (phot2) mediate chloroplast movement to blue light (BL). A recent report showed that phototropins (phot) are required for the expression of chloroplast genes in rice. The light-induced responses of phot1a rice mutants result in H(2)O(2)-mediated damage to chloroplast photosystems, indicating that phot-regulated responses might be associated with the other photoreceptor, such as cryptochrome (cry) BL receptor. This suggests diversification and specialization of photoreceptor signaling in plants.
19820319	Rice transcription factor AP37 involved in grain yield increase under drought stress.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Drought is a serious threat to the sustainability of rice yields in rainfed agriculture. In particular, exposure to drought conditions during the stage of panicle development of a rice plant results in a delayed flowering time, reduced number of spikelets and poor grain filling. In our recent report, we functionally characterized the rice AP37 gene for drought tolerance during the vegetative and reproductive growth. Transgenic overexpression of the AP37 with the OsCc1 promoter in rice increased the tolerance to drought, high salinity and low temperature at the vegetative stage. The transgenic plants OsCc1:AP37 also showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance at the reproductive stage, as evidenced by the increase in grain yield by 16-57% over controls under severe field drought conditions. Thus, our results suggest that the AP37 gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance without causing undesirable growth phenotypes.
19820348	Role of OsHSP90 and IREN, Ca2+ dependent nuclease, in plant hypersensitive cell death induced by transcription factor OsNAC4.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The hypersensitive response (HR) is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) commonly associated with the immune response in plants. HR cell death is often characterized by DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, protein degradation and typical morphological changes such as plasma membrane shrinkage and nuclear condensation. Initiation of HR cell death requires de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that HR cell death induction involves a transcriptional network regulated by a key factor. We recently identified the OsNAC4 gene, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor that exhibited rapid but transient transcriptional activation during the early stages of HR cell death. Overexpression of OsNAC4 in rice plants induced cell death accompanied by all characteristics of HR cell death: DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and protein degradation. In OsNAC4 RNAi knock-down lines exposed to an avirulent bacterial strain, the cellular response was characterized by a marked decrease in HR cell death compared to wild-type rice cells. Gene expression profiling, which compared rice cells and OsNAC4 knock-down transformants using a rice cDNA microarray, demonstrated that OsNAC4 controls the transcription of at least 139 genes including OsHSP90, involved in loss of plasma membrane integrity, and IREN, which encodes novel plant nuclease involved in cleavage of nuclear DNA. Here we report that although OsNAC4 overexpression caused rapid protein degradation during HR cell death, neither IREN nor OsHSP90 were involved. Thus, three important processes that accompany HR cell death are regulated by independent signaling pathways that are collectively induced by OsNAC4.
19822337	Analysis of CMP-sialic acid transporter-like proteins in plants.	2009	Phytochemistry	It is commonly accepted that sialic acids do not exist in plants. However, putative gene homologs of animal sialyltransferases and CMP-sialic acid transporters have been detected in the genomes of some plants. To elucidate the physiological functions of these genes, we cloned 2 cDNAs from Oryza sativa (Japanese rice), each of which encodes a CMP-sialic acid transporter-like protein designated as OsCSTLP1 and OsCSTLP2. To examine the CMP-sialic acid transporter activity of OsCSTLP1 and OsCSTLP2, we introduced their expression vectors into CMP-sialic acid transporter activity-deficient Lec2 cells. Transfection with OsCSTLP1 resulted in recovery of the deficit phenotype of Lec2 cells, but transfection with OsCSTLP2 did not. We also performed an in vitro nucleotide sugar transport assay using a yeast expression system. Among the nucleotide sugars examined, the OsCSTLP1-containing yeast microsomal membrane vesicles specifically incorporated CMP-sialic acid, indicating that OsCSTLP1 has CMP-sialic acid transporter activity. On the other hand, OsCSTLP2 did not exhibit any nucleotide sugar transporter activity. T-DNA insertion lines of Arabidopsis thaliana targeting the homologs of the OsCSTLP1 and OsCSTLP2 genes exhibited a lethal phenotype, suggesting that these proteins play important roles in plant development and may transport important nucleotide sugars such as CMP-Kdo in physiological conditions.
19822730	Evolutionary dynamics of the genomic region around the blast resistance gene Pi-ta in AA genome Oryza species.	2009	Genetics	The race-specific resistance gene Pi-ta has been effectively used to control blast disease, one of the most destructive plant diseases worldwide. A single amino acid change at the 918 position of the Pi-ta protein was known to determine resistance specificity. To understand the evolutionary dynamics present, we examined sequences of the Pi-ta locus and its flanking regions in 159 accessions composed of seven AA genome Oryza species: O. sativa, O. rufipogon, O. nivara, O. meridionalis, O. glaberrima, O. barthii, and O. glumaepatula. A 3364-bp fragment encoding a predicted transposon was found in the proximity of the Pi-ta promoter region associated with the resistance phenotype. Haplotype network analysis with 33 newly identified Pi-ta haplotypes and 18 newly identified Pi-ta protein variants demonstrated the evolutionary relationships of Pi-ta haplotypes between O. sativa and O. rufipogon. In O. rufipogon, the recent directional selection was found in the Pi-ta region, while significant deviation from neutral evolution was not found in all O. sativa groups. Results of sequence variation in flanking regions around Pi-ta in O. sativa suggest that the size of the resistant Pi-ta introgressed block was at least 5.4 Mb in all elite resistant cultivars but not in the cultivars without Pi-ta. These findings demonstrate that the Pi-ta region with transposon and additional plant modifiers has evolved under an extensive selection pressure during crop breeding.
19822732	Fine mapping and haplotype structure analysis of a major flowering time quantitative trait locus on maize chromosome 10.	2009	Genetics	Flowering time is a major adaptive trait in plants and an important selection criterion for crop species. In maize, however, little is known about its molecular basis. In this study, we report the fine mapping and characterization of a major quantitative trait locus located on maize chromosome 10, which regulates flowering time through photoperiod sensitivity. This study was performed in near-isogenic material derived from a cross between the day-neutral European flint inbred line FV286 and the tropical short-day inbred line FV331. Recombinant individuals were identified among a large segregating population and their progenies were scored for flowering time. Combined genotypic characterization led to delimit the QTL to an interval of 170 kb and highlighted an unbalanced recombination pattern. Two bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) covering the region were analyzed to identify putative candidate genes, and synteny with rice, sorghum, and brachypodium was investigated. A gene encoding a CCT domain protein homologous to the rice Ghd7 heading date regulator was identified, but its causative role was not demonstrated and deserves further analyses. Finally, an association study showed a strong level of linkage disequilibrium over the region and highlighted haplotypes that could provide useful information for the exploitation of genetic resources and marker-assisted selection in maize.
19823935	The qSD12 underlying gene promotes abscisic acid accumulation in early developing seeds to induce primary dormancy in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Seeds acquire primary dormancy during their development and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to play a role in inducing the dormancy. qSD12 is a major seed dormancy quantitative trait locus (QTL) identified from weedy rice. This research was conducted to identify qSD12 candidate genes, isolate the candidates from weedy rice, and determine the relation of the dormancy gene to ABA. A fine mapping experiment, followed by marker-assisted progeny testing for selected recombinants, narrowed down qSD12 to a genomic region of <75 kb, where there are nine predicted genes including a cluster of six transposon/retrotransposon protein genes and three putative (a PIL5, a hypothetic protein, and a bHLH transcription factor) genes based on the annotated Nipponbare genome sequence. The PIL5 and bHLH genes are more likely to be the QTL candidate genes. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library equivalent to 8-9 times of the haploid genome size was constructed for the weedy rice. One of the two BAC contigs developed from the library covers the PIL5 to bHLH interval. A pair of lines different only in the QTL-containing region of <200 kb was developed as isogenic lines for the qSD12 dormancy and non-dormancy alleles. The dormant line accumulated much higher ABA in 10-day developing seeds than the non-dormant line. In the QTL-containing region there is no predicted gene that has been assigned to ABA biosynthetic or metabolic pathways. Thus, it is concluded that the qSD12 underlying gene promotes ABA accumulation in early developing seeds to induce primary seed dormancy.
19825616	Comparative genomic study of the thioredoxin family in photosynthetic organisms with emphasis on Populus trichocarpa.	2009	Mol Plant	The recent genome sequencing of Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera, two models of woody plants, of Sorghum bicolor, a model of monocot using C4 metabolism, and of the moss Physcomitrella patens, together with the availability of photosynthetic organism genomes allows performance of a comparative genomic study with organisms having different ways of life, reproduction modes, biological traits, and physiologies. Thioredoxins (Trxs) are small ubiquitous proteins involved in the reduction of disulfide bridges in a variety of target enzymes present in all sub-cellular compartments and involved in many biochemical reactions. The genes coding for these enzymes have been identified in these newly sequenced genomes and annotated. The gene content, organization and distribution were compared to other photosynthetic organisms, leading to a refined classification. This analysis revealed that higher plants and bryophytes have a more complex family compared to algae and cyanobacteria and to non-photosynthetic organisms, since poplar exhibits 49 genes coding for typical and atypical thioredoxins and thioredoxin reductases, namely one-third more than monocots such as Oryza sativa and S. bicolor. The higher number of Trxs in poplar is partially explained by gene duplication in the Trx m, h, and nucleoredoxin classes. Particular attention was paid to poplar genes with emphasis on Trx-like classes called Clot, thioredoxin-like, thioredoxins of the lilium type and nucleoredoxins, which were not described in depth in previous genomic studies.
19825651	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes.	2009	Mol Plant	Polycomb group proteins (PcG) play important roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses. No homologs of the Arabidopsis seed-expressed PcG genes MEA and FIS2 were identified in the rice genome. We have isolated T-DNA insertion lines in the rice homologs of three PcG genes. There is no autonomous endosperm development in these T-DNA insertion lines. One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene.
19825657	Expression of PIN genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.): tissue specificity and regulation by hormones.	2009	Mol Plant	Twelve genes of the PIN family in rice were analyzed for gene and protein structures and an evolutionary relationship with reported AtPINs in Arabidopsis. Four members of PIN1 (designated as OsPIN1a-d), one gene paired with AtPIN2 (OsPIN2), three members of PIN5 (OsPIN5a-c), one gene paired with AtPIN8 (OsPIN8), and three monocot-specific PINs (OsPIN9, OsPIN10a, and b) were identified from the phylogenetic analysis. Tissue-specific expression patterns of nine PIN genes among them were investigated using RT-PCR and GUS reporter. The wide variations in the expression domain in different tissues of the PIN genes were observed. In general, PIN genes are up-regulated by exogenous auxin, while different responses of different PIN genes to other hormones were found.
19825675	Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA mutants implicate GAUT genes in the biosynthesis of pectin and xylan in cell walls and seed testa.	2009	Mol Plant	Galacturonosyltransferase 1 (GAUT1) is an alpha1,4-D-galacturonosyltransferase that transfers galacturonic acid from uridine 5'-diphosphogalacturonic acid onto the pectic polysaccharide homogalacturonan (Sterling et al., 2006). The 25-member Arabidopsis thaliana GAUT1-related gene family encodes 15 GAUT and 10 GAUT-like (GATL) proteins with, respectively, 56-84 and 42-53% amino acid sequence similarity to GAUT1. Previous phylogenetic analyses of AtGAUTs indicated three clades: A through C. A comparative phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis, poplar and rice GAUT families has sub-classified the GAUTs into seven clades: clade A-1 (GAUTs 1 to 3); A-2 (GAUT4); A-3 (GAUTs 5 and 6); A-4 (GAUT7); B-1 (GAUTs 8 and 9); B-2 (GAUTs 10 and 11); and clade C (GAUTs 12 to 15). The Arabidopsis GAUTs have a distribution comparable to the poplar orthologs, with the exception of GAUT2, which is absent in poplar. Rice, however, has no orthologs of GAUTs 2 and 12 and has multiple apparent orthologs of GAUTs 1, 4, and 7 compared with either Arabidopsis or poplar. The cell wall glycosyl residue compositions of 26 homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants for 13 of 15 Arabidopsis GAUT genes reveal significantly and reproducibly different cell walls in specific tissues of gaut mutants 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 from that of wild-type Arabidopsis walls. Pectin and xylan polysaccharides are affected by the loss of GAUT function, as demonstrated by the altered galacturonic acid, xylose, rhamnose, galactose, and arabinose composition of distinct gaut mutant walls. The wall glycosyl residue compositional phenotypes observed among the gaut mutants suggest that at least six different biosynthetic linkages in pectins and/or xylans are affected by the lesions in these GAUT genes. Evidence is also presented to support a role for GAUT11 in seed mucilage expansion and in seed wall and mucilage composition.
19825680	Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene (MIR) plays an important role in iron homeostasis.	2009	Mol Plant	Mitochondria utilize iron (Fe), but the proteins involved in mitochondrial Fe regulation are not characterized in plants. We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated (MIR) gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis. MIR, when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells, was localized to the mitochondria. MIR transcripts were greatly increased in response to Fe deficiency in roots and shoot tissue. MIR is not homologous to any known protein, as homologs were not found in the rice or Arabidopsis genome databases, or in the EST database for other organisms. Growth in the MIR T-DNA knockout rice mutant (mir) was significantly impaired compared to wild-type (WT) plants when grown under Fe-deficient or -sufficient conditions. Furthermore, mir plants accumulated more than twice the amount of Fe in shoot and root tissue compared to WT plants when grown under either Fe-sufficient or -deficient conditions. Despite the high accumulation of Fe in roots and shoots, mir plants triggered the expression of Fe-deficiency-inducible genes, indicating that mir may not be able to utilize Fe for physiological functions. These results clearly suggest that MIR is a rice-specific mitochondrial protein, recently evolved, and plays a significant role in Fe homeostasis.
19825834	CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11alpha-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Biosynthetic gene clusters are common in microbial organisms, but rare in plants, raising questions regarding the evolutionary forces that drive their assembly in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we characterize the biochemical function of a rice (Oryza sativa) cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP76M7, which seems to act in the production of antifungal phytocassanes and defines a second diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice. This cluster is uniquely multifunctional, containing enzymatic genes involved in the production of two distinct sets of phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides/oryzadiones, with the corresponding genes being subject to distinct transcriptional regulation. The lack of uniform coregulation of the genes within this multifunctional cluster suggests that this was not a primary driving force in its assembly. However, the cluster is dedicated to specialized metabolism, as all genes in the cluster are involved in phytoalexin metabolism. We hypothesize that this dedication to specialized metabolism led to the assembly of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Consistent with this hypothesis, molecular phylogenetic comparison demonstrates that the two rice diterpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters have undergone independent elaboration to their present-day forms, indicating continued evolutionary pressure for coclustering of enzymatic genes encoding components of related biosynthetic pathways.
19938377	Evidence for a role of hexokinases as conserved glucose sensors in both monocot and dicot plant species.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The role of the hexokinases (HXKs) as glucose (Glc) sensors has been mainly demonstrated for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HXK1 (AtHXK1) but has yet to be shown in other plant species. In our recent publication, we reported that two rice (Oryza sativa) HXKs, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, also function as Glc sensors. These two enzymes harbor both mitochondrial targeting peptides (mTPs) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and we confirmed their dual-targeting ability to nuclei and mitochondria using GFP fusion experiments. Consistently, it has been previously known that AtHXK1 is predominantly associated with mitochondria but is also present in nuclei in vivo at appreciable levels. Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their catalytically inactive mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutant. In addition, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) gene in response to glucose treatment. Our results thus provided evidence that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as glucose sensors in rice. Hence, the available current data suggest that the role of the HXKs as Glc sensors may be conserved in both monocot and dicot plant species, and that the nuclear localization of AtHXK1, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 may be critical for Glc sensing and signaling.
19826229	Distinctive phytotoxic effects of Cd and Ni on membrane functionality.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Metal ions essential for plant growth, such as Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu or Zn, are taken up by plants from the soil solution through metal transporters at the plasma membrane, mainly of the ZIP and Nramp families. These transport systems, however, can also give entry to other metals (Al, Cd, Hg, Pb). Non-nutritive elements, as well as the essential nutrients at higher than metabolic concentrations, can cause phytotoxicity. We have studied previously the effects of an essential (Ni) and a non essential (Cd) heavy metal on root cell plasma membranes, the first selective barrier encountered when entering the plant, using rice as model plant. Distinctive effects of Cd and Ni on membrane function (i.e., Em and membrane permeability) were observed in the short term. We have now confirmed the pattern of Em changes caused by Cd and Ni using barley roots and have also followed the effects of both metals in longer term in rice. Our data indicate that the distinct effects caused by Cd and Ni are due to differences in cellular responses, triggered when entering the cytoplasm (i.e., an efficient detoxifying mechanism for Cd), more than to different direct effects on membranes.
19826775	Multiple gene loci affecting genetic background-controlled disease resistance conferred by R gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	The function of bacterial-blight resistance gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice is influenced by genetic background; the Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica background can increase Xa3/Xa26 expression, resulting in an enhanced resistance. To identify whether Xa3/Xa26 transcript level is the only factor contributing to genetic background-controlled resistance, we screened an F(2) population that was developed from a cross between Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica rice lines and was segregating for Xa3/Xa26, and compared the expression profiles of a pair of indica and japonica rice lines that both carried Xa3/Xa26. Eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), in addition to Xa3/Xa26, were identified as contributing to the bacterial resistance of this population. Four of the eight QTLs were contributed to the japonica line. The resistance of this population was also affected by epistatic effects. Some F(2) individuals showed significantly increased Xa3/Xa26 transcripts, but the increased transcripts did not completely correlate with the reduced disease in this population. The analysis of the expression profile of Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance using a microarray containing approximate 7,990 rice genes identified 44 differentially expressed genes. Thirty-five genes were rapidly activated in the japonica background, but not in the indica background, during disease resistance. These results suggest that multiple factors, including the one resulting in increased Xa3/Xa26 expression, may contribute to the enhanced resistance in the japonica background. These factors can cause a variation in gene expression profile that differs from that in the indica background during disease resistance.
20514239	Auxin-responsive SAUR39 gene modulates auxin level in rice.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The signaling molecule auxin plays a central role in several aspects of plant growth and developmental processes. Underlying optimization of these processes are complex mechanisms orchestrating the expression of genes involved in controlling auxin level, movement and signalling. The small auxin-up RNA (SAUR) family comprises a large set of genes whose expressions are early auxin-responsive. However, the function of these genes is largely unknown. Loss-of-function mutants in a number of Arabidopsis SAUR genes did not show any marked phenotypic differences to wild-type plants likely due to compensatory functions of conserved members of the SAUR gene family. We have recently shown that a rice SAUR39 gene negatively regulates auxin synthesis and transport in rice. Here we propose a model that constitutive induction of SAUR39 gene expression reduces growth and seed yield in rice plants due to the presence of a lower auxin level, reduced polar auxin transport, less chlorophyll and increased sugar and anthocyanin contents. In wild-type plants, the SAUR39 gene is expressed at a low level and is transiently induced by changes in external auxin or other environmental stimuli, but within hours of this change its expression is reduced to the low constitutive level. This homeostatic mechanism is essential for optimal plant growth and seed yield and its disruption due to the constitutive overexpression of SAUR39 leads to a set of negative pleiotropic phenotypes.
20514236	Differentially regulated kinases and phosphatases in roots may contribute to inter-cultivar difference in rice salinity tolerance.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Rice is the second most important cereal crop in the world but its production suffers from saline environments in many areas since it is one of the most salt sensitive crops. However, the large divergence in tolerance between rice cultivars can be exploited to gain insights into mechanisms of salinity tolerance, for example by carrying out comparative transcriptomics studies. We recently showed that specific transporters in roots of the tolerant rice cultivar FL478 are differentially regulated compared to their counterparts in the more sensitive IR29 cultivar and that this may contribute to the observed lower Na(+) influx, reduced Na(+) translocation to the shoot, and lower Na(+):K(+) ratio observed in FL478. In this addendum we further evaluated some of the regulatory genes that are potentially important in the modulation of membrane transporters involved in rice cation homeostasis.
19830390	OsPRP3, a flower specific proline-rich protein of rice, determines extracellular matrix structure of floral organs and its overexpression confers cold-tolerance.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Proline-rich protein (PRP), a cell wall protein of plant, has been studied in many plant species. Yet, none of the PRPs has been functionally elucidated. Here we report a novel flower-specific PRP designated OsPRP3 from rice. Expression analysis showed that the OsPRP3 transcript was mainly present in rice flower and accumulated abundantly during the late stage of the flower development. To study the function of OsPRP3, we constructed and transformed a binary vector containing a full clone of OsPRP3 in sense orientation and also an RNAi vector to achieve overexpression and knockout of the gene, respectively. Our overexpression plants showed a significant increase in cold tolerance than the WT plants which is conferred by the accumulation of OsPRP3 protein during cold treatment. Further the microscopic analysis revealed that OsPRP3 enhances the cell wall integrity in the cold tolerant plant and confers cold-tolerance in rice. Microscopic analysis of the RNAi mutant flower revealed that blocking OsPRP3 function caused significant defects in floral organogenesis. Taken together, the results suggested that OsPRP3 is a cell wall protein, playing a crucial role in determining extracellular matrix structure of floral organs.
19833360	Analysis of peroxidase activity of rice (Oryza sativa) recombinant hemoglobin 1: implications for in vivo function of hexacoordinate non-symbiotic hemoglobins in plants.	2010	Phytochemistry	In plants, it has been proposed that hexacoordinate (class 1) non-symbiotic Hbs (nsHb-1) function in vivo as peroxidases. However, little is known about peroxidase activity of nsHb-1. We evaluated the peroxidase activity of rice recombinant Hb1 (a nsHb-1) by using the guaiacol/H2O2 system at pH 6.0 and compared it to that from horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Results showed that the affinity of rice Hb1 for H2O2 was 86-times lower than that of HRP (K(m)=23.3 and 0.27 mM, respectively) and that the catalytic efficiency of rice Hb1 for the oxidation of guaiacol using H2O2 as electron donor was 2838-times lower than that of HRP (k(cat)/K(m)=15.8 and 44,833 mM(-1) min(-1), respectively). Also, results from this work showed that rice Hb1 is not chemically modified and binds CO after incubation with high H2O2 concentration, and that it poorly protects recombinant Escherichia coli from H2O2 stress. These observations indicate that rice Hb1 inefficiently scavenges H2O2 as compared to a typical plant peroxidase, thus indicating that non-symbiotic Hbs are unlikely to function as peroxidases in planta.
19837870	Functional analyses of LONELY GUY cytokinin-activating enzymes reveal the importance of the direct activation pathway in Arabidopsis.	2009	Plant Cell	Cytokinins play crucial roles in diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Spatiotemporal distribution of bioactive cytokinins is finely regulated by metabolic enzymes. LONELY GUY (LOG) was previously identified as a cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the direct activation pathway in rice (Oryza sativa) shoot meristems. In this work, nine Arabidopsis thaliana LOG genes (At LOG1 to LOG9) were predicted as homologs of rice LOG. Seven At LOGs, which are localized in the cytosol and nuclei, had enzymatic activities equivalent to that of rice LOG. Conditional overexpression of At LOGs in transgenic Arabidopsis reduced the content of N(6)-(Delta(2)-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) riboside 5'-phosphates and increased the levels of iP and the glucosides. Multiple mutants of At LOGs showed a lower sensitivity to iP riboside in terms of lateral root formation and altered root and shoot morphology. Analyses of At LOG promoter:beta-glucuronidase fusion genes revealed differential expression of LOGs in various tissues during plant development. Ectopic overexpression showed pleiotropic phenotypes, such as promotion of cell division in embryos and leaf vascular tissues, reduced apical dominance, and a delay of leaf senescence. Our results strongly suggest that the direct activation pathway via LOGs plays a pivotal role in regulating cytokinin activity during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis.
19841886	Identification and characterization of large-effect quantitative trait loci for grain yield under lowland drought stress in rice using bulk-segregant analysis.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	An F(4:5) population of 490 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Apo/(2*)Swarna was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects on grain yield under drought stress using bulk-segregant analysis (BSA). Swarna is an important rainfed lowland rice variety grown on millions of hectares in Asia, but is highly susceptible to drought and aerobic soil conditions. Apo is an aerobic-adapted variety with moderate tolerance to drought. Two rice microsatellite (RM) markers, RM324, and RM416, located on chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively, were shown via BSA to be strongly associated with yield under lowland drought stress. The effects of these QTL were tested in a total of eight hydrological environments over a period of 3 years. The QTL linked to RM416 (DTY(3.1)) had a large effect on grain yield under severe lowland drought stress, explaining about 31% of genetic variance for the trait (P < 0.0001). It also explained considerable variance for yield under mild stress in lowland conditions and aerobic environments. To our knowledge this is the first reported QTL that has a large effect on yield in both lowland drought and aerobic environments. The QTL linked to RM324 (DTY(2.1)) had a highly significant effect on grain yield in lowland drought stress (R(2) = 13-16%) and in two aerobic trials. The effect of these QTL on grain yield was verified to be not mainly due to phenology differences. Effects of DTY(3.1) on yield under stress have been observed in several other rice mapping populations studied at IRRI. Results of this study indicate that BSA is an effective method of identifying QTL alleles with large effects on rice yield under severe drought stress. The Apo alleles for these large-effect QTL for grain yield under drought and aerobic conditions may be immediately exploited in marker-assisted-breeding to improve the drought tolerance of Swarna.
19843335	Seed storage protein gene promoters contain conserved DNA motifs in Brassicaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Accurate computational identification of cis-regulatory motifs is difficult, particularly in eukaryotic promoters, which typically contain multiple short and degenerate DNA sequences bound by several interacting factors. Enrichment in combinations of rare motifs in the promoter sequence of functionally or evolutionarily related genes among several species is an indicator of conserved transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This provides a basis for the computational identification of cis-regulatory motifs.

RESULTS: We have used a discriminative seeding DNA motif discovery algorithm for an in-depth analysis of 54 seed storage protein (SSP) gene promoters from three plant families, namely Brassicaceae (mustards), Fabaceae (legumes) and Poaceae (grasses) using backgrounds based on complete sets of promoters from a representative species in each family, namely Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) respectively. We have identified three conserved motifs (two RY-like and one ACGT-like) in Brassicaceae and Fabaceae SSP gene promoters that are similar to experimentally characterized seed-specific cis-regulatory elements. Fabaceae SSP gene promoter sequences are also enriched in a novel, seed-specific E2Fb-like motif. Conserved motifs identified in Poaceae SSP gene promoters include a GCN4-like motif, two prolamin-box-like motifs and an Skn-1-like motif. Evidence of the presence of a variant of the TATA-box is found in the SSP gene promoters from the three plant families. Motifs discovered in SSP gene promoters were used to score whole-genome sets of promoters from Arabidopsis, soybean and rice. The highest-scoring promoters are associated with genes coding for different subunits or precursors of seed storage proteins.

CONCLUSION: Seed storage protein gene promoter motifs are conserved in diverse species, and different plant families are characterized by a distinct combination of conserved motifs. The majority of discovered motifs match experimentally characterized cis-regulatory elements. These results provide a good starting point for further experimental analysis of plant seed-specific promoters and our methodology can be used to unravel more transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in plants and other eukaryotes.
19847104	Role of auxin-responsive genes in biotic stress responses.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	Although the phytohormone auxin has been implicated primarily in developmental processes, some recent studies suggest its involvement in stress/defense responses as well. Recently, we identified auxin-responsive genes and reported their comprehensive transcript profiling during various stages of development and abiotic stress responses in crop plant rice. The analysis revealed tissue-specific and overlapping expression profiles of auxin-responsive genes during various stages of reproductive development. In addition, a large number of auxin-responsive genes were also found to be differentially expressed under various abiotic stress conditions. Here, we further analyze the expression profiles of auxin-responsive genes during various biotic stress conditions. Several auxin-responsive genes showed response to biotic stress as well. Our analysis provides evidence for role of auxin in plant defense responses and suggests cross-talk between auxin, abiotic stress and biotic stress signaling pathways.
19847266	Unexpected consequences of a sudden and massive transposon amplification on rice gene expression.	2009	Nature	High-copy-number transposable elements comprise the majority of eukaryotic genomes where they are major contributors to gene and genome evolution. However, it remains unclear how a host genome can survive a rapid burst of hundreds or thousands of insertions because such bursts are exceedingly rare in nature and therefore difficult to observe in real time. In a previous study we reported that in a few rice strains the DNA transposon mPing was increasing its copy number by approximately 40 per plant per generation. Here we exploit the completely sequenced rice genome to determine 1,664 insertion sites using high-throughput sequencing of 24 individual rice plants and assess the impact of insertion on the expression of 710 genes by comparative microarray analysis. We find that the vast majority of transposable element insertions either upregulate or have no detectable effect on gene transcription. This modest impact reflects a surprising avoidance of exon insertions by mPing and a preference for insertion into 5' flanking sequences of genes. Furthermore, we document the generation of new regulatory networks by a subset of mPing insertions that render adjacent genes stress inducible. As such, this study provides evidence for models first proposed previously for the involvement of transposable elements and other repetitive sequences in genome restructuring and gene regulation.
19851874	Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by qLTG3-1 controlling low-temperature germinability in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	The control of seed germination under environmental conditions, where plants will be grown, is important for the adaptability of plants. Low-temperature is one of the most common environmental stress factors that affect plant growth and development and places a major limit on crop productivity in cultivated areas. Previously, qLTG3-1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling low-temperature tolerance at the germination stage in rice (called low-temperature germinability) was identified, which encodes a protein of unknown function. To identify genes targeted by qLTG3-1, a genome-wide expression profiling analysis using the 44 K Rice Oligo microarray was performed. Because the expression of qLTG3-1 was dramatically increased at 1 day after incubation, the expression profiles at this time were compared between Hayamasari, which has a loss-of-function qLTG3-1 allele, and a near isogenic line with a functional allele. A total of 4,587 genes showed significant differences between their expression levels in the two lines. Most of these genes might be involved in the process of seed germination itself, and then a focus was made on qLTG3-1 dependently induced or suppressed genes, defined as 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes. Twenty-nine 'qLTG3-1 dependent' genes with diverse functions were categorized, implying that disruption of cellular homeostasis leads to a wide range of metabolic alterations and diverse cross-talk between various signaling pathways. In particular, genes involved in defense responses were up-regulated by qLTG3-1, indicating that qLTG3-1 expression is required for the expression of defense response genes in low-temperature germinability in rice.
19853963	Comparative proteomic analysis of the short-term responses of rice roots and leaves to cadmium.	2010	J Plant Physiol	Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential heavy metal that is recognized as a major environmental pollutant. While Cd responses and toxicities in some plant species have been well established, there are few reports about the effects of short-term exposure to Cd on rice, a model monocotyledonous plant, at the proteome level. To investigate the effect of Cd in rice, we monitored the influence of Cd exposure on root and leaf proteomes. After Cd treatment, root and leaf tissues were separately collected and leaf proteins were fractionated with polyethylene glycol. Differentially regulated proteins were selected after image analysis and identified using MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 36 proteins were up- or down-regulated following Cd treatment. As expected, total glutathione levels were significantly decreased in Cd-treated roots, and approximately half of the up-regulated proteins in roots were involved in responses to oxidative stress. These results suggested that prompt antioxidative responses might be necessary for the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in roots but not in leaves. In addition, RNA gel blot analysis showed that the proteins identified in the proteomic analysis were also differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our study provides insights into the integrated molecular mechanisms of early responses to Cd in rice.
19856189	Diversity of the Ty-1 copia retrotransposon Tos17 in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and the AA genome of the Oryza genus.	2009	Mol Genet Genomics	Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements, ubiquitous in Eukaryotic genomes, which have proven to be major genetic tools in determining phylogeny and structuring genetic diversity, notably in plants. We investigate here the diversity of the Ty1-copia retrotransposon Tos17 in the cultivated rice of Asian origin (Oryza sativa L.) and related AA genome species of the Oryza genus, to contribute understanding of the complex evolutionary history in this group of species through that of the element in the lineages. In that aim, we used a combination of Southern hybridization with a reverse transcriptase (RT) probe and an adapter-PCR mediated amplification, which allowed the sequencing of the genomic regions flanking Tos17 insertions. This analysis was carried out in a collection of 47 A-genome Oryza species accessions and 202 accessions of a core collection of Oryza sativa L. representative of the diversity of the species. Our Southern hybridization results show that Tos17 is present in all the accessions of the A-genome Oryza species, except for the South American species O. glumaepatula and the African species O. glaberrima and O. breviligulata. In O. sativa, the number of putative copies of Tos17 per accession ranged from 1 to 11 and multivariate analysis based on presence/absence of putative copies yielded a varietal clustering which is consistent with the isozyme classification of rice. Adapter PCR amplification and sequencing of flanking regions of Tos17 insertions in A-genome species other than O. sativa, followed by anchoring on the Nipponbare genome sequence, revealed 13 insertion sites of Tos17 in the surveyed O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata accessions, including one shared by both species. In O. sativa, the same approach revealed 25 insertions in the 6 varietal groups. Four insertion sites located on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, and 11 were found orthologous in O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The chromosome 1 insertion was also shared between O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata. The presence of Tos17 at three insertion sites was confirmed by retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) in a sample of O. sativa accessions. The first insertion, located on chromosome 3 was only found in two japonica accessions from the Bhutan region while the second insertion, located on chromosome 10 was specific to the varietal groups 1, 2, and 5. The third insertion located on chromosome 7 corresponds to the only insertion shown active in rice so far, notably in cv. Nipponbare, where it has been extensively used for insertion mutagenesis. This copy was only found in a few varieties of the japonica group 6 and in one group 5 accession. Taken together, these results confirm that Tos17 was probably present in the ancestor of A-genome species and that some copies of the element remained active in some Oryza lineages--notably in O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata--as well as in the indica and japonica O. sativa L. lineages.
19864426	Structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain of a plant NADPH oxidase and its functional implications.	2010	J Biol Chem	Plant NADPH oxidases (Rboh, for respiratory burst oxidase homolog) produce reactive oxygen species that are key regulators of various cellular events including plant innate immunity. Rbohs possess a highly conserved cytoplasmic N-terminal region containing two EF-hand motifs that regulate Rboh activity. Rice (Oryza sativa) RbohB (OsRbohB) is regulated by the direct binding of a small GTPase (Rac1) to this regulatory region as well as by Ca(2+) binding to the EF-hands. Here, we present the atomic structure of the N-terminal region of OsRbohB. The structure reveals that OsRbohB forms a unique dimer stabilized by swapping the EF-hand motifs. We identified two additional EF-hand-like motifs that were not predicted from sequence data so far. These EF-hand-like motifs together with the swapped EF-hands form a structure similar to that found in calcineurin B. We observed conformational changes mediated by Ca(2+) binding to only one EF-hand. Structure-based in vitro pulldown assays and NMR titration experiments defined the OsRac1 binding interface within the coiled-coil region created by swapping the EF-hands. In addition, we demonstrate a direct intramolecular interaction between the N and C terminus, and that the complete N-terminal cytoplasmic region is required for this interaction. The structural features and intramolecular interactions characterized here might be common elements shared by Rbohs that contribute to the regulation of reactive oxygen species production.
20514227	Identification and expression of cytokinin signaling and meristem identity genes in sulfur deficient grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.).	2009	Plant Signal Behav	In plants, cytokinin (CK) perception and signaling pathway is composed by a histidine kinase receptor (HK) and a response regulator (RR), the signal being mediated by a histidine phosphotransfer (HPt), as described in Arabidopsis, maize and rice. From database searches we identified in grapevine three HKs, three HPs, four A-type RRs and six B-type RRs, suggesting a common mechanism for grapevine. The phylogenetic analysis of these Vitis genes showed a variable but high degree of homology with Arabidopsis sequences. When sulfate was withdrawn from the culture medium (-S) of in vitro Vitis shoots, we assessed a significant reduction in shoot branching. To ascertain the crosstalk of S status with CK signaling in grapevine, control and -S grown shoots and control, -S and -CK cell suspensions were used as experimental systems. Real-time PCR was elected to quantify the expression of key genes. The expression of CK receptor genes was downregulated in -S cells while not affected in -CK cells. In differentiated shoots no response to -S was observed on those genes. A-type VvRRa4 was downregulated in -S or -CK cells while Vitis B-type RRs did not respond either to CK or S starvation. The results suggest that Vitis CK signaling pathway is affected by -S, although differently according to the model system. Transcription of Vitis apical meristem-identity genes VvWUS, VvCLV and VvSTM and axillary meristem genes VvBRC1, VvBRC2, VvLAS, VvRAX and VvREV was estimated and VvSTM and VvLAS showed to be downregulated in -S. Then, the expression levels of VvSTM and VvLAS make them strong candidates to be associated with the branching pattern of Vitis shoots in -S.
19880795	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is the major limiting factor of crop production on acid soils, but some plant species have evolved ways of detoxifying Al. Here, we report a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor ART1 (for Al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to Al tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). ART1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by Al treatment. ART1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells. A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants. Some of these genes were implicated in both internal and external detoxification of Al at different cellular levels. Our findings shed light on comprehensively understanding how plants detoxify aluminum to survive in an acidic environment.
19885651	Nucleotide diversity and molecular evolution of the PSY1 gene in Zea mays compared to some other grass species.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Phytoene synthase (PSY), which is encoded by the phytoene synthase 1 (PSY1) gene, is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the plant carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. In order to examine the genetic diversity and evolution pattern of PSY1 within the Andropogoneae, sequences of 76 accessions from 5 species (maize, teosinte, tripsacum, coix, and sorghum) of the Andropogoneae were tested, along with 4 accessions of rice (Oryza sativa L.) included as outliers. Both the number and the order of exons and introns were relatively conserved across the species tested. Three domains were identified in the coding sequence, including signal peptide (SP), PSY, and highly conserved squalene synthase (SQS) domain. Although no positive selection signal was detected at an overall coding level among all species tested, the SP domain and the region upstream of the SQS-PSY domain appear to have undergone rapid evolution, as evidenced by a high d (N)/d (S) ratio (>1.0). At the nucleotide level, positive selection and balancing selection were detected only among the yellow maize germplasm and the white maize germplasm, respectively. The phylogenetic tree based on full-length sequences of PSY1-like regions supported the monophyletic theory of the Andropogoneae and the closest relationship between Zea and Tripsacum among the Andropogoneae. Coix, which was theorized to have a closer relationship with maize due to similarities in morphology and chromosome number, has been shown in this study to have diverged relatively early from the other Andropogoneae, including maize.
19888555	RA68 is required for postmeiotic pollen development in Oryza sativa.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Postmeiotic development is a unique characteristic of flowering plants. During the development, microspores undergo two cycles of mitosis (PMI and PMII) and a subsequent maturation process to finally produce the mature pollen, but the mechanism underlying the development is still largely unknown. Here, we report on the roles of a novel gene, RA68, in postmeiotic pollen development in Oryza sativa. RA68 was expressed preferentially in shoots and flowers. In flowers, the transcript persisted from the floral organ differentiation to the mature pollen stages and showed preferential accumulation in male meiocytes, developing pollen and tapetal cells. RA68-deficient RNAi lines showed reduced seed setting and pollen viability but not an aberrant phenotype in vegetative organs. Knockdown of RA68 led to arrested PMI, smaller pollen grains with little or no starch, and aborted pollen but not severely distruped male meiosis. Additionally, no abnormality of anther wall development was observed in RA68-RNAi lines. RA68 may be required for postmeiotic pollen development by affecting PMI and starch accumulation.
19889878	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells.	2010	Plant Physiol	Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis are crucial for plant growth and development. Two HKT transporter/channel classes have been characterized that mediate either Na(+) transport or Na(+) and K(+) transport when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. However, the Na(+)/K(+) selectivities of the K(+)-permeable HKT transporters have not yet been studied in plant cells. One study expressing 5' untranslated region-modified HKT constructs in yeast has questioned the relevance of cation selectivities found in heterologous systems for selectivity predictions in plant cells. Therefore, here we analyze two highly homologous rice (Oryza sativa) HKT transporters in plant cells, OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2, that show differential K(+) permeabilities in heterologous systems. Upon stable expression in cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright-Yellow 2 cells, OsHKT2;1 mediated Na(+) uptake, but little Rb(+) uptake, consistent with earlier studies and new findings presented here in oocytes. In contrast, OsHKT2;2 mediated Na(+)-K(+) cotransport in plant cells such that extracellular K(+) stimulated OsHKT2;2-mediated Na(+) influx and vice versa. Furthermore, at millimolar Na(+) concentrations, OsHKT2;2 mediated Na(+) influx into plant cells without adding extracellular K(+). This study shows that the Na(+)/K(+) selectivities of these HKT transporters in plant cells coincide closely with the selectivities in oocytes and yeast. In addition, the presence of external K(+) and Ca(2+) down-regulated OsHKT2;1-mediated Na(+) influx in two plant systems, Bright-Yellow 2 cells and intact rice roots, and also in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, OsHKT transporter selectivities in plant cells are shown to depend on the imposed cationic conditions, supporting the model that HKT transporters are multi-ion pores.
19890663	Carotenoid biosynthesis genes in rice: structural analysis, genome-wide expression profiling and phylogenetic analysis.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	Carotenoids, important lipid-soluble antioxidants in photosynthetic tissues, are known to be completely absent in rice endosperm. Many studies, involving transgenic manipulations of carotenoid biosynthesis genes, have been performed to get carotenoid-enriched rice grain. Study of genes involved in their biosynthesis can provide further information regarding the abundance/absence of carotenoids in different tissues. We have identified 16 and 34 carotenoid biosynthesis genes in rice and Populus genomes, respectively. A detailed analysis of the domain structure of carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes in rice, Populus and Arabidopsis has shown that highly conserved catalytic domains, along with other domains, are present in these proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of rice genes with Arabidopsis and other characterized carotenoid biosynthesis genes has revealed that homologous genes exist in these plants, and the duplicated gene copies probably adopt new functions. Expression of rice and Populus genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA- and EST-based expression profiling. In rice, this analysis was complemented by real-time PCR, microarray and signature-based expression profiling, which reveal that carotenoid biosynthesis genes are highly expressed in light-grown tissues, have differential expression pattern during vegetative/reproductive development and are responsive to stress.
19891703	The rice yellow mottle virus P1 protein exhibits dual functions to suppress and activate gene silencing.	2010	Plant J	In plants RNA silencing is a host defense mechanism against viral infection, in which double-strand RNA is processed into 21-24-nt short interfering RNA (siRNA). Silencing spreads from cell to cell and systemically through a sequence-specific signal to limit the propagation of the virus. To counteract this defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors of silencing. The P1 protein encoded by the rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) displays suppression activity with variable efficiency, according to the isolates that they originated from. Here, we show that P1 proteins from two RYMV isolates displaying contrasting suppression strength reduced local silencing induced by single-strand and double-strand RNA in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This suppression was associated with a slight and a severe reduction in 21- and 24-nt siRNA accumulation, respectively. Unexpectedly, cell-to-cell movement and systemic propagation of silencing were enhanced in P1-expressing Nicotiana plants. When transgenically expressed in rice, P1 proteins induced specific deregulation of DCL4-dependent endogenous siRNA pathways, whereas the other endogenous pathways were not affected. As DCL4-dependent pathways play a key role in rice development, the expression of P1 viral proteins was associated with the same severe developmental defects in spikelets as in dcl4 mutants. Overall, our results demonstrate that a single viral protein displays multiple effects on both endogenous and exogenous silencing, not only in a suppressive but also in an enhancive manner. This suggests that P1 proteins play a key role in maintaining a subtle equilibrium between defense and counter-defense mechanisms, to insure efficient virus multiplication and the preservation of host integrity.
19891707	Role of hydroperoxide lyase in white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera Horváth)-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice, Oryza sativa L.	2010	Plant J	A pre-infestation of the white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera Horváth, conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under both laboratory and field conditions. The infestation of another planthopper species, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens Stål, did not significantly reduce the incidence of bacterial blight symptoms. A large-scale screening using a rice DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that WBPH infestation caused the upregulation of more defence-related genes than did BPH infestation. Hydroperoxide lyase 2 (OsHPL2), an enzyme for producing C(6) volatiles, was upregulated by WBPH infestation, but not by BPH infestation. One C(6) volatile, (E)-2-hexenal, accumulated in rice after WBPH infestation, but not after BPH infestation. A direct application of (E)-2-hexenal to a liquid culture of Xoo inhibited the growth of the bacterium. Furthermore, a vapour treatment of rice plants with (E)-2-hexenal induced resistance to bacterial blight. OsHPL2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants exhibited increased resistance to bacterial blight. Based on these data, we conclude that OsHPL2 and its derived (E)-2-hexenal play some role in WBPH-induced resistance in rice.
19892983	A type I-secreted, sulfated peptide triggers XA21-mediated innate immunity.	2009	Science	The rice Xa21 gene confers immunity to most strains of the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of biologically active fractions from Xoo supernatants led to the identification of a 194-amino acid protein designated Ax21 (activator of XA21-mediated immunity). A sulfated, 17-amino acid synthetic peptide (axY(S)22) derived from the N-terminal region of Ax21 is sufficient for activity, whereas peptides lacking tyrosine sulfation are biologically inactive. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we found that XA21 is required for axY(S)22 binding and recognition. axY(S)22 is 100% conserved in all analyzed Xanthomonas species, confirming that Ax21 is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and that XA21 is a pattern recognition receptor.
19898814	Combining DNA pooling with selective recombinant genotyping for increased efficiency in fine mapping.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	One of the key steps in positional cloning and marker-aided selection is to identify marker(s) tightly linked to the target gene (i.e., fine mapping). Selective genotyping such as selective recombinant genotyping (SRG) is commonly used in fine mapping for cost-saving. To further decrease genotyping effort and rapidly screen for tightly linked markers, we propose here a combined DNA pooling and SRG strategy. A two-stage pooled genotyping can be used for identifying recombinants between a pair of flanking markers more efficiently, and a joint use of bulked DNA analysis and two-stage pooling can also save cost for genotyping recombinants. The combined DNA pooling and SRG strategy can further be extended to fine mapping for polygenic traits. The numerical results based on hypothetical scenarios and an illustrative application to fine mapping of a mutant gene, called xl(t), in rice suggest that the proposed strategy can remarkably reduce genotyping amount compared with the conventional SRG.
19898828	Cloning and characterization of a putative GS3 ortholog involved in maize kernel development.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	The GS3 gene was the first identified gene controlling the grain size in rice. It has been proven to be involved in the evolution of grain size during domestication. We isolated the maize ortholog, ZmGS3 and investigated its role in the evolution of maize grain size. ZmGS3 has five exons encoding a protein with 198 amino acids, and has domains in common with the rice GS3 protein. Compared with teosinte, maize has reduced nucleotide diversity at ZmGS3, and the reduction is comparable to that found in neutrally evolving maize genes. No positive selection was detected along the length of the gene using either the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé or Tajima's D tests. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a distribution of maize sequences among two different clades, with one clade including related teosinte sequences. The nucleotide polymorphism analysis, selection test and phylogenetic analysis reveal that ZmGS3 has not been subjected to selection, and appears to be a neutrally evolving gene. In maize, ZmGS3 is primarily expressed in immature ears and kernels, implying a role in maize kernel development. Association mapping analysis revealed one polymorphism in the fifth exon that is significantly associated with kernel length in two environments. Also one polymorphism in the promoter region was found to affect hundred kernel weight in both environments. Collectively, these results imply that ZmGS3 is involved in maize kernel development but with different functional polymorphisms and thus, possibly different mechanisms from that of the rice GS3 gene.
19901325	The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The mechanism of floral organ specification is principally conserved in angiosperms, as demonstrated by the ABC model. By contrast, mechanisms that regulate the development of organs or structures specific to a group of species remain unclear. Grasses have unique inflorescence units, comprising spikelets and florets. In the genus Oryza (rice), the single spikelet consists of a fertile floret subtended by a lemma and a palea, two sterile lemmas, and rudimentary glumes. Each sterile lemma is a tiny glume-like organ with a smooth surface. Here, we have examined a long sterile lemma1 (g1) mutant, in which the sterile lemma is enlarged like the lemma. Detailed phenotypic analysis reveals that the large sterile lemma in the g1 mutant appears to be caused by homeotic transformation of the sterile lemma into a lemma, suggesting that G1 is involved in the repression of lemma identity to specify the sterile lemma. Gene isolation reveals that G1 is a member of a plant-specific gene family that encodes proteins with a previously uncharacterized domain, named here ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1). G1 mRNA is expressed in sterile lemma primordia throughout their development, and G1 protein is localized in the nucleus. A trans-activation assay using the yeast GAL4 system suggests that G1 is involved in transcriptional regulation. Repression of lemma identity by G1 is consistent with a hypothesis proposed to explain the morphological evolution of rice spikelets. We also show that a wild rice species, Oryza grandiglumis, that forms large sterile lemmas has serious mutations in the G1 gene.
19903225	Substrate selectivity of glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	Substrate selectivity of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 15) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was explored in a comparative study of acyltransferases from seven plant species. In vitro labeling of acyl carrier protein (ACP) with (14)C or (3)H showed that acyltransferase from chill-sensitive plants, such as rice that uses either oleic (18:1) or palmitic acid (16:0) as acyl donor at comparable rates, displays lower selectivity than the enzyme from chill-resistant plants, such as spinach, which preferentially uses oleic acid (18:1) rather than palmitic acid (16:0) as an acyl donor. This may be a result of the size and character of the substrate-binding pocket of acyltransferase. Homology modeling and protein structure-based sequence alignment of acyltransferases revealed that proteins from either chill-sensitive or chill-tolerant plants shared a highly conserved domain containing the proposed substrate-binding pocket. However, the aligned residues surrounding the substrate-binding pocket are highly heterogeneous and may have an influence mainly on the size of the substrate binding pockets of acyltransferases. The substrate selectivity of acyltransferase of rice can be improved by enlarging the substrate-binding pocket using molecular biological methods.
19903869	Rice MicroRNA effector complexes and targets.	2009	Plant Cell	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small silencing RNAs with regulatory roles in gene expression. miRNAs interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form effector complexes that cleave target mRNAs or repress translation. Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d). We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the four AGO1s. The RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and had increased accumulation of miRNA targets. AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized. The three AGO1s all have a strong preference for binding small RNAs (sRNAs) with 5' U and have Slicer activity. We cataloged the sRNAs in each AGO1 complex by deep sequencing and found that all three AGO1s predominantly bound known miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs were evenly distributed in the three AGO1 complexes, suggesting a redundant role for the AGO1s. Intriguingly, a subset of miRNAs were specifically incorporated into or excluded from one of the AGO1s, suggesting functional specialization among the AGO1s. Furthermore, we identified rice miRNA targets at a global level. The validated targets include transcription factors that control major stages of development and also genes involved in a variety of physiological processes, indicating a broad regulatory role for miRNAs in rice.
19903871	Silver ions increase auxin efflux independently of effects on ethylene response.	2009	Plant Cell	Silver nitrate and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) are often used to inhibit perception and biosynthesis, respectively, of the phytohormone ethylene. In the course of exploring the genetic basis of the extensive interactions between ethylene and auxin, we compared the effects of silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) and AVG on auxin responsiveness. We found that although AgNO(3) dramatically decreased root indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) responsiveness in inhibition of root elongation, promotion of DR5-beta-glucuronidase activity, and reduction of Aux/IAA protein levels, AVG had more mild effects. Moreover, we found that that silver ions, but not AVG, enhanced IAA efflux similarly in root tips of both the wild type and mutants with blocked ethylene responses, indicating that this enhancement was independent of ethylene signaling. Our results suggest that the promotion of IAA efflux by silver ions is independent of the effects of silver ions on ethylene perception. Although the molecular details of this enhancement remain unknown, our finding that silver ions can promote IAA efflux in addition to blocking ethylene signaling suggest that caution is warranted in interpreting studies using AgNO(3) to block ethylene signaling in roots.
19910532	A single plant resistance gene promoter engineered to recognize multiple TAL effectors from disparate pathogens.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas inject transcription-activator like (TAL) effector proteins that manipulate the hosts' transcriptome to promote disease. However, in some cases plants take advantage of this mechanism to trigger defense responses. For example, transcription of the pepper Bs3 and rice Xa27 resistance (R) genes are specifically activated by the respective TAL effectors AvrBs3 from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), and AvrXa27 from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Recognition of AvrBs3 was shown to be mediated by interaction with the corresponding UPT (UPregulated by TAL effectors) box UPT(AvrBs3) present in the promoter R gene Bs3 from the dicot pepper. In contrast, it was not known how the Xoo TAL effector AvrXa27 transcriptionally activates the matching R gene Xa27 from the monocot rice. Here we identified a 16-bp UPT(AvrXa27) box present in the rice Xa27 promoter that when transferred into the Bs3 promoter confers AvrXa27-dependent inducibility. We demonstrate that polymorphisms between the UPT(AvrXa27) box of the AvrXa27-inducible Xa27 promoter and the corresponding region of the noninducible xa27 promoter account for their distinct inducibility and affinity, with respect to AvrXa27. Moreover, we demonstrate that three functionally distinct UPT boxes targeted by separate TAL effectors retain their function and specificity when combined into one promoter. Given that many economically important xanthomonads deliver multiple TAL effectors, the engineering of R genes capable of recognizing multiple TAL effectors provides a potential approach for engineering broad spectrum and durable disease resistance.
19923234	OsKu70 is associated with developmental growth and genome stability in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	The cellular functions of Ku70 in repair of DNA double-stranded breaks and telomere regulation have been described in a wide range of organisms. In this study, we identified the rice (Oryza sativa) Ku70 homolog (OsKu70) from the rice genome database. OsKu70 transcript was detected constitutively in every tissue and developmental stage examined and also in undifferentiated callus cells in rice. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down experiments revealed that OsKu70 physically interacts with OsKu80. We obtained loss-of-function osku70 T-DNA knockout mutant lines and constructed transgenic rice plants that overexpress the OsKu70 gene in the sense (35S:OsKu70) or antisense (35S:anti-OsKu70) orientation. The homozygous G2 osku70 mutant lines were more sensitive than wild-type plants to a DNA-damaging agent (0.01%-0.05% methyl-methane sulfonate), consistent with the notion that OsKu70 participates in the DNA repair mechanism. Terminal restriction fragment analysis revealed that telomeres in homozygous G2 osku70 mutants were markedly longer (10-20 kb) than those in wild-type plants (5-10 kb), whereas telomere length in heterozygous G2 osku70 mutant and T2 OsKu70-overexpressing transgenic (35S:OsKu70) rice resembled that of the wild-type plant. In contrast to what was observed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) atku70 mutants, homozygous G2 osku70 rice plants displayed severe developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs under normal growth conditions, resulting in sterile flowers. Analysis of meiotic progression in pollen mother cells demonstrated that up to 11.1% (seven of 63) of G2 mutant anaphase cells displayed one or more chromosomal fusions. These results suggest that OsKu70 is required for the maintenance of chromosome stability and normal developmental growth in rice plants.
19924544	Functional and composition differences between mitochondrial complex II in Arabidopsis and rice are correlated with the complex genetic history of the enzyme.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Complex II plays a central role in mitochondrial metabolism as a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the composition and function of the plant enzyme has been elusive and differs from the well-characterised enzymes in mammals and bacteria. Herewith, we demonstrate that mitochondrial Complex II from Arabidopsis and rice differ significantly in several aspects: (1) Stability-Rice complex II in contrast to Arabidopsis is not stable when resolved by native electrophoresis and activity staining. (2) Composition-Arabidopsis complex II contains 8 subunits, only 7 of which have homologs in the rice genome. SDH 1 and 2 subunits display high levels of amino acid identity between two species, while the remainder of the subunits are not well conserved at a sequence level, indicating significant divergence. (3) Gene expression-the pairs of orthologous SDH1 and SDH2 subunits were universally expressed in both Arabidopsis and rice. The very divergent genes for SDH3 and SDH4 were co-expressed in both species, consistent with their functional co-ordination to form the membrane anchor. The plant-specific SDH5, 6 and 7 subunits with unknown functions appeared to be differentially expressed in both species. (4) Biochemical regulation -succinate-dependent O(2) consumption and SDH activity of isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria were substantially stimulated by ATP, but a much more minor effect of ATP was observed for the rice enzyme. The ATP activation of succinate-dependent reduction of DCPIP in frozen-thawed and digitonin-solubilised mitochondrial samples, and with or without the uncoupler CCCP, indicate that the differential ATP effect on SDH is not via the protonmotive force but likely due to an allosteric effect on the plant SDH enzyme itself, in contrast to the enzyme in other organisms.
19926801	The Gibberellic Acid Stimulated-Like gene family in maize and its role in lateral root development.	2010	Plant Physiol	In an approach to study lateral root development in monocots, genome-wide searches for homologs of the Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-like (GAST-like) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) were carried out. Six novel GAST-like genes in rice and 10 members of the gene family in maize, which were designated ZmGSL (for Z. mays Gibberellic Acid Stimulated-Like), were identified. The ZmGSL family encodes small proteins of 75 to 128 amino acids, which are characterized by a conserved 59 to 64 amino acid C-terminal domain. Within this domain, 17 amino acids, including 12 cysteines, are perfectly conserved. The transcript of the ZmGSL1 gene is differentially spliced into the alternative variants ZmGSL1a and ZmGSL1b, the latter of which is translated into a premature protein that lacks the C-terminal domain. The presence of an additional N-terminal cleavable signal sequence in eight of the 10 ZmGSL proteins suggests that they are secreted into the extracellular matrix. In-depth root-specific gene expression analyses carried out in the wild type and the lateral root mutants lrt1 and rum1 suggest a role for ZmGSL genes in early lateral root development, which is likely regulated by gibberellic acid. Expression patterns of ZmGSL1a and ZmGSL1b propose antagonistic functions of these splice variants during early lateral root formation.
19930558	Genome-wide analysis of major intrinsic proteins in the tree plant Populus trichocarpa: characterization of XIP subfamily of aquaporins from evolutionary perspective.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Members of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) include water-conducting aquaporins and glycerol-transporting aquaglyceroporins. MIPs play important role in plant-water relations. The model plants Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize contain more than 30 MIPs and based on phylogenetic analysis they can be divided into at least four subfamilies. Populus trichocarpa is a model tree species and provides an opportunity to investigate several tree-specific traits. In this study, we have investigated Populus MIPs (PtMIPs) and compared them with their counterparts in Arabidopsis, rice and maize.

RESULTS: Fifty five full-length MIPs have been identified in Populus genome. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that Populus has a fifth uncharacterized subfamily (XIPs). Three-dimensional models of all 55 PtMIPs were constructed using homology modeling technique. Aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filters, characteristics of loops responsible for solute selectivity (loop C) and gating (loop D) and group conservation of small and weakly polar interfacial residues have been analyzed. Majority of the non-XIP PtMIPs are similar to those in Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Additional XIPs were identified from database search and 35 XIP sequences from dicots, fungi, moss and protozoa were analyzed. Ar/R selectivity filters of dicots XIPs are more hydrophobic compared to fungi and moss XIPs and hence they are likely to transport hydrophobic solutes. Loop C is longer in one of the subgroups of dicot XIPs and most probably has a significant role in solute selectivity. Loop D in dicot XIPs has higher number of basic residues. Intron loss is observed on two occasions: once between two subfamilies of eudicots and monocot and in the second instance, when dicot and moss XIPs diverged from fungi. Expression analysis of Populus MIPs indicates that Populus XIPs don't show any tissue-specific transcript abundance.

CONCLUSION: Due to whole genome duplication, Populus has the largest number of MIPs identified in any single species. Non-XIP MIPs are similar in all four plant species considered in this study. Small and weakly polar residues at the helix-helix interface are group conserved presumably to maintain the hourglass fold of MIP channels. Substitutions in ar/R selectivity filter, insertion/deletion in loop C, increasing basic nature of loop D and loss of introns are some of the events occurred during the evolution of dicot XIPs.
19933265	Vacuolar processing enzyme plays an essential role in the crystalline structure of glutelin in rice seed.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	To identify the function of genes that regulate the processing of proglutelin, we performed an analysis of glup3 mutants, which accumulates excess amounts of proglutelin and lack the vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE). VPE activity in developing seeds from glup3 lines was reduced remarkably compared with the wild type. DNA sequencing of the VPE gene in glup3 mutants revealed either amino acid substitutions or the appearance of a stop codon within the coding region. Microscopic observations showed that alpha-globulin and proglutelin were distributed homogeneously within glup3 protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), and that glup3 PSVs lacked the crystalline lattice structure typical of wild-type PSVs. This suggests that the processing of proglutelin by VPE in rice is essential for proper PSV structure and compartmentalization of storage proteins. Growth retardation in glup3 seedlings was also observed, indicating that the processing of proglutelin influences early seedling development. These findings indicate that storage of glutelin in its mature form as a crystalline structure in PSVs is required for the rapid use of glutelin as a source of amino acids during early seedling development. In conclusion, VPE plays an important role in the formation of protein crystalline structures in PSVs.
19933266	Knock-down of OsDCL2 in rice negatively affects maintenance of the endogenous dsRNA virus, Oryza sativa endornavirus.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	An endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which has recently been recognized as the dsRNA virus Oryza sativa endornavirus (OsEV), is found in many strains of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). Small RNAs derived from OsEV dsRNA were detected, indicating that the RNA silencing machinery recognizes OsEV dsRNA. The existence of OsEV in knock-down (KD) lines of five genes of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (OsRDR1-OsRDR5) or two genes of Dicer-like protein (OsDCL2 or OsDCL3a) was examined to characterize the relationship between the host RNA silencing system and the propagation of this dsRNA virus. OsEV was not detected in OsRDR4-KD or OsDCL2-KD T(1) lines. We attempted to introduce OsEV into these KD lines by crossing them with OsEV-carrying plants because of the efficient transmission of OsEV to F(1) plants via pollen or ova. All OsRDR4-KD but only some OsDCL2-KD F(1) plants contained OsEV. Some OsDCL2-KD F(1) plants consisted of OsEV-carrying and OsEV-free cells. These results suggest that the maintenance of OsEV is unstable in OsDCL2-KD plants. Furthermore, the amount of OsEV-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) in the OsDCL2-KD plants increased relative to the wild type. This increased level of vsiRNA may cause OsEV instability during cell division.
19933267	PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2), encoding a SEPALLATA subfamily MADS-box protein, positively controls spikelet meristem identity in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	In rice panicle development, new meristems are generated sequentially in an organized manner and acquire their identity in a time- and position-dependent manner. In the panicle of the panicle phytomer2-1 (pap2-1) mutant, the pattern of meristem initiation is disorganized and newly formed meristems show reduced competency to become spikelet meristems, resulting in the transformation of early arising spikelets into rachis branches. In addition, rudimentary glumes and sterile lemmas, the outermost organs of the spikelet, elongate into a leafy morphology. We propose that PAP2 is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity. Map-based cloning revealed that PAP2 encodes OsMADS34, a member of the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily of MADS-box proteins. PAP2/OsMADS34 belongs to the LOFSEP subgroup of MADS-box genes that show grass-specific diversification caused by gene duplication events. All five SEP subfamily genes in rice are expressed exclusively during panicle development, while their spatial and temporal expression patterns vary. PAP2 expression starts the earliest among the five SEP genes, and a low but significant level of PAP2 mRNA was detected in the inflorescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early development of spikelet formation. Our study provides new evidence supporting the hypothesis that the genes of the LOFSEP subgroup control developmental processes that are unique to grass species.
19933874	Erect panicle2 encodes a novel protein that regulates panicle erectness in indica rice.	2010	Genetics	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence (panicle) architecture is an important agronomic trait for rice breeding. A number of high-yielding japonica rice strains, characterized by an erect panicle (EP) of their architecture, have been released as commercial varieties in China. But no EP-type indica varieties are released so far. Here, we identified two allelic erect-panicle mutants in indica rice, erect panicle2-1 (ep2-1) and erect panicle2-2 (ep2-2), exhibiting the characteristic erect panicle phenotype. Both mutants were derived from spontaneous mutation. We cloned the EP2 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy, and a transgenic complementation test rescued the phenotype of ep2-1. Anatomical investigations revealed that the ep2 mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in ep2 mutants. It was shown that EP2 was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR. EP2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum with unknown biochemical function. In addition, EP2 also regulates other panicle characteristics, such as panicle length and grain size, but grain number per panicle shows little change, indicating that the mutation of the ep2 gene could be applied in EP-type indica rice breeding.
19938377	Evidence for a role of hexokinases as conserved glucose sensors in both monocot and dicot plant species.	2009	Plant Signal Behav	The role of the hexokinases (HXKs) as glucose (Glc) sensors has been mainly demonstrated for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HXK1 (AtHXK1) but has yet to be shown in other plant species. In our recent publication, we reported that two rice (Oryza sativa) HXKs, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, also function as Glc sensors. These two enzymes harbor both mitochondrial targeting peptides (mTPs) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and we confirmed their dual-targeting ability to nuclei and mitochondria using GFP fusion experiments. Consistently, it has been previously known that AtHXK1 is predominantly associated with mitochondria but is also present in nuclei in vivo at appreciable levels. Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their catalytically inactive mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutant. In addition, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) gene in response to glucose treatment. Our results thus provided evidence that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 can function as glucose sensors in rice. Hence, the available current data suggest that the role of the HXKs as Glc sensors may be conserved in both monocot and dicot plant species, and that the nuclear localization of AtHXK1, OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 may be critical for Glc sensing and signaling.
19949766	Mapping and validation of quantitative trait loci for spikelets per panicle and 1,000-grain weight in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Theor Appl Genet	This study identified four and five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 1,000-grain weight (TGW) and spikelets per panicle (SPP), respectively, using rice recombinant inbred lines. QTLs for the two traits (SPP3a and TGW3a, TGW3b and SPP3b) were simultaneously identified in the two intervals between RM3400 and RM3646 and RM3436 and RM5995 on chromosome 3. To validate QTLs in the interval between RM3436 and RM5995, a BC(3)F(2) population was obtained, in which TGW3b and SPP3b were simultaneously mapped to a 2.6-cM interval between RM15885 and W3D16. TGW3b explained 50.4% of the phenotypic variance with an additive effect of 1.81 g. SPP3b explained 29.1% of the phenotypic variance with an additive effect of 11.89 spikelets. The interval had no effect on grain yield because it increased SPP but decreased TGW and vice versa. Grain shape was strongly associated with TGW and was used for QTL analysis in the BC(3)F(2) population. Grain length, grain width, and grain thickness were also largely controlled by TGW3b. At present, it is not clear whether one pleiotropic QTL or two linked QTLs were located in the interval. However, the conclusion could be made ultimately by isolation of TGW3b. The strategy for TGW3b isolation is discussed.
19949767	Dissection of a QTL reveals an adaptive, interacting gene complex associated with transgressive variation for flowering time in rice.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	A days to heading QTL (dth1.1) located on the short arm of rice chromosome 1 was sub-divided into eight sub-introgression lines (SILs) to analyze the genetic basis of transgressive variation for flowering time. Each SIL contained one or more introgression(s) from O. rufipogon in the genetic background of the elite Oryza sativa cultivar, Jefferson. Each introgression was defined at high resolution using molecular markers and those in the dth1.1 region were associated with the presence of one or more flowering time genes (GI, SOC1, FT-L8, EMF1, and PNZIP). SILs and controls were evaluated for flowering time under both short- and long-day growing conditions. Under short-day lengths, lines with introgressions carrying combinations of linked flowering time genes (GI/SOC1, SOC1/FT-L8, GI/SOC1/FT-L8 and EMF1/PNZIP) from the late parent, O. rufipogon, flowered earlier than the recurrent parent, Jefferson, while recombinant lines carrying smaller introgressions marked by the presence of GI, SOC1, EMF1 or PNZIP alone no longer flowered early. Under long-day length, lines carrying SOC1/FT-L8, SOC1 or PNZIP flowered early, while those carrying GI or EMF1 delayed flowering. Across all experiments and in the field, only SIL_SOC1/FT-L8 was consistently early. A preliminary yield evaluation indicated that the transgressive early flowering observed in several of the SILs was also associated with a measurable and positive effect on yield. These SILs represent a new source of variation that can be used in breeding programs to manipulate flowering time in rice cultivars without the reduction in yield that is often associated with early maturing phenotypes.
19953291	Contribution of chloroplast biogenesis to carbon-nitrogen balance during early leaf development in rice.	2010	J Plant Res	Chloroplast biogenesis is most significant during the changes in cellular organization associated with leaf development in higher plants. To examine the physiological relationship between developing chloroplasts and host leaf cells during early leaf development, we investigated changes in the carbon and nitrogen contents in leaves at the P4 developmental stage of rice, during which leaf blade structure is established and early events of chloroplast differentiation occur. During the P4 stage, carbon content on a dry mass basis remained constant, whereas the nitrogen content decreased by 30%. Among carbohydrates, sucrose and starch accumulated to high levels early in the P4 stage, and glucose, fructose and cellulose degradation increased during the mid-to-late P4 stage. In the chloroplast-deficient leaves of the virescent-1 mutant of rice, however, the carbon and nitrogen contents, as well as the C/N ratio during the P4 stage, were largely unaffected. These observations suggest that developing rice leaves function as sink organs at the P4 stage, and that chloroplast biogenesis and carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the leaf cell is regulated independently at this stage.
19957018	A gene family encoding RING finger proteins in rice: their expansion, expression diversity, and co-expressed genes.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	The proteins harboring RING finger motif(s) have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions that are relevant to a variety of cellular processes. In an effort to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of the rice RING finger protein family, we have attempted to determine their genomic locations, expression diversity, and co-expressed genes via in silico analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A total of 425 retrieved genes appear to be distributed over all 12 of the chromosomes of rice with different distributions, and are reflective of the evolutionary dynamics of the rice genome. A genome-wide dataset harboring 155 gene expression omnibus sample plates evidenced some degree of differential evolutionary fates between members of RING-H2 and RING-HC types. Additionally, responses to abiotic stresses, such as salinity and drought, demonstrated that some degree of expression diversity existed between members of the RING finger protein genes. Interestingly, we determined that one RING-H2 finger protein gene (Os04g51400) manifested striking differences in expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses between leaf and culm-node tissues, further revealing responses highly similar to the majority of randomly selected co-expressed genes. The gene network of genes co-expressed with Os04g51400 may suggest some role in the salt response of the gene. These findings may shed further light on the evolutionary dynamics and molecular functional diversity of these proteins in complex cellular regulations.
19965875	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Expression in Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology was used to test for transport activity of the five sucrose transporter (SUT) homologs from rice. Expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 resulted in sucrose-dependent currents that were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamping. We examined the transport kinetics, substrate specificity and pH dependence of sucrose transport and K(0.5) for sucrose. OsSUT1 showed similar features to those of other type II SUTs from monocots examined previously, with a K(0.5) value of 7.50 mM at pH 5.6. In contrast, OsSUT5 had a higher substrate affinity (K(0.5) = 2.32 mM at pH 5.6), less substrate specificity and less pH dependence compared with all type II SUTs tested to date. Regulation of the rice SUTs, as well as ZmSUT1 from maize and HvSUT1 from barley, by reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione was tested. GSSG and GSH were found to have no significant effect on the activity of sucrose transporters when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In conclusion, differences in transport activity between OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 indicate that type II SUTs have a range of transport activities that are tuned to their function in the plant.
19965963	Reactive oxygen species are involved in plant defense against a gall midge.	2010	Plant Physiol	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in plant defense against pathogens, but evidence for their role in defense against insects is still preliminary and inconsistent. In this study, we examined the potential role of ROS in defense of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) against Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae. Rapid and prolonged accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was detected in wheat plants at the attack site during incompatible interactions. Increased accumulation of both H(2)O(2) and superoxide was detected in rice plants during nonhost interactions with the larvae. No increase in accumulation of either H(2)O(2) or superoxide was observed in wheat plants during compatible interactions. A global analysis revealed changes in the abundances of 250 wheat transcripts and 320 rice transcripts encoding proteins potentially involved in ROS homeostasis. A large number of transcripts encoded class III peroxidases that increased in abundance during both incompatible and nonhost interactions, whereas the levels of these transcripts decreased in susceptible wheat during compatible interactions. The higher levels of class III peroxidase transcripts were associated with elevated enzymatic activity of peroxidases at the attack site in plants during incompatible and nonhost interactions. Overall, our data indicate that class III peroxidases may play a role in ROS generation in resistant wheat and nonhost rice plants during response to Hessian fly attacks.
19969519	Copper delivery by the copper chaperone for chloroplast and cytosolic copper/zinc-superoxide dismutases: regulation and unexpected phenotypes in an Arabidopsis mutant.	2009	Mol Plant	Copper (Cu) is an important mineral nutrient found in chloroplasts as a cofactor associated with plastocyanin and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD). Superoxide dismutases are metallo-enzymes found in most oxygenic organisms with proposed roles in reducing oxidative stress. Several recent studies in Arabidopsis have shown that microRNAs and a SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like7 (SPL7) transcription factor function to down-regulate the expression of many Cu-proteins, including Cu/ZnSOD in both plastids and the cytosol, during growth on low Cu. Plants contain the Cu Chaperone for SOD (CCS) that delivers Cu to Cu/ZnSODs, and, in Arabidopsis, both cytosolic and plastidic CCS versions are encoded by one gene. In this study, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis CCS transcript levels are regulated by Cu, mediated by microRNA 398 that was not previously predicted to target CCS. The microRNA target site is conserved in CCS of Oryza sativa. The data suggest that Cu-regulated microRNAs may have more mRNA targets than was previously predicted. A CCS null mutant has no measurable SOD activity in the chloroplast and cytosol, indicating an absolute requirement for CCS. When the CCS null mutant was grown on high Cu media, it lacked both Fe superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) and Cu/ZnSOD activity. However, this did not lead to a visual phenotype and no photosynthetic deficiencies were detected, even after high light stress. These results indicate that Cu/ZnSOD is not a pivotal component of the photosynthetic anti-oxidant system during growth in laboratory conditions.
20003164	Functional conservation and diversification of class E floral homeotic genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2010	Plant J	Mutant analyses in different eudicotyledonous flowering plants demonstrated that SEPALLATA-like MADS-box genes are required for the specification of sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, and for floral determinacy, thus defining class E floral organ identity genes. SEP-like genes encode MADS-domain transcription factors and constitute an angiosperm-specific gene clade whose members show remarkably different degrees of redundancy and sub-functionalization within eudicots. To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of SEP-like genes throughout the angiosperms we have knocked down SEP-like genes of rice (Oryza sativa), a distant relative of eudicots within the flowering plants. Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma-like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy. Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs. This mimics the phenotype observed with the sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4 quadruple mutant of Arabidopsis. Detailed analyses of the spatial and temporal mRNA expression and protein interaction patterns corresponding to the different rice SEP-like genes show strong similarities, but also gene-specific differences. These findings reveal conservation of SEP-like genes in specifying floral determinacy and organ identities since the separation of eudicots and monocots about 150 million years ago. However, they indicate also monocot-specific neo- and sub-functionalization events and hence underscore the evolutionary dynamics of SEP-like genes. Moreover, our findings corroborate the view that the lodicules of grasses are homologous to eudicot petals.
20007444	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been identified in various signaling pathways involved in plant development and stress responses. We identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant (drought-hypersensitive mutant1 [dsm1]) of a putative MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) gene in rice (Oryza sativa). Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages. The dsm1 mutants lost water more rapidly than wild-type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought-sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants. DSM1-RNA interference lines were also hypersensitive to drought stress. The predicted DSM1 protein belongs to a B3 subgroup of plant Raf-like MAPKKKs and was localized in the nucleus. By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold. Microarray analysis revealed that two peroxidase (POX) genes, POX22.3 and POX8.1, were sharply down-regulated compared to wild type, suggesting that DSM1 may be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the dsm1 mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity. Overexpression of DSM1 in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage. Together, these results suggest that DSM1 might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice.
20007447	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution.	2010	Plant Physiol	Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.
20008096	Dynamic landscapes of four histone modifications during deetiolation in Arabidopsis.	2009	Plant Cell	Although landscapes of several histone marks are now available for Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, such profiles remain static and do not provide information about dynamic changes of plant epigenomes in response to developmental or environmental cues. Here, we analyzed the effects of light on four histone modifications (acetylation and trimethylation of lysines 9 and 27 on histone H3: H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3, respectively). Our genome-wide profiling of H3K9ac and H3K27ac revealed that these modifications are nontransposable element gene-specific. By contrast, we found that H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 target nontransposable element genes, but also intergenic regions and transposable elements. Specific light conditions affected the number of modified regions as well as the overall correlation strength between the presence of specific modifications and transcription. Furthermore, we observed that acetylation marks not only ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 and HY5-HOMOLOG upon deetiolation, but also their downstream targets. We found that the activation of photosynthetic genes correlates with dynamic acetylation changes in response to light, while H3K27ac and H3K27me3 potentially contribute to light regulation of the gibberellin metabolism. Thus, this work provides a dynamic portrait of the variations in histone modifications in response to the plant's changing light environment and strengthens the concept that histone modifications represent an additional layer of control for light-regulated genes involved in photomorphogenesis.
20009022	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis.	2009	Plant Cell	In rice (Oryza sativa), brassinosteroids (BRs) induce cell elongation at the adaxial side of the lamina joint to promote leaf bending. We identified a rice mutant (ili1-D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that caused by BR treatment. The ili1-D mutant overexpresses an HLH protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana Paclobutrazol Resistance1 (PRE1) and the human Inhibitor of DNA binding proteins. Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending. ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis. Thus, ILI1 and PRE1 may inactivate inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization. BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1. The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest. These results demonstrate a conserved mechanism of BR regulation of plant development through a pair of antagonizing HLH/bHLH transcription factors that act downstream of BZR1 in Arabidopsis and rice.

20012261	Fine mapping of a gene for non-pollen type thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Theor Appl Genet	The thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) lines play a crucial role in two-line hybrid rice production. For a practical TGMS line, the stability of male sterility is one of the most important technical indicators. In this study, XianS, a spontaneous mutant with stable male sterility from an indica rice cultivar Xianhuangzhan, was classified as a non-pollen type TGMS line. The critical non-pollen sterility point temperature of XianS was determined as 27 degrees C. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the non-pollen sterility in XianS was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using SSR markers and bulked segregant analysis, the TGMS gene in XianS was fine mapped to a 183 kb interval between RMAN81 and RMX21 on chromosome 2. Two markers, 4039-1 and RMX14 completely cosegregated with this gene. Allelism test indicated that the non-pollen phenotype in seven non-pollen type TGMS lines from different sources, XianS, AnnongS-1, Q523S, Q524S, N28S, G421S, and Q527S is caused by the same TGMS gene. Although the location of TGMS gene in XianS is close to the gene OsNAC6, a previously identified candidate gene of tms5 in AnnongS-1, the sequence of OsNAC6 and its promoter region was identical in TGMS line XianS, AnnongS-1, and wild-type Xianhuangzhan. These results suggest that the non-pollen type TGMS trait probably be controlled by the same TGMS gene in different TGMS rice lines, but its real candidate gene still need to be further studied and identified.
20012263	Identification and analysis of QTLs controlling cold tolerance at the reproductive stage and validation of effective QTLs in cold-tolerant genotypes of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Low temperature or cold stress is one of the major constraints of rice production and productivity in temperate rice-growing countries and high-altitude areas in the tropics. Even though low temperature affects the rice plant in all stages of growth, the percent seed set is damaged severely by cold and this reduces the yield potential of cultivars significantly. In this study, a new source of cold-tolerant line, IR66160-121-4-4-2, was used as a donor parent with a cold-sensitive cultivar, Geumobyeo, to produce 153 F(8) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. QTL analysis with 175 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and composite interval mapping identified three main-effect QTLs (qPSST-3, qPSST-7, and qPSST-9) on chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. The SSR markers RM569, RM1377, and RM24545 were linked to the identified QTLs for cold tolerance with respect to percent seed set using cold-water (18-19 degrees C) irrigation in the field and controlled air temperature (17 degrees C) in the greenhouse. The total phenotypic variation for cold tolerance contributed by the three QTLs was 27.4%. RILs with high percent seed set under cold stress were validated with linked DNA markers and by haplotype analysis that revealed the contribution of progenitor genomes from the tropical japonica cultivar Jimbrug (Javanica) and temperate japonica cultivar Shen-Nung89-366. Three QTLs contributed by the cold-tolerant parent were identified which showed additive effect on percent seed set under cold treatment. This study demonstrated the utility of a new phenotyping method as well as the identification of SSR markers associated with QTLs for selection of cold-tolerant genotypes to improve temperate rice production.
20015061	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling.	2010	Plant J	Jasmonates (JAs) are lipid-derived regulators that play crucial roles in both host immunity and development. We recently identified the NAC transcription factor RIM1 as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV). Here, we report that RIM1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of JA signaling and is degraded in response to JA treatment via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Plants carrying rim1 mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition. The expression profiles of the mutants were significantly correlated with those of JA-treated wild-type plants without accumulation of endogenous JA, indicating that RIM1 functions as a component of JA signaling. The expression of genes encoding JA biosynthetic enzymes (lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase 2 (AOS2) and OPDA reductase 7 (OPR7)) was up-regulated in the rim1 mutants under normal conditions, and a rapid and massive accumulation of endogenous JA was detected in the mutants after wounding. These results suggest that RIM1 may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway.
20017947	Over-expression of miR172 causes loss of spikelet determinacy and floral organ abnormalities in rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a crucial role in many developmental and physiological processes in plants. miRNAs act to repress expression of their target genes via mRNA cleavage or translational repression. Dozens of miRNA families have been identified in rice, 21 of which are conserved between rice and Arabidopsis. miR172 is a conserved miRNA family which has been shown to regulate expression of APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription factors in Arabidopsis and maize. The rice genome encodes five AP2-like genes predicted to be targets of miR172. To determine whether these rice AP2-like genes are regulated by miR172 and investigate the function of the target genes, we studied the effect of over-expressing two members of the miR172 family on rice plant development.

RESULTS: Analysis of miR172 expression showed that it is most highly expressed in late vegetative stages and developing panicles. Analyses of expression of three miR172 targets showed that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) and Os03g60430 have high expression in developing panicles. Expression of miR172 was not inversely correlated with expression of its targets although miR172-mediated cleavage of SNB was detected by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Over-expression of miR172b in rice delayed the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem, and resulted in floral and seed developmental defects, including changes to the number and identity of floral organs, lower fertility and reduced seed weight. Plants over-expressing miR172b not only phenocopied the T-DNA insertion mutant of SNB but showed additional defects in floret development not seen in the snb mutant. However SNB expression was not reduced in the miR172b over-expression plants.

CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypes resulting from over-expression of miR172b suggests it represses SNB and at least one of the other miR172 targets, most likely Os03g60430, indicating roles for other AP2-like genes in rice floret development. miR172 and the AP2-like genes had overlapping expression patterns in rice and their expression did not show an obvious negative correlation. There was not a uniform decrease in the expression of the AP2-like miR172 target mRNAs in the miR172b over-expression plants. These observations are consistent with miR172 functioning via translational repression or with expression of the AP2-like genes being regulated by a negative feedback loop.
20018598	MEF9, an E-subclass pentatricopeptide repeat protein, is required for an RNA editing event in the nad7 transcript in mitochondria of Arabidopsis.	2010	Plant Physiol	RNA editing in plants alters specific nucleotides from C to U in mRNAs in plastids and in mitochondria. I here characterize the nuclear gene MITOCHONDRIAL EDITING FACTOR9 (MEF9) that is required for RNA editing of the site nad7-200 in the nad7 mitochondrial mRNA in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The MEF9 protein belongs to the E subfamily of pentatricopeptide repeat proteins and unlike the three previously identified mitochondrial editing factors MEF1 and MEF11 in Arabidopsis and OGR1 in rice (Oryza sativa) does not contain a DYW C-terminal domain. In addition, the E domain is incomplete, but seems to be functionally required, since one of the two independent EMS mutants encodes a MEF9 protein truncated by a stop codon at the beginning of the E domain. In both mutant plants premature stop codons in MEF9 inactivate RNA editing at site nad7-200. The homozygous mutant plants are viable and develop rather normally. The lack of RNA editing at site nad7-200 thus seems to be tolerated although this editing event is conserved in most plant species or the genomic sequence already codes for a T at this position, resulting in a generally conserved amino acid codon.
20018603	Novel bifunctional nucleases, OmBBD and AtBBD1, are involved in abscisic acid-mediated callose deposition in Arabidopsis.	2010	Plant Physiol	Screening of the expressed sequence tag library of the wild rice species Oryza minuta revealed an unknown gene that was rapidly and strongly induced in response to attack by a rice fungal pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae) and an insect (Nilaparvata lugens) and by wounding, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate treatments. Its recombinant protein was identified as a bifunctional nuclease with both RNase and DNase activities in vitro. This gene was designated OmBBD (for O. minuta bifunctional nuclease in basal defense response). Overexpression of OmBBD in an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) model system caused the constitutive expression of the PDF1.2, ABA1, and AtSAC1 genes, which are involved in priming ABA-mediated callose deposition. This activation of defense responses led to an increased resistance against Botrytis cinerea. atbbd1, the knockout mutant of the Arabidopsis ortholog AtBBD1, was susceptible to attack by B. cinerea and had deficient callose deposition. Overexpression of either OmBBD or AtBBD1 in atbbd1 plants complemented the susceptible phenotype of atbbd1 against B. cinerea as well as the deficiency of callose deposition. We suggest that OmBBD and AtBBD1 have a novel regulatory role in ABA-mediated callose deposition.
20018701	Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Planthoppers are highly destructive pests in crop production worldwide. Brown planthopper (BPH) causes the most serious damage of the rice crop globally among all rice pests. Growing resistant varieties is the most effective and environment-friendly strategy for protecting the crop from BPH. More than 19 BPH-resistance genes have been reported and used to various extents in rice breeding and production. In this study, we cloned Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to BPH at seedling and maturity stages of the rice plant, using a map-base cloning approach. We show that Bph14 encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein. Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response. Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles, the site of BPH feeding. Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of rice defense against insects and facilitates the development of resistant varieties to control this devastating insect.
20021558	Drought-stimulated activity of plasma membrane nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and its catalytic properties in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	The activity of plasma membrane (PM) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and its catalytic properties in rice was investigated under drought stress conditions. Drought stress led to decreased leaf relative water content (RWC) and, as a result of drought-induced oxidative stress, the activities of antioxidant enzymes increased significantly. More interestingly, the intensity of applied water stress was correlated with increased production of H2O2 and O2 (-) and elevated activity of PM NADPH oxidase, a key enzyme of reactive oxygen species generation in plants. Histochemical analyses also revealed increased H2O2 and O2 (-) production in drought-stressed leaves. Application of diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of PM NADPH oxidase, did not alleviate drought-induced production of H2O2 and O2 (-). Catalysis experiments indicated that the rice PM NADPH oxidase was partially flavin-dependent. The pH and temperature optima for this enzyme were 9.8 and 40 degrees C, respectively. In addition, drought stress enhanced the activity under alkaline pH and high temperature conditions. These results suggest that a complex regulatory mechanism, associated with the NADPH oxidase-H2O2 system, is involved in the response of rice to drought stress.

20023405	Mechanisms of microRNA-mediated auxin signaling inferred from the rice mutant osaxr.	2010	Plant Signal Behav	Auxin, known as the central hormone, plays essential roles in plant growth and development. In auxin signaling pathways, the tiny RNA molecules, i.e., microRNAs (miRNAs), show their strong potential in modulating the auxin signal transduction. Recently, we isolated a novel auxin resistant rice mutant osaxr (Oryza sativa auxin resistant) that exhibited plethoric root defects. Microarray experiments were carried out to investigate the expression patterns of both the miRNAs and the protein-coding genes in osaxr. A number of miRNAs showed reduced auxin sensitivity in osaxr compared with the wild type (WT), which may contribute to the auxin-resistant phenotype of the mutant. Auxin response elements (AuxREs) were demonstrated to be more frequently present in the promoters of auxin-related miRNAs. In our previous report, a comparative analysis of miRNA and protein-coding gene expression datasets uncovered a number of reciprocally expressed miRNA-target pairs. A feedback circuit between miRNA and auxin response factor (ARF) was then proposed. Here, we will discuss in-depth some points raised in the previous report, in particular, the organ-specific expression patterns of miR164, the feedback regulatory model between miR167 and certain ARFs, and the potential signal interactions between auxin and nutrition or stress that are mediated by miRNAs in rice roots.
20028842	Orthologs of the class A4 heat shock transcription factor HsfA4a confer cadmium tolerance in wheat and rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread soil pollutant; thus, the underlying molecular controls of plant Cd tolerance are of substantial interest. A screen for wheat (Triticum aestivum) genes that confer Cd tolerance to a Cd hypersensitive yeast strain identified Heat shock transcription factor A4a (HsfA4a). Ta HsfA4a is most similar to the class A4 Hsfs from monocots. The most closely related rice (Oryza sativa) homolog, Os HsfA4a, conferred Cd tolerance in yeast, as did Ta HsfA4a, but the second most closely related rice homolog, Os HsfA4d, did not. Cd tolerance was enhanced in rice plants expressing Ta HsfA4a and decreased in rice plants with knocked-down expression of Os HsfA4a. An analysis of the functional domain using chimeric proteins constructed from Ta HsfA4a and Os HsfA4d revealed that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of HsfA4a is critical for Cd tolerance, and within the DBD, Ala-31 and Leu-42 are important for Cd tolerance. Moreover, Ta HsfA4a-mediated Cd resistance in yeast requires metallothionein (MT). In the roots of wheat and rice, Cd stress caused increases in HsfA4a expression, together the MT genes. Our findings thus suggest that HsfA4a of wheat and rice confers Cd tolerance by upregulating MT gene expression in planta.
20032208	Characterization of receptor proteins using affinity cross-linking with biotinylated ligands.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	The plant genome encodes a wide range of receptor-like proteins but the function of most of these proteins is unknown. We propose the use of affinity cross-linking of biotinylated ligands for a ligand-based survey of the corresponding receptor molecules. Biotinylated ligands not only enable the analysis of receptor-ligand interactions without the use of radioactive compounds but also the isolation and identification of receptor molecules by a simple affinity trapping method. We successfully applied this method for the characterization, isolation and identification of the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP). A biocytin hydrazide conjugate of N-acetylchitooctaose (GN8-Bio) was synthesized and used for the detection of CEBiP in the plasma or microsomal membrane preparations from rice and carrot cells. Binding characteristics of CEBiP analyzed by inhibition studies were in good agreement with the previous results obtained with the use of a radiolabeled ligand. The biotin-tagged CEBiP could be purified by avidin affinity chromatography and identified by LC-MALDI-MS/MS after tryptic digestion. We also used this method to detect OsFLS2, a rice receptor-like kinase for the perception of the peptide elicitor flg22, in membrane preparations from rice cells overexpressing OsFLS2. This work demonstrates the applicability of this method to the purification and identification of plant receptor proteins.
20035315	Development and application of gene-based markers for the major rice QTL Phosphorus uptake 1.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Marker-assisted breeding is a very useful tool for breeders but still lags behind its potential because information on the effect of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in different genetic backgrounds and ideal molecular markers are unavailable. Here, we report on some first steps toward the validation and application of the major rice QTL Phosphate uptake 1 (Pup1) that confers tolerance of phosphorus (P) deficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Based on the Pup1 genomic sequence of the tolerant donor variety Kasalath that recently became available, markers were designed that target (1) putative genes that are partially conserved in the Nipponbare reference genome and (2) Kasalath-specific genes that are located in a large insertion-deletion (INDEL) region that is absent in Nipponbare. Testing these markers in 159 diverse rice accessions confirmed their diagnostic value across genotypes and showed that Pup1 is present in more than 50% of rice accessions adapted to stress-prone environments, whereas it was detected in only about 10% of the analyzed irrigated/lowland varieties. Furthermore, the Pup1 locus was detected in more than 80% of the analyzed drought-tolerant rice breeding lines, suggesting that breeders are unknowingly selecting for Pup1. A hydroponics experiment revealed genotypic differences in the response to P deficiency between upland and irrigated varieties but confirmed that root elongation is independent of Pup1. Contrasting Pup1 near-isogenic lines (NILs) were subsequently grown in two different P-deficient soils and environments. Under the applied aerobic growth conditions, NILs with the Pup1 locus maintained significantly higher grain weight plant(-1) under P deprivation in comparison with intolerant sister lines without Pup1. Overall, the data provide evidence that Pup1 has the potential to improve yield in P-deficient and/or drought-prone environments and in diverse genetic backgrounds.
20037474	APC-targeted RAA1 degradation mediates the cell cycle and root development in plants.	2010	Plant Signal Behav	Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is necessary for a normal cell cycle. As compared with knowledge of the mechanism in animals and yeast, that in plants is less known. Here we summarize research into the regulatory mechanism of protein degradation in the cell cycle in plants. Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC), in the E3 family of enzymes, plays an important role in maintaining normal mitosis. APC activation and substrate specificity is determined by its activators, which can recognize the destruction box (D-box) in APC target proteins. Oryza sativa root architecture-associated 1 (OsRAA1) with GTP-binding activity was originally cloned from rice. Overexpression of of OsRAA1 inhibits the growth of primary roots in rice. Knockdown lines showed reduced height of seedlings because of abnormal cell division. OsRAA1 transgenic rice and fission yeast show a higher proportion of metaphase cells than that of controls, which suggests a blocked transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis. OsRAA1 co-localizes with spindle tubulin. It contains the D-box motif and interacts with OsRPT4 of the regulatory particle of 26S proteasome. OsRAA1 may be a cell cycle inhibitor that can be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its disruption is necessary for the transition from metaphase to anaphase during root growth in rice.
20039013	A single recessive gene controls cadmium translocation in the cadmium hyperaccumulating rice cultivar Cho-Ko-Koku.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is highly toxic to humans and can enter food chains from contaminated crop fields. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Cd accumulation in crop species will aid production of safe Cd-free food. Here, we identified a single recessive gene that allowed higher Cd translocation in rice, and also determined the chromosomal location of the gene. The Cd hyperaccumulator rice variety Cho-Ko-Koku showed 3.5-fold greater Cd translocation than the no-accumulating variety Akita 63 under hydroponics. Analysis of an F(2) population derived from these cultivars gave a 1:3 segregation ratio for high:low Cd translocation. This indicates that a single recessive gene controls the high Cd translocation phenotype. A QTL analysis identified a single QTL, qCdT7, located on chromosome 7. On a Cd-contaminated field, Cd accumulation in the F(2) population showed continuous variation with considerable transgression. Three QTLs for Cd accumulation were identified and the peak of the most effective QTL mapped to the same region as qCdT7. Our data indicate that Cd translocation mediated by the gene on qCdT7 plays an important role in Cd accumulation on contaminated soil.
20039179	Systematic analysis of GT factor family of rice reveals a novel subfamily involved in stress responses.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	GT factors constitute a plant-specific transcription factor family with a conserved trihelix DNA-binding domain. In this study, comprehensive sequence analysis suggested that 26 putative GT factors exist in rice. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinctive subfamilies (GTalpha, GTbeta, and GTgamma) of plant GT factors and each subfamily has a unique composition of predicted motifs. We characterized the OsGTgamma-1 gene, a typical member of the GTgamma subfamily in rice. This gene encodes a protein containing a conserved trihelix domain, and the OsGTgamma-1:GFP fusion protein was targeted to nuclei of rice cells. The transcript level of OsGTgamma-1 was strongly induced by salt stress and slightly induced by drought and cold stresses and abscisic acid treatment. Two other members of the GTgamma subfamily, OsGTgamma-2 and OsGTgamma-3, were also induced by most of the abiotic stresses. These results suggested that the genes of the GTgamma subfamily in rice may be involved in stress responses. A homozygous mutant osgtgamma-1 (with T-DNA inserted in the promoter region of OsGTgamma-1) showed more sensitive to salt stress than wild-type rice. Overexpression of OsGTgamma-1 in rice enhanced salt tolerance at the seedling stage. This evidence suggests that the OsGTgamma subfamily may participate in the regulation of stress tolerance in rice.
20039193	The bZIP transcription factor OsABF1 is an ABA responsive element binding factor that enhances abiotic stress signaling in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	A number of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors are known to function in stress signaling in plants but few have thus far been functionally characterized in rice. In our current study in rice, we have newly isolated and characterized the OsABF1 (Oryza sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1) gene that encodes a bZIP transcription factor. Its expression in seedling shoots and roots was found to be induced by various abiotic stress treatments such as anoxia, salinity, drought, oxidative stress, cold and abscisic acid (ABA). Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using GFP fusion vectors indicated that OsABF1 is a nuclear protein. In a yeast experiment, OsABF1 was shown to bind to ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and its N-terminal region was necessary to transactivate the downstream reporter gene. The homozygous T-DNA insertional mutants Osabf1-1 and Osabf1-2 were more sensitive in response to drought and salinity treatments than wild type plants. Furthermore, the upregulated expression of some ABA/stress-regulated genes in response to ABA treatment was suppressed in these Osabf1 mutants. Our current results thus suggest that OsABF1 is involved in abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling in rice.
20040584	Function and expression pattern of the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	The d1 mutant, which is deficient for the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (Galpha) gene of rice, shows dwarfism and sets small round seeds. To determine whether dwarfism in d1 is due to a reduction in cell number or to shortened cell length, the cell number of the leaf sheath, the internode, the root and the lemma was compared between Nipponbare, a wild-type rice and d1-5, a d1 allele derived from Nipponbare. Our results indicate that the cell number was reduced in all organs analyzed in d1-5. In addition, cell enlargement was found in roots and lemma of d1-5, although the organ length in d1-5 was shorter than that of wild-type rice. These results suggest that rice Galpha participates in cell proliferation in rice. Western blot analyses using anti-Galpha antibody and RT-PCR analyses indicate that Galpha is mostly expressed in the developing organs. Galpha promoter activity studies using the GUS reporter gene confirmed that the expression of Galpha was highest in developing organs. We conclude that rice Galpha participates in the regulation of cell number in a developmental stage-dependent manner.
20049613	Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	DREB2s (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2s) are transcription factors that interact with a cis-acting DRE (dehydration-responsive element)/CRT (C-repeat) sequence and activate the expression of downstream genes involved in water- and heat-shock stress responses and tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of all five DREB2-type genes in rice (OsDREB2 s: OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B, OsDREB2C, OsDREB2E and OsABI4) to determine which of them contribute to plant stress responses. We analysed the expression patterns of these genes under abiotic stress conditions, and we examined the subcellular localisation and transcriptional activation activity of their translational products in protoplasts. Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression. In addition, OsDREB2B showed nuclear specific localisation and the highest transactivation activity. OsDREB2B has functional and non-functional forms of its transcript similar to its orthologues in the grass family, and the functional form of its transcript was markedly increased during stress conditions. We analysed the splicing mechanism of OsDREB2B with transgenic rice that express the non-functional transcript and we found that the non-functional form is not a precursor of the functional form; thus, stress-inducible alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is an important mechanism for the regulation of OsDREB2B. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance. These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice.
20062964	Fine mapping of a gene for low-tiller number, Ltn, in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety Aikawa 1.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits related to grain production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A japonica-type variety, Aikawa 1, is known to have low-tiller number. The detailed location of a low-tillering gene, Ltn, which has been localized on chromosome 8 in Aikawa 1, was confirmed by molecular mapping. Using BC5F2 individuals derived from a cross between IR64 and Aikawa 1, the low-tillering gene was mapped to an interval defined by SSR markers ssr5816-3 and A4765. This was designated as Ltn because there was no reported gene for tillering in the region of chromosome 8. Through high-resolution linkage analysis, the candidate region of Ltn was located between DNA markers ssr6049-23 and ind6049-1 corresponding to 38.6 kbp on the Nipponbare genome sequence. These DNA markers, which were tightly linked to Ltn, are useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding studies.
20064202	Identification of a Rice stripe necrosis virus resistance locus and yield component QTLs using Oryza sativa x O. glaberrima introgression lines.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Developing new population types based on interspecific introgressions has been suggested by several authors to facilitate the discovery of novel allelic sources for traits of agronomic importance. Chromosome segment substitution lines from interspecific crosses represent a powerful and useful genetic resource for QTL detection and breeding programs.

RESULTS: We built a set of 64 chromosome segment substitution lines carrying contiguous chromosomal segments of African rice Oryza glaberrima MG12 (acc. IRGC103544) in the genetic background of Oryza sativa ssp. tropical japonica (cv. Caiapó). Well-distributed simple-sequence repeats markers were used to characterize the introgression events. Average size of the substituted chromosomal segments in the substitution lines was about 10 cM and covered the whole donor genome, except for small regions on chromosome 2 and 4. Proportions of recurrent and donor genome in the substitution lines were 87.59% and 7.64%, respectively. The remaining 4.78% corresponded to heterozygotes and missing data. Strong segregation distortion was found on chromosomes 3 and 6, indicating the presence of interspecific sterility genes. To illustrate the advantages and the power of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection using substitution lines, a QTL detection was performed for scored traits. Transgressive segregation was observed for several traits measured in the population. Fourteen QTLs for plant height, tiller number per plant, panicle length, sterility percentage, 1000-grain weight and grain yield were located on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. Furthermore, a highly significant QTL controlling resistance to the Rice stripe necrosis virus was located between SSR markers RM202-RM26406 (44.5-44.8 cM) on chromosome 11.

CONCLUSIONS: Development and phenotyping of CSSL libraries with entire genome coverage represents a useful strategy for QTL discovery. Mapping of the RSNV locus represents the first identification of a genetic factor underlying resistance to this virus. This population is a powerful breeding tool. It also helps in overcoming hybrid sterility barriers between species of rice.
20072620	Gene expression profiles deciphering rice phenotypic variation between Nipponbare (Japonica) and 93-11 (Indica) during oxidative stress.	2010	PLoS One	Rice is a very important food staple that feeds more than half the world's population. Two major Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) subspecies, japonica and indica, show significant phenotypic variation in their stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic variation are still largely unknown. A common link among different stresses is that they produce an oxidative burst and result in an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, methyl viologen (MV) as a ROS agent was applied to investigate the rice oxidative stress response. We observed that 93-11 (indica) seedlings exhibited leaf senescence with severe lesions under MV treatment compared to Nipponbare (japonica). Whole-genome microarray experiments were conducted, and 1,062 probe sets were identified with gene expression level polymorphisms between the two rice cultivars in addition to differential expression under MV treatment, which were assigned as Core Intersectional Probesets (CIPs). These CIPs were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and highlighted with enrichment GO terms related to toxin and oxidative stress responses as well as other responses. These GO term-enriched genes of the CIPs include glutathine S-transferases (GSTs), P450, plant defense genes, and secondary metabolism related genes such as chalcone synthase (CHS). Further insertion/deletion (InDel) and regulatory element analyses for these identified CIPs suggested that there may be some eQTL hotspots related to oxidative stress in the rice genome, such as GST genes encoded on chromosome 10. In addition, we identified a group of marker genes individuating the japonica and indica subspecies. In summary, we developed a new strategy combining biological experiments and data mining to study the possible molecular mechanism of phenotypic variation during oxidative stress between Nipponbare and 93-11. This study will aid in the analysis of the molecular basis of quantitative traits.
11448732	Isolation and analysis of expression mechanisms of a rice gene, EL5, which shows structural similarity to ATL family from Arabidopsis, in response to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor.	2001	Plant Sci	Two rice cDNAs, EL5 and RRF1, were isolated and characterized. EL5 was responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide, a biotic elicitor active in suspension-cultured rice cells. The structural specificity of the elicitor required for the expression of EL5 was consistent with other defense reactions observed in the experimental system, indicating that the elicitor signal to EL5 is transmitted through a single class of receptor-mediated recognition events. However, the intracellular signaling pathway to EL5 was distinct from those to other elicitor-responsive genes. Sequence analysis and alignment showed that a genomic sequence stored in rice genome databases in addition to EL5 and RRF1 belongs to the ATL family of RING-H2 finger motif proteins first isolated from Arabidopsis.
19010998	Experimental analysis of the rice mitochondrial proteome, its biogenesis, and heterogeneity.	2009	Plant Physiol	Mitochondria in rice (Oryza sativa) are vital in expanding our understanding of the cellular response to reoxygenation of tissues after anaerobiosis, the crossroads of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and the role of respiratory energy generation in cytoplasmic male sterility. We have combined density gradient and surface charge purification techniques with proteomics to provide an in-depth proteome of rice shoot mitochondria covering both soluble and integral membrane proteins. Quantitative comparisons of mitochondria purified by density gradients and after further surface charge purification have been used to ensure that the proteins identified copurify with mitochondria and to remove contaminants from the analysis. This rigorous approach to defining a subcellular proteome has yielded 322 nonredundant rice proteins and highlighted contaminants in previously reported rice mitochondrial proteomes. Comparative analysis with the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mitochondrial proteome reveals conservation of a broad range of known and unknown function proteins in plant mitochondria, with only approximately 20% not having a clear homolog in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome. As in Arabidopsis, only approximately 60% of the rice mitochondrial proteome is predictable using current organelle-targeting prediction tools. Use of the rice protein data set to explore rice transcript data provided insights into rice mitochondrial biogenesis during seed germination, leaf development, and heterogeneity in the expression of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial components in different rice tissues. Highlights include the identification of components involved in thiamine synthesis, evidence for coexpressed and unregulated expression of specific components of protein complexes, a selective anther-enhanced subclass of the decarboxylating segment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the differential expression of DNA and RNA replication components, and enhanced expression of specific metabolic components in photosynthetic tissues.
15950602	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 temporally regulates meristem identity in rice.	2005	Dev Biol	We report a recessive mutation of rice, aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1), which severely affects inflorescence architecture, floral organ identity, and leaf production rate. In the wild-type inflorescence, the main-axis meristem aborts after forming 10-12 primary branch primordia. However, in apo1, the main-axis meristem was converted to a spikelet meristem after producing a small number of branch primordia. In addition, the branch meristems in apo1 became spikelet meristems earlier than in wild type. Therefore, in the inflorescence, the apo1 mutation caused the precocious conversion of the meristem identity. In the apo1 flower, lodicules were increased at the expense of stamens, and carpels were formed indeterminately by the loss of meristem determinacy. Vegetative development is also affected in the apo1. Leaves were formed rapidly throughout the vegetative phase, indicating that APO1 is also involved in temporal regulation of leaf production. These phenotypes suggest that the APO1 plays an important role in the temporal regulation of both vegetative and reproductive development.
16452146	Substitution mapping of dth1.1, a flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with transgressive variation in rice, reveals multiple sub-QTL.	2006	Genetics	A quantitative trait locus (QTL), dth1.1, was associated with transgressive variation for days to heading in an advanced backcross population derived from the Oryza sativa variety Jefferson and an accession of the wild rice relative Oryza rufipogon. A series of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different O. rufipogon introgressions across the target region were constructed to dissect dth1.1 using substitution mapping. In contrast to the late-flowering O. rufipogon parent, O. rufipogon alleles in the substitution lines caused early flowering under both short- and long-day lengths and provided evidence for at least two distinct sub-QTL: dth1.1a and dth1.1b. Potential candidate genes underlying these sub-QTL include genes with sequence similarity to Arabidopsis GI, FT, SOC1, and EMF1, and Pharbitis nil PNZIP. Evidence from families with nontarget O. rufipogon introgressions in combination with dth1.1 alleles also detected an early flowering QTL on chromosome 4 and a late-flowering QTL on chromosome 6 and provided evidence for additional sub-QTL in the dth1.1 region. The availability of a series of near-isogenic lines with alleles introgressed from a wild relative of rice provides an opportunity to better understand the molecular basis of transgressive variation in a quantitative trait.
17166135	Reciprocal control of flowering time by OsSOC1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and by FLC in transgenic rice.	2003	Plant Biotechnol J	In a screen for MADS box genes which activate and/or repress flowering in rice, we identified a gene encoding a MADS domain protein (OsSOC1) related to the Arabidopsis gene AtSOC1. AtSOC1 and OsSOC1 show a 97% amino acid similarity in their MADS domain. The rice gene contains a large first intron of 27.6 kb compared to the 1 kb intron in Arabidopsis. OsSOC1 is located on top of the short arm of chromosome 3, tightly linked to the heading date locus, Hd9. OsSOC1 is expressed in vegetative tissues, and expression is elevated at the time of floral initiation, 40-50 days after sowing, and remains uniformly high thereafter, similar to the expression pattern of AtSOC1. The constitutive expression of OsSOC1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering, suggesting that the rice gene is a functional equivalent of AtSOC1. We were not able to identify FLC-like sequences in the rice genome; however, we show that ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis FLC delays flowering in rice, and the up-regulation of OsSOC1 at the onset of flowering initiation is delayed in the AtFLC transgenic lines. The reciprocal recognition and flowering time effects of genes introduced into either Arabidopsis or rice suggest that some components of the flowering pathways may be shared. This points to a potential application in the manipulation of flowering time in cereals using well characterized Arabidopsis genes.
17185171	Ultrastructure and gene mapping of the albino mutant al12 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Seedling albino mutation resistant to low temperature is an adaptability of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to cold. The mutant, a conditional expression controlled by development and temperature, differs from other albino mutants. The chlorophyll content of the mutant was measured using a portable chlorophyll meter, and the ultrastructure of the chloroplast was observed using a transmission electron microscope. Chlorophyll content was 1.2 SPAD, and the chloroplast did not develop, with only small vesicle-like structures. A segregation analysis of the reciprocal crosses between the albino mutation line with the rice line 9311 demonstrated that the albino trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was flanked by SSR markers RM5068 and RM3702 on the short arm of chromosome 8 with a distance of 0.5-1.1 cM and 4.9 cM, respectively. This gene was mapped within a 6 cM interval region and was tentatively referred to as al12.
20228626	SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice.	2010	Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci	Plant height is one of the most important traits in crop improvement. Therefore revealing the mechanism of plant elongation and controlling plant height in accordance with breeding object is important. In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, ssd1, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype. ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers. ssd1 also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant. Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function. A BLAST search revealed that SSD1-like genes exist in diverse plant species, including monocots and dicots, but not fern and moss. Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants.
20188068	Functional role of rice germin-like protein1 in regulation of plant height and disease resistance.	2010	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The functional role of rice (Oryza sativa) germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1) was elucidated through development of transgenic plants involving endogenous gene silencing in rice and heterologous gene expression in tobacco. Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues. The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant. Structural homology modeling predicted a superoxide dismutase (SOD) domain in OsGLP1 protein which upon over-expression in transgenic tobacco plant clearly documented SOD activity. Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant.
20062805	Validation of the ITS2 region as a novel DNA barcode for identifying medicinal plant species.	2010	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The plant working group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life recommended the two-locus combination of rbcL+matK as the plant barcode, yet the combination was shown to successfully discriminate among 907 samples from 550 species at the species level with a probability of 72%. The group admits that the two-locus barcode is far from perfect due to the low identification rate, and the search is not over.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we compared seven candidate DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, ycf5, ITS2, and ITS) from medicinal plant species. Our ranking criteria included PCR amplification efficiency, differential intra- and inter-specific divergences, and the DNA barcoding gap. Our data suggest that the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA represents the most suitable region for DNA barcoding applications. Furthermore, we tested the discrimination ability of ITS2 in more than 6600 plant samples belonging to 4800 species from 753 distinct genera and found that the rate of successful identification with the ITS2 was 92.7% at the species level.

CONCLUSIONS: The ITS2 region can be potentially used as a standard DNA barcode to identify medicinal plants and their closely related species. We also propose that ITS2 can serve as a novel universal barcode for the identification of a broader range of plant taxa.
19714315	Expression of BrD1, a plant defensin from Brassica rapa, confers resistance against brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) in transgenic rices.	2009	Mol Cells	Plant defensins are small (5-10 kDa) basic peptides thought to be an important component of the defense pathway against fungal and/or bacterial pathogens. To understand the role of plant defensins in protecting plants against the brown planthopper, a type of insect herbivore, we isolated the Brassica rapa Defensin 1 (BrD1) gene and introduced it into rice (Oryza sativa L.) to produce stable transgenic plants. The BrD1 protein is homologous to other plant defensins and contains both an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and a defensin domain, which are highly conserved in all plant defensins. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the defensin domain of various plant defensins, we established that BrD1 belongs to a distinct subgroup of plant defensins. Relative to the wild type, transgenic rices expressing BrD1 exhibit strong resistance to brown planthopper nymphs and female adults. These results suggest that BrD1 exhibits insecticidal activity, and might be useful for developing cereal crop plants resistant to sap-sucking insects, such as the brown planthopper.
19674331	Novel Phr1 mutations and the evolution of phenol reaction variation in US weedy rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	New Phytol	*Red rice, a major agricultural weed, is phenotypically diverse and possesses traits that are similar to both wild and cultivated rice. The genetic resources available for rice make it possible to examine the molecular basis and evolution of traits characterizing this weed. Here, we assess the phenol reaction - a classical trait for distinguishing among cultivated rice varieties - in red rice at the phenotypic and molecular levels. *We phenotyped more than 100 US weed samples for the phenol reaction and sequenced the underlying Phr1 locus in a subset of samples. Data were analyzed in combination with previously published Phr1 data for cultivated rice. *Most weed accessions (96.3%) are positive for the phenol reaction, and samples with a negative response carry loss-of-function alleles that are rare or heretofore undocumented. One such allele may have evolved through mutational convergence of a 1-bp frameshift insertion. Haplotype sharing between red rice and US cultivars suggests occasional crop-weed hybridization. *Our discovery of previously undocumented nonfunctional phr1 alleles suggests that there are likely to be other loss-of-function mutations segregating in Oryza sativa around the world. Red rice may provide a useful study system for understanding the adaptive significance of Phr1 variation in agricultural settings.
19564155	Enzymatic characterization and comparison of various poaceae UDP-GlcA 4-epimerase isoforms.	2009	J Biochem	UDP-alpha-D-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) is a key precursor for the synthesis of various bacterial and plant polysaccharides. UDP-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase (UGlcAE) catalyses the reversible conversion of UDP-alpha-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-GalA. UGlcAEs isolated from bacterial species have different biochemical properties when compared with the isoenzymes from the plant dicot species, Arabidopsis. However, little is known about the specificity of UGlcAE in Poaceae species. Therefore, we cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli several maize and rice UGlcAE genes, and compared their enzymatic properties with dicot homologs from Arabidopsis. Our data show that UGlcAE isoforms in different plant species have different enzymatic properties. For example, the Poaceae UGlcAE enzymes from rice and maize have significantly lower K(i) for UDP-xylose when compared with the Arabidopsis enzymes. The epimerases from different plant species are very specific and unlike their bacterial homolog in Klebsiella pneumoniae, can only use UDP-GlcA or UDP-GalA as their substrate. This study demonstrates that although members of the plant UGlcAE isoforms are highly conserved, the in vitro enzymatic activity of specific Poaceae isoform(s) may be regulated differently by specific nucleotide or nucleotide sugar.
19741004	Lineage-specific adaptive evolution of the centromeric protein CENH3 in diploid and allotetraploid Oryza species.	2009	Mol Biol Evol	Centromeres in eukaryotic species are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENH3. CENH3 plays a key role in recruiting other centromeric proteins; thus, it is the central component in kinetochore formation and centromere function. The CENH3 proteins in several plant and animal species were found to be under positive selection, which was hypothesized to respond to the rapid changing of the repetitive DNA sequences associated with the centromeres. Here, we report the expression and evolution of the CenH3 genes in two allotetraploid rice species as well as their representative diploid progenitor species. Both copies of the CenH3 genes were transcribed in the two allotetraploid species and showed a nonpreferential expression pattern. Contrasting positive and stabilizing selection of the CenH3 genes was associated with different diploid Oryza species. This lineage-specific adaptive evolution of CENH3 was maintained in the two allotetraploid species. Thus, we demonstrate that the allopolyploidization events did not alter the expression or evolutionary patterns of the CenH3 genes in the Oryza species.
20003305	A recent duplication revisited: phylogenetic analysis reveals an ancestral duplication highly-conserved throughout the Oryza genus and beyond.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The role of gene duplication in the structural and functional evolution of genomes has been well documented. Analysis of complete rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequences suggested an ancient whole genome duplication, common to all the grasses, some 50-70 million years ago and a more conserved segmental duplication between the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes 11 and 12, whose evolutionary history is controversial.

RESULTS: We have carried out a comparative analysis of this duplication within the wild species of the genus Oryza, using a phylogenetic approach to specify its origin and evolutionary dynamics. Paralogous pairs were isolated for nine genes selected throughout the region in all Oryza genome types, as well as in two outgroup species, Leersia perrieri and Potamophila parviflora. All Oryza species display the same global evolutionary dynamics but some lineage-specific features appear towards the proximal end of the duplicated region. The same level of conservation is observed between the redundant copies of the tetraploid species Oryza minuta. The presence of orthologous duplicated blocks in the genome of the more distantly-related species, Brachypodium distachyon, strongly suggests that this duplication between chromosomes 11 and 12 was formed as part of the whole genome duplication common to all Poaceae.

CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that recurrent but heterogeneous concerted evolution throughout the Oryza genus and in related species has led specifically to the extremely high sequence conservation occurring in this region of more than 2 Mbp.
15821864	DNA binding and pairing activity of OsDmc1, a recombinase from rice.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	A cloned cDNA corresponding to OsDMC1 from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli. The OsDmc1 protein was largely present in the inclusion bodies of the cell lysatE., which was solubilized by 8.0 M urea containing buffeR., purified to homogeneity by Ni-CAM agarose column chromatography, followed by renaturation to its native state through stepwise dialysis against reduced concentrations of urea. The purified protein cross-reacted with anti-yeast Dmc1 antibodies. The binding efficiency observed with circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was similar to that with circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The binding to either DNA showed no ATP dependencE., but required 5-10 mM Mg2+ in the presence of ATP. Even though the protein binding to dsDNA was as efficient as it was to ssDNA, the former induced no DNA dependent ATPasE., whereas the binding to ssDNA stimulated a significant level of DNA dependent ATPase activity. OsDmc1-ssDNA complex, with its ATPase proficiency, also mediated renaturation of homologous complementary strands as well as assimilation of single strands into homologous supercoiled duplexes leading to D-loop formation. The D-loop formation was lowered by excess of OsDmc1 protein. This D-loop formation activity was promoted by non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP and was not observed in absence of ATP or presence of ADP/ATP-gamma-S. These properties reflected the classical hallmarks of a recombinase and represented the first biochemical characterization of a plant Dmc1 protein.
19958136	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in a gene for translation initiation factor (eIF4G) of rice (Oryza sativa) associated with resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.	2010	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a serious constraint to rice production in South and Southeast Asia. RTD is caused by Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus. Rice cv. Utri Merah is resistant to RTSV. To identify the gene or genes involved in RTSV resistance, the association of genotypic and phenotypic variations for RTSV resistance was examined in backcross populations derived from Utri Merah and rice germplasm with known RTSV resistance. Genetic analysis revealed that resistance to RTSV in Utri Merah was controlled by a single recessive gene (tsv1) mapped within an approximately 200-kb region between 22.05 and 22.25 Mb of chromosome 7. A gene for putative translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G(tsv1)) was found in the tsv1 region. Comparison of eIF4G(tsv1) gene sequences among susceptible and resistant plants suggested the association of RTSV resistance with one of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites found in exon 9 of the gene. Examination of the SNP site in the eIF4G(tsv1) gene among various rice plants resistant and susceptible to RTSV corroborated the association of SNP or deletions in codons for Val(1060-1061) of the predicted eIF4G(tsv1) with RTSV resistance in rice.
16215849	Cloning and characterization of OsORC2, a new member of rice origin recognition complex.	2005	Biotechnol Lett	In eukaryotic cells, the origin recognition complex (ORC) governs the initiation site of DNA replication and formation of the prereplication complex. The isolation, characterization and tissue-specific expression of a putative ORC subunit 2 (OsORC2) in Oryza sativa is described here. A novel cDNA fragment encoding rice ORC2 was isolated by screening the subtractive library, which had a higher expression level in inflorescence meristem than in shoot apical meristem. The full-length cDNA of rice ORC2 was obtained by the method of rapid amplification of cDNA ends, which contained an 1140 bp open reading frame encoding a 379 amino acid polypeptide. Sequence alignment shows that there is a high homology between the deduced amino sequence of OsORC2 and maize ORC2 (85%). The tissue-specific expression pattern of OsORC2 reveals that it is abundant in roots, seedling and inflorescence meristem, while its expression level is much lower in mature leaves and shoot.
18726469	Amplification, analysis and chromosome mapping of novel homeobox-containing and homeobox-flanking sequences in rice.	1999	Sci China C Life Sci	Homeobox genes, widely distributed among animal and plant kingdoms, play an important role in developmental process. Several homeobox conserved fragments were amplified by PCR and the flanking regions were also obtained by an LM-PCR procedure. Sequencing and Southern analysis showed that they belong to a homeobox gene family of rice. Six homeobox-containing fragments were mapped on the molecular linkage map of rice. They were located on chromosomes 3, 4 and 7 respectively. It is noteworthy that there are 4 homeobox fragments located on rice chromosome 3 and the result is also consistent with the comparative genomics between rice and maize.
15960615	ARL1, a LOB-domain protein required for adventitious root formation in rice.	2005	Plant J	Adventitious roots constitute the bulk of the fibrous root system in cereals. Compared with the current understanding of shoot development, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of development of the adventitious roots of cereals is limited. We have isolated and characterized a novel gene controlling the initiation of adventitious root primordia in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The gene, designated Adventitious rootless1 (ARL1), encodes a protein with a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain. It is expressed in lateral and adventitious root primordia, tiller primordia, vascular tissues, scutellum, and young pedicels. ARL1 is a nuclear protein and can form homodimers. ARL1 is an auxin- and ethylene-responsive gene, and the expression pattern of ARL1 in roots parallels auxin distribution. Our findings suggest that ARL1 is an auxin-responsive factor involved in auxin-mediated cell dedifferentiation, and that it promotes the initial cell division in the pericycle cells adjacent to the peripheral vascular cylinder in the stem.
18758715	Structure, expression pattern and chromosomal localization of the rice Osgrp-2 gene.	2003	Sci China C Life Sci	Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) belong to a kind of important structural proteins of plant cell walls. The expression of GRP genes is regulated spatially and developmentally as well as by various environmental stresses, thus providing a good model for the study of plant gene expression. We obtained the genomic sequence of a new GRP gene (Osgrp- 2) from a rice genomic library. The transcription start site of Osgrp- 2 was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and a 2.4-kb promoter sequence was thus delimited. The spatial and developmental expression pattern as well as the wound-inducible character of Osgrp- 2 in rice plants was analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the gene was mapped onto rice chromosome 10 by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
18726210	Structural and functional analysis of a MADS box containing genomic DNA sequence cloned from rice.	1998	Sci China C Life Sci	A putative MADS box gene (RgMADS1) was cloned by screening a rice genomic library with a heterogeneous MADS box probe derived from Antirrhinum majus squamosa gene. Sequencing and Southern analysis showed that RgMADS1 contains a highly conserved MADS box sequence, - whereas the rice genome contains numbers of MADS box genes. A chimera gene of RgMADS1 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter was constructed and used to transform Arabidopsis. Some transformants exhibited abnormal phenotypes in their flowers, which were reflected in the floral structure, number and setting position. Therefore, RgMADS1 is likely a member of rice MADS box gene family and may be involved in the floral establishment and function control in the rice developmental process.
20220098	Molecular cloning of Sdr4, a regulator involved in seed dormancy and domestication of rice.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Seed dormancy provides a strategy for flowering plants to survive adverse natural conditions. It is also an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield, quality, and processing performance. We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars. Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes, suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program. Japonica cultivars have only the Nipponbare allele (Sdr4-n), which endows reduced dormancy, whereas both the Kasalath allele (Srd4-k) and Sdr4-n are widely distributed in the indica group, indicating prevalent introgression. Srd4-k also is found in the wild ancestor Oryza rufipogon, whereas Sdr4-n appears to have been produced through at least two mutation events from the closest O. rufipogon allele among the accessions examined. These results are discussed with respect to possible selection of the allele during the domestication process.
19834537	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice.	2009	PLoS Genet	CLAVATA signaling restricts stem cell identity in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis thaliana. In rice (Oryza sativa), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), closely related to CLV3, is involved as a signaling molecule in a similar pathway to negatively regulate stem cell proliferation in the floral meristem (FM). Here we show that the FON2 SPARE1 (FOS1) gene encoding a CLE protein functions along with FON2 in maintenance of the FM. In addition, FOS1 appears to be involved in maintenance of the SAM in the vegetative phase, because constitutive expression of FOS1 caused termination of the vegetative SAM. Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways. Initially, we identified FOS1 as a suppressor that originates from O. sativa indica and suppresses the fon2 mutation in O. sativa japonica. FOS1 function in japonica appears to be compromised by a functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) at the putative processing site of the signal peptide. Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus. Distribution of the FNP also suggests that this mutation may have occurred during the divergence of japonica from its wild ancestor. Stem cell maintenance may be regulated by at least three negative pathways in rice, and each pathway may contribute differently to this regulation depending on the type of the meristem. This situation contrasts with that in Arabidopsis, where CLV signaling is the major single pathway in all meristems.
19683587	Phylogeny and biogeography of the rice tribe (Oryzeae): evidence from combined analysis of 20 chloroplast fragments.	2010	Mol Phylogenet Evol	Based on sequences of 20 chloroplast fragments, we generated a fully resolved phylogeny of Oryzeae and estimated divergence times of its major lineages as well as explored the historical biogeography of the tribe. Our results (1) confirmed the monophyly of Oryzeae and two-subtribe subdivision; (2) indicated that Maltebrunia, Potamophila and Prosphytochloa were genetically distinct enough to deserve generic status but Maltebrunia and Prosphytochloa were sister groups in the subtribe Oryzinae while Potamophila was a member in the subtribe Zizaniinae; (3) suggested that the previously unresolved phylogeny of the subtribe Zizaniinae was most likely explained by insufficient data due to rapid radiation; (4) provided the first well-corroborated timescale for the origin and divergence of Oryzeae, with the crown node of Oryzeae and the deepest split of Oryza at approximately 24 and 15MYA, respectively; (5) developed a biogeographic history of the tribe and substantiated the important roles of long-distance dispersal in the origin and diversification of the tribe Oryzeae.
19781006	The LP2 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene promoter directs organ-specific, light-responsive expression in transgenic rice.	2009	Plant Biotechnol J	Biotechnologists seeking to limit gene expression to nonseed tissues of genetically engineered cereal crops have only a few choices of well characterized organ-specific promoters. We have isolated and characterized the promoter of the rice Leaf Panicle 2 gene (LP2, Os02g40240). The LP2 gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinase-like protein that is strongly expressed in leaves and other photosynthetic tissues. Transgenic rice plants containing an LP2 promoter-GUS::GFP bifunctional reporter gene displayed an organ-specific pattern of expression. This expression corresponded to transcript levels observed on RNA blots of various rice organs and microarray gene expression data. The strongest beta-glucuronidase activity was observed in histochemically stained mesophyll cells, but other green tissues and leaf cell types including epidermal cells also exhibited expression. Low or undetectable levels of LP2 transcript and LP2-mediated reporter gene expression were observed in roots, mature seeds, and reproductive tissues. The LP2 promoter is highly responsive to light and only weak expression was detected in etiolated rice seedlings. The specificity and strength of the LP2 promoter suggests that this promoter will be a useful control element for green tissue-specific expression in rice and potentially other plants. Organ-specific promoters like LP2 will enable precise, localized expression of transgenes in biotechnology-derived crops and limit the potential of unintended impacts on plant physiology and the environment.
20018713	Allelic diversities in rice starch biosynthesis lead to a diverse array of rice eating and cooking qualities.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	More than half of the world's population uses rice as a source of carbon intake every day. Improving grain quality is thus essential to rice consumers. The three main properties that determine rice eating and cooking quality--amylose content, gel consistency, and gelatinization temperature--correlate with one another, but the underlying mechanism of these properties remains unclear. Through an association analysis approach, we found that genes related to starch synthesis cooperate with each other to form a fine regulating network that controls the eating and cooking quality and defines the correlation among these three properties. Genetic transformation results verified the association findings and also suggested the possibility of developing elite cultivars through modification with selected major and/or minor starch synthesis-related genes.
19828030	Polyploid evolution in Oryza officinalis complex of the genus Oryza.	2009	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Polyploidization is a prominent process in plant evolution, whereas the mechanism and tempo-spatial process remained poorly understood. Oryza officinalis complex, a polyploid complex in the genus Oryza, could exemplify the issues not only for it covering a variety of ploidy levels, but also for the pantropical geographic pattern of its polyploids in Asia, Africa, Australia and Americas, in which a pivotal genome, the C-genome, witnessed all the polyploidization process.

RESULTS: Tracing the C-genome evolutionary history in Oryza officinalis complex, this study revealed the genomic relationships, polyploid forming and diverging times, and diploidization process, based on phylogeny, molecular-clock analyses and fluorescent in situ hybridization using genome-specific probes. Results showed that C-genome split with B-genome at ca. 4.8 Mya, followed by a series of speciation of C-genome diploids (ca. 1.8-0.9 Mya), which then partook in successive polyploidization events, forming CCDD tetraploids in ca. 0.9 Mya, and stepwise forming BBCC tetraploids between ca. 0.3-0.6 Mya. Inter-genomic translocations between B- and C-genomes were identified in BBCC tetraploid, O. punctata. Distinct FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) patterns among three CCDD species were visualized by C-genome-specific probes. B-genome was modified before forming the BBCC tetraploid, O. malampuzhaensis.

CONCLUSION: C-genome, shared by all polyploid species in the complex, had experienced different evolutionary history particularly after polyploidization, e.g., inter-genomic exchange in BBCC and genomic invasion in CCDD tetraploids. It diverged from B-genome at 4.8 Mya, then participated in the tetraploid formation spanning from 0.9 to 0.3 Mya, and spread into tropics of the disjunct continents by transcontinentally long-distance dispersal, instead of vicariance, as proposed by this study, given that the continental splitting was much earlier than the C-genome species radiation. We also find reliable evidence indicated that an extinct BB diploid species in Asia was presumptively the direct genomic donor of their sympatric tetraploids.
20154151	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice.	2010	Plant Cell	ZEP1, a transverse filament (TF) protein, is the rice (Oryza sativa) homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana ZYP1. In the Tos17-insertional zep1 mutants, homologous chromosomes align along the entire length of the chromosome, but the synaptonemal complex is not assembled in early prophase I. Crossovers are well formed, and 12 bivalents could be detected from diakinesis to metaphase I, which leads to equal chromosomal segregation in anaphase I. Moreover, the number of crossovers has a tendency to be increased compared with that in the wild type. These phenomena are different from the TF mutants identified so far in other organisms. Chiasma terminalization of the bivalent, which occurs frequently in the wild type, seldom occurred in zep1. Transmission electron micrographs and immunodetection using an antibody against ZEP1 showed that ZEP1 is the central element of the synaptonemal complex. Although PAIR2 and MER3 were loaded normally in zep1, their dissociation was delayed severely compared with the wild type. In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process.
20080642	Mitochondrial gene in the nuclear genome induces reproductive barrier in rice.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hybrid incompatibility in F(1) hybrids or later generations is often observed as sterility or inviability. This incompatibility acts as postzygotic reproductive isolation, which results in the irreversible divergence of species. Here, we show that the reciprocal loss of duplicated genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 causes hybrid pollen sterility in F(1) hybrids of the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relative O. glumaepatula. Functional analysis revealed that this gene is essential for the later stage of pollen development, and distribution analysis suggests that the gene duplication occurred before the divergence of the AA genome species. On the basis of these results, we discuss the possible contribution of the "founder effect" in establishing this reproductive barrier.
19689796	Evolutionary rate patterns of the Gibberellin pathway genes.	2009	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Analysis of molecular evolutionary patterns of different genes within metabolic pathways allows us to determine whether these genes are subject to equivalent evolutionary forces and how natural selection shapes the evolution of proteins in an interacting system. Although previous studies found that upstream genes in the pathway evolved more slowly than downstream genes, the correlation between evolutionary rate and position of the genes in metabolic pathways as well as its implications in molecular evolution are still less understood.

RESULTS: We sequenced and characterized 7 core structural genes of the gibberellin biosynthetic pathway from 8 representative species of the rice tribe (Oryzeae) to address alternative hypotheses regarding evolutionary rates and patterns of metabolic pathway genes. We have detected significant rate heterogeneity among 7 GA pathway genes for both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. Such rate variation is mostly likely attributed to differences of selection intensity rather than differential mutation pressures on the genes. Unlike previous argument that downstream genes in metabolic pathways would evolve more slowly than upstream genes, the downstream genes in the GA pathway did not exhibited the elevated substitution rate and instead, the genes that encode either the enzyme at the branch point (GA20ox) or enzymes catalyzing multiple steps (KO, KAO and GA3ox) in the pathway had the lowest evolutionary rates due to strong purifying selection. Our branch and codon models failed to detect signature of positive selection for any lineage and codon of the GA pathway genes.

CONCLUSION: This study suggests that significant heterogeneity of evolutionary rate of the GA pathway genes is mainly ascribed to differential constraint relaxation rather than the positive selection and supports the pathway flux theory that predicts that natural selection primarily targets enzymes that have the greatest control on fluxes.
19674325	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication.	2009	New Phytol	Molecular cloning of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for the reduction of rice grain shattering, a hallmark of cereal domestication, provided opportunities for in-depth investigation of domestication processes. Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp. indica and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, and the wild progenitors, Oryza nivara andOryza rufipogon. The nonshattering sh4 allele was fixed in all rice cultivars, with levels of sequence polymorphism significantly reduced in both indica and japonica cultivars relative to the wild progenitors. The sh4 phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that sh4 had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice. Selection on qSH1 was not detected in indica and remained unclear in japonica. Selection on sh4 could be strong enough to have driven its fixation in a population of cultivated rice within a period of c. 100 yr. The slow fixation of the nonshattering phenotype observed at the archeological sites might be a result of relatively weak selection on mutations other than sh4 in early rice cultivation. The fixation of sh4 could have been achieved later through strong selection for the optimal phenotype.
16317034	Identification of a mitochondrial ATP synthase small subunit gene (RMtATP6) expressed in response to salts and osmotic stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	J Exp Bot	Large areas of northern China have alkaline soil due to the accumulation of sodium carbonates (NaHCO3, Na2CO3). To understand better how plants can tolerate alkaline soil, a cDNA library was prepared from rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots grown in the presence of NaHCO3 stress. A cDNA clone isolated from this library was identified by a homology search as a mitochondrial ATP synthase 6 kDa subunit gene (RMtATP6; GenBank accession nos AB055076, BAB21526). In transformed yeast and tobacco protoplasts, the RMtATP6 protein was localized in mitochondria using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. Analysis of RMtATP6 mRNA levels suggested that the expression of this gene was induced by stress from sodium carbonates and other sodium salts. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing the RMtATP6 gene had greater tolerance to salt stress at the seedling stage than untransformed tobacco. Among the other genes for F1F0-ATPase of rice, some were found to be up-regulated by some environmental stresses and some were not. These data suggest that the RMtATP6 protein acts as a subunit of ATP synthase, and is expressed in response to stress from several salts, with the other genes coding for the subunits of the same ATP-synthase.
20360021	A rapid, direct observation method to isolate mutants with defects in starch grain morphology in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Starch forms transparent grains, referred to as starch grains (SGs), in amyloplasts. Despite the simple glucose polymer composition of starch, SGs exhibit different morphologies depending on plant species, especially in the endosperm of the Poaceae family. This study reports a novel method for preparing thin sections of endosperm without chemical fixation or resin embedding that allowed us to visualize subcellular SGs clearly. Using this method, we observed the SG morphologies of >5,000 mutagenized rice seeds and were able to isolate mutants in which SGs were morphologically altered. In five mutants, named ssg (substandard starch grain), increased numbers of small SGs (ssg1-ssg3), enlarged SGs (ssg4) and abnormal interior structures of SGs (ssg5) were observed. Amylopectin chain length distribution analysis and identification of the mutated gene suggested a possible allelic relationship between ssg1, ssg2, ssg3 and the previously isolated amylose-extender (ae) mutants, while ssg4 and ssg5 seemed to be novel mutants. Compared with conventional observation methods, the methods developed here are more effective for obtaining fine images of subcellular SGs and are suitable for the observation of a large number of samples.
20305120	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development.	2010	Plant Cell	In flowering plants, sink tissues rely on transport of carbohydrates from photosynthetic tissues (sources) for nutrition and energy. However, how sugar partitioning in plants is regulated at the molecular level during development remains unknown. We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs. In particular, the csa mutant had reduced levels of carbohydrates in later anthers and was male sterile. The csa mutant had reduced accumulation of (14)C-labeled sugars in anther sink tissue. CSA was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode an R2R3 MYB transcription factor that was expressed preferentially in the anther tapetal cells and in the sugar-transporting vascular tissues. In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers. Furthermore, CSA was found to be associated in vivo and in vitro with the promoter of MST8. Our findings suggest that CSA is a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning in rice during male reproductive development. This study also establishes a molecular model system for further elucidation of the genetic control of carbon partitioning in plants.
9291960	Conservation of rice genetic resources: the role of the International Rice Genebank at IRRI.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Rice genetic resources, comprising landrace varieties, modern and obsolete varieties, genetic stocks, breeding lines, and the wild rices, are the basis of world food security. The International Rice Genebank at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines conserves the largest and most diverse collection of rice germplasm. The facilities of the genebank ensure the long-term preservation of this important diversity. In field research, factors that affect long-term viability of rice seeds have been identified, leading to the introduction of modified practices for germplasm multiplication and regeneration. The value of conserved germplasm can be assessed in terms of useful traits for rice breeding and the economic impact that germplasm utilization has on rice production and productivity. The application of molecular markers is changing perspectives on germplasm management. International policies affecting access to and use of rice germplasm are discussed.
16258238	Identification of a rice gene (Bph 1) conferring resistance to brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) using STS markers.	2005	Mol Cells	This study was carried out to identify a high-resolution marker for a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper (BPH) biotype 1, using japonica type resistant lines. Bulked segregant analyses were conducted using 520 RAPD primers to identify RAPD fragments linked to the BPH resistance gene. Eleven RAPDs were shown to be polymorphic amplicons between resistant and susceptible progeny. One of these primers, OPE 18, which amplified a 923 bp band tightly linked to resistance, was converted into a sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker. The STS marker, BpE18-3, was easily detectable as a dominant band with tight linkage (3.9cM) to Bph1. It promises to be useful as a marker for assisted selection of resistant progeny in backcross breeding programs to introgress the resistance gene into elite japonica cultivars.
19490167	The distribution and identification of brown planthopper resistance genes in rice.	2009	Hereditas	A collection of 515 rice landraces originating from Vietnam and China were screened for the reaction to brown planthopper (BPH) infestation. Most of the resistant landraces were indica types from Vietnam and the Guangxi province in China. An F(2) mapping population was created from the cross between a BPH resistant Vietnamese landrace Yagyaw and the susceptible cultivar Cpslo17. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to BPH resistance were mapped on chromosomes 2, 4, 7 and 9, respectively. The individual QTL accounted 5.64% to 12.77% of the phenotypic variance, and three resistant alleles were harbored in the resistant landrace Yagyaw. Two QTL located on chromosomes 2 and 4 were identified with significant additive effects and are useful in breeding new rice inbred lines. One resistant allele was harbored by the susceptible parent Cpslo17. This gene is important in selecting rice inbred lines with stronger resistances to BPH.
12580278	Candidate defense genes from rice, barley, and maize and their association with qualitative and quantitative resistance in rice.	2003	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Candidate genes involved in both recognition (resistance gene analogs [RGAs]) and general plant defense (putative defense response [DR]) were used as molecular markers to test for association with resistance in rice to blast, bacterial blight (BB), sheath blight, and brown plant-hopper (BPH). The 118 marker loci were either polymerase chain reaction-based RGA markers or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers that included RGAs or putative DR genes from rice, barley, and maize. The markers were placed on an existing RFLP map generated from a mapping population of 116 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between an improved indica rice cultivar, IR64, and a traditional japonica cultivar, Azucena. Most of the RGAs and DR genes detected a single locus with variable copy number and mapped on different chromosomes. Clusters of RGAs were observed, most notably on chromosome 11 where many known blast and BB resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for blast, BB, sheath blight, and BPH were located. Major resistance genes and QTL for blast and BB resistance located on different chromosomes were associated with several candidate genes. Six putative QTL for BB were located on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 and nine QTL for BPH resistance were located to chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 11, and 12. The alleles of QTL for BPH resistance were mostly from IR64 and each explained between 11.3 and 20.6% of the phenotypic variance. The alleles for BB resistance were only from the Azucena parent and each explained at least 8.4% of the variation. Several candidate RGA and DR gene markers were associated with QTL from the pathogens and pest. Several RGAs were mapped to BB QTL. Dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase co-localized with two BPH QTL associated with plant response to feeding and also to blast QTL. Blast QTL also were associated with aldose reductase, oxalate oxidase, JAMyb (a jasmonic acid-induced Myb transcription factor), and peroxidase markers. The frame map provides reference points to select candidate genes for cosegregation analysis using other mapping populations, isogenic lines, and mutants.
9753773	Expression of snowdrop lectin (GNA) in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to rice brown planthopper.	1998	Plant J	Snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) has been shown previously to be toxic towards rice brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens; BPH) when administered in artificial diet. BPH feeds by phloem abstraction, and causes 'hopper burn', as well as being an important virus vector. To evaluate the potential of the gna gene to confer resistance towards BPH, transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were produced, containing the gna gene in constructs where its expression was driven by a phloem-specific promoter (from the rice sucrose synthase RSs1 gene) and by a constitutive promoter (from the maize ubiquitin ubi1 gene). PCR and Southern analyses on DNA from these plants confirmed their transgenic status, and that the transgenes were transmitted to progeny after self-fertilization. Western blot analyses revealed expression of GNA at levels of up to 2.0% of total protein in some of the transgenic plants. GNA expression driven by the RSs1 promoter was tissue-specific, as shown by immunohistochemical localization of the protein in the non-lignified vascular tissue of transgenic plants. Insect bioassays and feeding studies showed that GNA expressed in the transgenic rice plants decreased survival and overall fecundity (production of offspring) of the insects, retarded insect development, and had a deterrent effect on BPH feeding. gna is the first transgene to exhibit insecticidal activity towards sap-sucking insects in an important cereal crop plant.
15032948	Marker-assisted pyramiding of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) resistance genes Bph1 and Bph2 on rice chromosome 12.	2004	Hereditas	Brown planthopper (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a significant insect pest of rice (Oryza sativa L.). We constructed a gene-pyramided japonica line, in which two BPH resistance genes Bph1 and Bph2 on the long arm of chromosome 12 independently derived from two indica resistance lines were combined through the recombinant selection. The gene-pyramiding was achieved based on the previously constructed high-resolution linkage maps of the two genes. Two co-dominant and four dominant PCR-based markers flanking the loci were used to select for a homozygous recombinant line in a segregating population that was derived from a cross between the parental homozygous single-gene introgression lines. BPH bioassay showed that the resistance level of the pyramided line was equivalent to that of the Bph1-single introgression line, which showed a higher level of resistance than the Bph2-single introgression line. The pyramid line should provide a useful experimental means for studying the fine structure of the chromosomal region covering these two major BPH resistance genes.
11985267	[Detection and analysis of QTL for resistance to the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), in rice (Oryza sativa L.), using backcross inbred lines].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	A mapping population of 98 BC1F9 lines (backcross inbred lines: BILs), derived from a backcross of Nipponbare (japonica)/Kasalath (indica)//Nipponbare by the single-seed descent methods, was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål). Seedbox Screening Technique (SST) was applied to evaluate the reactions of two parents and 98 BILs to BPH at the seedling stage, and the entries were graded on ratio of dead seedlings. A total of three QTL controlling BPH resistance were detected on chromosomes 2, 10 and 12, respectively. Individual QTL accounted for between 10.4% and 16.6% of the phenotypic variance, and the resistance of all the three QTL came from Kasalath, the moderate resistance parent. These QTL should be useful in breeding of varieties resistant to BPH in marker-assisted selection (MAS) program.
17567441	Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with resistance to brown planthopper in the indica rice cultivar Col.5 Thailand.	2007	Hereditas	The brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most serious insect pests of rice throughout Asia. In this study, we constructed a linkage map to determine the locus for BPH resistance gene, using an F(2) population from a cross between a resistant indica cultivar, 'Col.5 Thailand', and a susceptible cultivar '02428'. Insect resistance was evaluated using 147 F(3) families and the genotype of each F(2) plant was inferred from the phenotype of corresponding F(3) families. Two QTLs was detected on chromosome 2 (explains 29.4% phenotypic variation) and 6 (46.2% variation explained) associated with resistance to BPH in the mapping population. Comparison of the chromosomal locations and reactions to BPH biotypes indicated that the gene on chromosome 6 is different from at least 18 of the 19 previously identified BPH resistance genes. These two genes have large effects on BPH resistance and may be a useful BPH resistance resource for rice breeding programs.
14666132	Two whitebacked planthopper resistance genes in rice share the same loci with those for brown planthopper resistance.	2004	Heredity (Edinb)	The whitebacked planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera, and brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens Stål are important sucking insects of rice (Oryza sativa L.) crops throughout the world. Rice 'B5', which has derived its resistance genes from the wild rice O. officinalis Wall ex Watt, is a line that is highly resistant to both WBPH and BPH. Previously, two resistance genes against BPH, Qbp1, and Qbp2 in 'B5' had been mapped onto chromosome 3 and chromosome 4, respectively. In this study, we employed a mapping population composed of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), produced from a cross between 'B5' and susceptible variety 'Minghui63', to locate the WBPH and BPH resistance genes. A RFLP survey of the bulked extremes from the RIL population identified two genomic regions, one on chromosome 3 and the other on chromosome 4, likely containing the resistance genes to planthoppers. QTL analysis of the RILs further confirmed that two WBPH resistance genes were mapped on the same loci as Qbp1 and Qbp2, using a linkage map with 242 molecular markers distributed on 12 rice chromosomes. Of the two WBPH resistance genes, one designated Wbph7(t) was located within a 1.1-cM region between R1925 and G1318 on chromosome 3, the other designated Wbph8(t) was within a 0.3-cM region flanked by R288 and S11182 on chromosome 4. A two-way analysis of variance showed that two loci acted independently with each other in determining WBPH resistance. The results have significant implications in studying the interactions between sucking insects and plants and in breeding programs of resistance to rice planthoppers.
18052889	Responses of two contrasting genotypes of rice to brown planthopper.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and brown planthoppers (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) provide an ideal system for studying molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between plants and phloem-feeding insects. The phenotypic responses and changes in transcript profiles of seedlings representing two rice cultivars differing in resistance to the BPH were analyzed. In the BPH-compatible (susceptible) cv. MH63, BPH feeding reduced three examined plant growth parameters (leaf area expansion, height increases, and dry weight increases) and photosynthetic rates of the leaves. In the BPH-incompatible (resistant) cv. B5, BPH feeding caused slight reductions in protein and sucrose contents, but the plants maintained their photosynthetic activity and grew normally. A cDNA microarray containing 1,920 suppression subtractive hybridization clones was used to explore the transcript profiles differences in the two cultivars under control and BPH-feeding conditions. In total, 160 unique genes were detected as being significantly affected by BPH feeding in rice plants, covering a wide range of functional categories, and there were 38 genes that showed the similar transcript pattern in both genotypes. The physiological responses and transcript profiles of plants represented in both genotypes suggested that multiple pathways might be involved in reprogramming of BPH-infested rice plants. The differences in transcript levels between the compatible and incompatible interactions revealed in this study were not only the reaction of resistance and susceptibility but also reflections of different damage rates and genotypic backgrounds of the rice cultivars.
12184487	Molecular mapping and genetic analysis of a rice brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) resistance gene.	2002	Hereditas	The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, is a serious insect pest of rice (Oryza saliva L.). We have determined the chromosomal location of a BPH resistance gene in rice using SSR and RFLP techniques. A rice line 'B14', derived from the wild rice Oryza latifolia, showed high resistance to BPH. For tagging the resistance gene in 'B14X', an F2 population and a recombinant inbred (RI) population from a cross between Taichung Native 1 and 'B14' were developed and evaluated for BPH resistance. The results showed that a single dominant gene controlled the resistance of 'B14' to BPH. Bulked segregant SSR analysis was employed for identification of DNA markers linked to the resistance gene. From the survey of 302 SSR primer pairs, three SSR (RM335, RM261, RM185) markers linked to the resistance gene were identified. The closest SSR marker RM261 was linked to the resistance gene at a distance of 1.8 cM. Regions surrounding the resistance gene and the SSR markers were examined with additional RFLP markers on chromosome 4 to define the location of the resistance gene. Linkage of RFLP markers C820, R288, C946 with the resistance gene further confirmed its location on the short arm of chromosome 4. Closely linked DNA markers will facilitate selection for resistant lines in breeding programs and provide the basis for map-based cloning of this resistance gene.
20487383	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice.	2010	Plant J	Leaf veins have a complex network pattern. Formation of this vein pattern has been widely studied as a model of tissue pattern formation in plants. To understand the molecular mechanism governing the vascular patterning process, we isolated the rice mutant, commissural vein excessive1 (coe1). The coe1 mutants had short commissural vein (CV) intervals and produced clustered CVs. Application of 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid and brefeldin A decreased CV intervals, and application of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid increased CV intervals in wild-type rice; however, coe1 mutants were insensitive to these chemicals. COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane. Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation. Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals. These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals.
11470159	Identification of Dof proteins with implication in the gibberellin-regulated expression of a peptidase gene following the germination of rice grains.	2001	Biochim Biophys Acta	Type III carboxypeptidase (CPD3) is one of the hydrolytic enzymes whose expression is up-regulated by gibberellins (GA) in the aleurones of germinated cereal grains. A number of pyrimidine boxes and a sequence resembling the gibberellic acid response element (GARE) are observed in the region upstream of the transcription initiation site of the CPD3 gene, showing a characteristic of cereal GA-responsive genes. Transient gene expression assays in germinated rice aleurone demonstrated that the CPD3 promoter was able to confer hormonally responses on the expression of the reporter gene. By southwestern screening, several cDNAs encoding the Dof class proteins were isolated from a rice aleurone library. Each mRNA accumulation for five novel members of Dof proteins (OsDof1--5) occurs with a different time course and in a tissue-specific manner following the germination of grains. Of these, the expression of the OsDof3 gene is abundant in aleurones where it precedes that of the CPD3 gene, implying that this is an early response gene of GA. The OsDof3 protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, selectively bound AAAG motifs of the pyrimidine boxes through the DNA-binding activity of its Dof domain. Co-expression experiments in aleurones suggested that the OsDof3 protein should play a regulatory role in the expression of the CPD3 gene under the control of GA.
12877745	Genome-wide comparative phylogenetic analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis Dof gene families.	2003	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Dof proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors that contain a particular class of zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. Members of this family have been found to play diverse roles in gene regulation of processes restricted to the plants. The completed genome sequences of rice and Arabidopsis constitute a valuable resource for comparative genomic analyses, since they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms. In this framework, the identification of phylogenetic relationships among Dof proteins in these species is a fundamental step to unravel functionality of new and yet uncharacterised genes belonging to this group.

RESULTS: We identified 30 different Dof genes in the rice Oryza sativa genome and performed a phylogenetic analysis of a complete collection of the 36-reported Arabidopsis thaliana and the rice Dof transcription factors identified herein. This analysis led to a classification into four major clusters of orthologous genes and showed gene loss and duplication events in Arabidopsis and rice, that occurred before and after the last common ancestor of the two species.

CONCLUSIONS: According to our analysis, the Dof gene family in angiosperms is organized in four major clusters of orthologous genes or subfamilies. The proposed clusters of orthology and their further analysis suggest the existence of monocot specific genes and invite to explore their functionality in relation to the distinct physiological characteristics of these evolutionary groups.
20057139	Purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant rice UDP-arabinopyranose mutase generated in insect cells.	2010	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Plants utilize UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in the biosynthesis of Araf-containing complex carbohydrates. UDP-Araf is synthesized from UDP-arabinopyranose by UDP-arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs). Here we describe the heterologous expression of rice (Oryza sativa) UAM genes in insect cells and report some of their enzymatic properties. Recombinant UAMs might serve as useful tools for the biosynthesis of UDP-Araf and might be better than chemical synthesis.
17182701	A plant mutase that interconverts UDP-arabinofuranose and UDP-arabinopyranose.	2007	Glycobiology	Plant cell walls constitute the bulk of the earth renewable source of energy and are a component in the diet of humans and herbivores. l-Arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues are a quantifiably important constituent of these walls. Plants use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-l-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) to donate Araf residues in the biosynthesis of Araf-containing polysaccharides, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. However, little is known about the formation of UDP-Araf. We now describe the purification and partial characterization of a rice UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM) that catalyzes the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap). The reaction is reversible and at thermodynamic equilibrium the pyranose form is favored over the furanose form (90 : 10). Three related proteins that are encoded by rice gene loci Os03g40270, Os04g56520, and Os07g41360 were identified from partial amino acid sequences of UAM. These proteins have >80% sequence identity with polypeptides that are reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-sugars. The rice mutase and two functionally active recombinant mutases were shown to be reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-Glc. The cofactor, flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD), is required for the catalytic activity of UDP-galactose mutases of prokaryotes, fungi, and protozoa. The plant mutases, which do not require a cofactor, must therefore have a different catalytic mechanism. Putative UAM-encoding genes are present in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the gymnosperm Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and in numerous dicots and monocots, indicating that UAMs are widespread in green plants.
16537113	Ancient signals: comparative genomics of plant MAPK and MAPKK gene families.	2006	Trends Plant Sci	MAPK signal transduction modules play crucial roles in regulating many biological processes in plants, and their components are encoded by highly conserved genes. The recent availability of genome sequences for rice and poplar now makes it possible to examine how well the previously described Arabidopsis MAPK and MAPKK gene family structures represent the broader evolutionary situation in plants, and analysis of gene expression data for MPK and MKK genes in all three species allows further refinement of those families, based on functionality. The Arabidopsis MAPK nomenclature appears sufficiently robust to allow it to be usefully extended to other well-characterized plant systems.
19819927	Physiological and molecular changes in Oryza meridionalis Ng., a heat-tolerant species of wild rice.	2010	J Exp Bot	Oryza meridionalis Ng. is a wild relative of Oryza sativa L. found throughout northern Australia where temperatures regularly exceed 35 degrees C in the monsoon growing season. Heat tolerance in O. meridionalis was established by comparing leaf elongation and photosynthetic rates at 45 degrees C with plants maintained at 27 degrees C. By comparison with O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Amaroo, O. meridionalis was heat tolerant. Elongation rates of the third leaf of O. meridionalis declined by 47% over 24 h at 45 degrees C compared with a 91% decrease for O. sativa. Net photosynthesis was significantly higher in O. sativa at 27 degrees C whereas the two species had the same assimilation rates at 45 degrees C. The leaf proteome and expression levels of individual heat-responsive genes provided insight into the heat response of O. meridionalis. After 24 h of heat exposure, many enzymes involved in the Calvin Cycle were more abundant, while mRNA of their genes generally decreased. Ferredoxin-NADP(H) oxidoreductase, a key enzyme in photosynthetic electron transport had both reduced abundance and gene expression, suggesting light reactions were highly susceptible to heat stress. Rubisco activase was strongly up-regulated after 24 h of heat, with the large isoform having the largest relative increase in protein abundance and a significant increase in gene expression. The protective proteins Cpn60, Hsp90, and Hsp70 all increased in both protein abundance and gene expression. A thiamine biosynthesis protein (THI1), previously shown to act protectively against stress, increased in abundance during heat, even as thiamine levels fell in O. meridionalis.
19858118	Physiological and proteomic approaches to address heat tolerance during anthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	J Exp Bot	Episodes of high temperature at anthesis, which in rice is the most sensitive stage to temperature, are expected to occur more frequently in future climates. The morphology of the reproductive organs and pollen number, and changes in anther protein expression, were studied in response to high temperature at anthesis in three rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes. Plants were exposed to 6 h of high (38 degrees C) and control (29 degrees C) temperature at anthesis and spikelets collected for morphological and proteomic analysis. Moroberekan was the most heat-sensitive genotype (18% spikelet fertility at 38 degrees C), while IR64 (48%) and N22 (71%) were moderately and highly heat tolerant, respectively. There were significant differences among the genotypes in anther length and width, apical and basal pore lengths, apical pore area, and stigma and pistil length. Temperature also affected some of these traits, increasing anther pore size and reducing stigma length. Nonetheless, variation in the number of pollen on the stigma could not be related to measured morphological traits. Variation in spikelet fertility was highly correlated (r=0.97, n=6) with the proportion of spikelets with > or = 20 germinated pollen grains on the stigma. A 2D-gel electrophoresis showed 46 protein spots changing in abundance, of which 13 differentially expressed protein spots were analysed by MS/MALDI-TOF. A cold and a heat shock protein were found significantly up-regulated in N22, and this may have contributed to the greater heat tolerance of N22. The role of differentially expressed proteins and morphology during anther dehiscence and pollination in shaping heat tolerance and susceptibility is discussed.
19921249	The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice.	2010	Planta	The cell cycle is an important process during seed development in plants and its progression is driven by a number of core regulators such as the cyclins. Currently, however, little is known regarding the role of the cyclins in embryo and endosperm development in cereals. In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo. It was further found that a delayed and abnormal cellularization occurred in the endosperm in these knockdown seeds which eventually became abortive. Moreover, the observed development of the enlarged embryo was also morphologically abnormal and found to be caused by an enlarged cell size rather than an increased cell number. Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling further indicated that a large number of genes are responsible for the phenotype of the enlarged embryo. The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm. Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice.
19933315	The syncytium-specific expression of the Orysa;KRP3 CDK inhibitor: implication of its involvement in the cell cycle control in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) syncytial endosperm.	2010	J Exp Bot	During rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed development, the primary endosperm nucleus undergoes a series of divisions without cytokinesis, producing a multinucleate cell, known as a syncytium. After several rounds of rapid nuclear proliferation, the syncytium ceases to undergo mitosis; thereafter, the syncytium is partitioned into individual cells by a specific type of cytokinesis called cellularization. The transition between syncytium and cellularization is important in determining the final seed size and is a model for studying the cell cycle and cytokinesis. The involvement of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) in cell cycle control was investigated here during the transition between syncytium and cellularization. It was found that one of the rice CKIs, Orysa;KRP3, is strongly expressed in the caryopsis at 2 d after flowering (DAF), and its expression is significantly reduced at 3 DAF. The other CKI transcripts did not show such a shift at 2 DAF. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Orysa;KRP3 is expressed in multinucleate syncytial endosperm at 2 DAF, but not in cellularized endosperm at 3 DAF. Two-hybrid assays showed that Orysa;KRP3 binds Orysa;CDKA;1, Orysa;CDKA;2, Orysa;CycA1;1, and Orysa;CycD2;2. By contrast, Orysa;CDKB2;1 and Orysa;CycB2;2 do not show binding to Orysa;KRP3. Orysa;KRP3 was able to rescue yeast premature cell division due to the dominant positive expression of mutant rice CDKA;1 indicating that Orysa;KRP3 inhibited rice CDK. These data suggest that Orysa;KRP3 is involved in cell cycle control of syncytial endosperm.
19939835	High-affinity sodium uptake in land plants.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	High-affinity Na(+) uptake in plants and its mediation by HKT transporters have been studied in very few species. This study expands the knowledge of high-affinity Na(+) uptake in land plants for both uptake characteristics and involvement of HKT transporters. In non-flowering plants, we analyzed the Na(+) content of wild mosses, carried out experiments on K(+) and Na(+) uptake in the micromolar range of concentrations with the moss Physcomitrella patens and the liverwort Riccia fluitans, studied a Deltahkt1 mutant of P. patens and identified the HKT genes of the lycopodiophyta (clubmoss) Selaginella moellendorffii. In flowering plants we studied Na(+) uptake in the micromolar range of concentrations in 16 crop plant species, identified the HKT transporters that could mediate high-affinity Na(+) uptake in several species of the Triticeae tribe, and described some characteristics of high-affinity Na(+) uptake in other species. Our results suggest that high-affinity Na(+) uptake occurs in most land plants. In very few of them, rice and species in the Triticeae and Aveneae tribes of the Poaceae family, it is probably mediated by HKT transporters. In other plants, high-affinity Na(+) uptake is mediated by one or several transporters whose responses to the presence of K(+) or Ba(2+) are fundamentally different from those of HKT transporters.
20018899	Overexpression of OsRAN2 in rice and Arabidopsis renders transgenic plants hypersensitive to salinity and osmotic stress.	2010	J Exp Bot	Nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of regulatory proteins is increasingly being recognized as a major control mechanism for the regulation of signalling in plants. Ras-related nuclear protein (Ran) GTPase is required for regulating transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope and also has roles in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope (NE) assembly. However, thus far little is known of any Ran functions in the signalling pathways in plants in response to changing environmental stimuli. The OsRAN2 gene, which has high homology (77% at the amino acid level) with its human counterpart, was isolated here. Subcellular localization results showed that OsRan2 is mainly localized in the nucleus, with some in the cytoplasm. Transcription of OsRAN2 was reduced by salt, osmotic, and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, as determined by real-time PCR. Overexpression of OsRAN2 in rice resulted in enhanced sensitivity to salinity, osmotic stress, and ABA. Seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing OsRAN2 were overly sensitive to salinity stress and exogenous ABA treatment. Furthermore, three ABA- or stress-responsive genes, AtNCED3, AtPLC1, and AtMYB2, encoding a key enzyme in ABA synthesis, a phospholipase C homologue, and a putative transcriptional factor, respectively, were shown to have differentially induced expression under salinity and ABA treatments in transgenic and wild-type Arabidopsis plants. OsRAN2 overexpression in tobacco epidermal leaf cells disturbed the nuclear import of a maize (Zea mays L.) leaf colour transcription factor (Lc). In addition, gene-silenced rice plants generated via RNA interference (RNAi) displayed pleiotropic developmental abnormalities and were male sterile.
20022921	TaSnRK2.4, an SNF1-type serine/threonine protein kinase of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), confers enhanced multistress tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2010	J Exp Bot	Osmotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold are major environmental factors that limit agricultural productivity worldwide. Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are major signalling events induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase2 family members play essential roles in response to hyperosmotic stresses in Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. In this study, the function of TaSnRK2.4 in drought, salt, and freezing stresses in Arabidopsis was characterized. A translational fusion protein of TaSnRK2.4 with green fluorescent protein showed subcellular localization in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. To examine the role of TaSnRK2.4 under various environmental stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing wheat TaSnRK2.4 under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots, and higher yield under normal growing conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSnRK2.4 had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, which were simultaneously supported by physiological results, including decreased rate of water loss, enhanced higher relative water content, strengthened cell membrane stability, improved photosynthesis potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential. The results show that TaSnRK2.4 is involved in the regulation of enhanced osmotic potential, growth, and development under both normal and stress conditions, and imply that TaSnRK2.4 is a multifunctional regulatory factor in Arabidopsis. Since the overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 can significantly strengthen tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses and does not retard the growth of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under well-watered conditions, TaSnRK2.4 could be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stresses in crops.
20022924	A major quantitative trait locus for increasing cadmium-specific concentration in rice grain is located on the short arm of chromosome 7.	2010	J Exp Bot	Large phenotypic variations in the cadmium (Cd) concentration of rice grains and shoots have been observed. However, the genetic control of Cd accumulation remains poorly understood. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) determining the grain Cd concentration of rice grown in a Cd-polluted paddy field were identified. Using a mapping population consisting of 85 backcross inbred lines derived from a cross between the low-Cd-accumulating cultivar Sasanishiki (japonica) and high-Cd-accumulating cultivar Habataki (indica), two QTLs for increasing grain Cd concentration were found on chromosomes 2 and 7. A major-effect QTL, qGCd7 (QTL for grain Cd on chromosome 7), was detected on the short arm of chromosome 7. It accounted for 35.5% of all phenotypic variance in backcross inbred lines. qGCd7 was not genetically related to any QTLs for concentrations of essential trace metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) or those for agronomic traits such as heading date, suggesting that this QTL is specific to Cd. Furthermore, the existence of qGCd7 was confirmed using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and an F(2) population from a cross between the target CSSL and Sasanishiki grown in a Cd-polluted paddy soil. To our knowledge, qGCd7 is a novel QTL with major effects for increasing grain Cd concentrations.
20080824	Overexpression of Osta-siR2141 caused abnormal polarity establishment and retarded growth in rice.	2010	J Exp Bot	Small RNAs (smRNAs) including miRNAs and siRNAs are critical for gene regulation and plant development. Among the highly diverse siRNAs, trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) have been shown to be plant-specific. In Arabidopsis, eight TAS loci belonging to four families (TAS1, TAS2, TAS3, and TAS4) have been identified, and bioinformatics analysis reveals that the sequence of TAS3 is highly conserved in plants. In this study, the function of TAS3 ta-siRNA (tasiR-ARF) has been revealed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) on polarity establishment and stage transition from vegetative to reproductive development by over-expressing Osta-siR2141. Osta-siR2141 replaced miR390 in the miR390 backbone for ectopic expression in rice, and overexpression of Osta-siR2141 caused disturbed vascular bundle development and adaxialization in polarity establishment. Transgenic lines also displayed abnormal shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and retarded growth at the vegetative stage. Molecular analysis revealed that overexpression of Osta-siR2141 resulted in the down-regulation of miR166 and the up-regulation of class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (HD-ZIPIIIs) in the vegetative stage but not in the reproductive stage. Moreover, overexpression of Osta-siR2141 in Arabidopsis disturbed polarity establishment and retarded stage transition, suggesting that tasiR-ARF was functionally conserved in rice and Arabidopsis.
20081045	Characterization of the rice PHO1 gene family reveals a key role for OsPHO1;2 in phosphate homeostasis and the evolution of a distinct clade in dicotyledons.	2010	Plant Physiol	Phosphate homeostasis was studied in a monocotyledonous model plant through the characterization of the PHO1 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genome has three PHO1 homologs, which cluster with the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPHO1 and AtPHO1;H1, the only two genes known to be involved in root-to-shoot transfer of phosphate. In contrast to the Arabidopsis PHO1 gene family, all three rice PHO1 genes have a cis-natural antisense transcript located at the 5 ' end of the genes. Strand-specific quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed distinct patterns of expression for sense and antisense transcripts for all three genes, both at the level of tissue expression and in response to nutrient stress. The most abundantly expressed gene was OsPHO1;2 in the roots, for both sense and antisense transcripts. However, while the OsPHO1;2 sense transcript was relatively stable under various nutrient deficiencies, the antisense transcript was highly induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Characterization of Ospho1;1 and Ospho1;2 insertion mutants revealed that only Ospho1;2 mutants had defects in Pi homeostasis, namely strong reduction in Pi transfer from root to shoot, which was accompanied by low-shoot and high-root Pi. Our data identify OsPHO1;2 as playing a key role in the transfer of Pi from roots to shoots in rice, and indicate that this gene could be regulated by its cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of PHO1 homologs in monocotyledons and dicotyledons revealed the emergence of a distinct clade of PHO1 genes in dicotyledons, which include members having roles other than long-distance Pi transport.
20097791	Cross-kingdom comparison of transcriptomic adjustments to low-oxygen stress highlights conserved and plant-specific responses.	2010	Plant Physiol	High-throughput technology has facilitated genome-scale analyses of transcriptomic adjustments in response to environmental perturbations with an oxygen deprivation component, such as transient hypoxia or anoxia, root waterlogging, or complete submergence. We showed previously that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings elevate the levels of hundreds of transcripts, including a core group of 49 genes that are prioritized for translation across cell types of both shoots and roots. To recognize low-oxygen responses that are evolutionarily conserved versus species specific, we compared the transcriptomic reconfiguration in 21 organisms from four kingdoms (Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, and Bacteria). Sorting of organism proteomes into clusters of putative orthologs identified broadly conserved responses associated with glycolysis, fermentation, alternative respiration, metabolite transport, reactive oxygen species amelioration, chaperone activity, and ribosome biogenesis. Differentially regulated genes involved in signaling and transcriptional regulation were poorly conserved across kingdoms. Strikingly, nearly half of the induced mRNAs of Arabidopsis seedlings encode proteins of unknown function, of which over 40% had up-regulated orthologs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa), rice (Oryza sativa), or Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Sixteen HYPOXIA-RESPONSIVE UNKNOWN PROTEIN (HUP) genes, including four that are Arabidopsis specific, were ectopically overexpressed and evaluated for their effect on seedling tolerance to oxygen deprivation. This allowed the identification of HUPs coregulated with genes associated with anaerobic metabolism and other processes that significantly enhance or reduce stress survival when ectopically overexpressed. These findings illuminate both broadly conserved and plant-specific low-oxygen stress responses and confirm that plant-specific HUPs with limited phylogenetic distribution influence low-oxygen stress endurance.
20100339	Transcriptional regulatory network triggered by oxidative signals configures the early response mechanisms of japonica rice to chilling stress.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The transcriptional regulatory network involved in low temperature response leading to acclimation has been established in Arabidopsis. In japonica rice, which can only withstand transient exposure to milder cold stress (10 degrees C), an oxidative-mediated network has been proposed to play a key role in configuring early responses and short-term defenses. The components, hierarchical organization and physiological consequences of this network were further dissected by a systems-level approach.

RESULTS: Regulatory clusters responding directly to oxidative signals were prominent during the initial 6 to 12 hours at 10 degrees C. Early events mirrored a typical oxidative response based on striking similarities of the transcriptome to disease, elicitor and wounding induced processes. Targets of oxidative-mediated mechanisms are likely regulated by several classes of bZIP factors acting on as1/ocs/TGA-like element enriched clusters, ERF factors acting on GCC-box/JAre-like element enriched clusters and R2R3-MYB factors acting on MYB2-like element enriched clusters.Temporal induction of several H2O2-induced bZIP, ERF and MYB genes coincided with the transient H2O2 spikes within the initial 6 to 12 hours. Oxidative-independent responses involve DREB/CBF, RAP2 and RAV1 factors acting on DRE/CRT/rav1-like enriched clusters and bZIP factors acting on ABRE-like enriched clusters. Oxidative-mediated clusters were activated earlier than ABA-mediated clusters.

CONCLUSION: Genome-wide, physiological and whole-plant level analyses established a holistic view of chilling stress response mechanism of japonica rice. Early response regulatory network triggered by oxidative signals is critical for prolonged survival under sub-optimal temperature. Integration of stress and developmental responses leads to modulated growth and vigor maintenance contributing to a delay of plastic injuries.
20107022	The submergence tolerance regulator Sub1A mediates stress-responsive expression of AP2/ERF transcription factors.	2010	Plant Physiol	We previously characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) Submergence1 (Sub1) locus encoding three ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators. Genotypes carrying the Sub1A-1 allele are tolerant of prolonged submergence. To elucidate the mechanism of Sub1A-1-mediated tolerance, we performed transcriptome analyses comparing the temporal submergence response of Sub1A-1-containing tolerant M202(Sub1) with the intolerant isoline M202 lacking this gene. We identified 898 genes displaying Sub1A-1-dependent regulation. Integration of the expression data with publicly available metabolic pathway data identified submergence tolerance-associated pathways governing anaerobic respiration, hormone responses, and antioxidant systems. Of particular interest were a set of APETALA2 (AP2)/ERF family transcriptional regulators that are associated with the Sub1A-1-mediated response upon submergence. Visualization of expression patterns of the AP2/ERF superfamily members in a phylogenetic context resolved 12 submergence-regulated AP2/ERFs into three putative functional groups: (1) anaerobic respiration and cytokinin-mediated delay in senescence via ethylene accumulation during submergence (three ERFs); (2) negative regulation of ethylene-dependent gene expression (five ERFs); and (3) negative regulation of gibberellin-mediated shoot elongation (four ERFs). These results confirm that the presence of Sub1A-1 impacts multiple pathways of response to submergence.
20109239	Comprehensive expression analysis suggests overlapping and specific roles of rice glutathione S-transferase genes during development and stress responses.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are the ubiquitous enzymes that play a key role in cellular detoxification. Although several GSTs have been identified and characterized in various plant species, the knowledge about their role in developmental processes and response to various stimuli is still very limited. In this study, we report genome-wide identification, characterization and comprehensive expression analysis of members of GST gene family in crop plant rice, to reveal their function(s).

RESULTS: A systematic analysis revealed the presence of at least 79 GST genes in the rice genome. Phylogenetic analysis grouped GST proteins into seven classes. Sequence analysis together with the organization of putative motifs indicated the potential diverse functions of GST gene family members in rice. The tandem gene duplications have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family. Microarray data analysis revealed tissue-/organ- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of several rice GST genes. At least 31 GST genes showed response to plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Furthermore, expression analysis showed the differential expression of quite a large number of GST genes during various abiotic stress (20), arsenate stress (32) and biotic stress (48) conditions. Many of the GST genes were commonly regulated by developmental processes, hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses.

CONCLUSION: The transcript profiling suggests overlapping and specific role(s) of GSTs during various stages of development in rice. Further, the study provides evidence for the role of GSTs in mediating crosstalk between various stress and hormone response pathways and represents a very useful resource for functional analysis of selected members of this family in rice.
20122142	Genome-wide gene responses in a transgenic rice line carrying the maize resistance gene Rxo1 to the rice bacterial streak pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Non-host resistance in rice to its bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), mediated by a maize NBS-LRR type R gene, Rxo1 shows a typical hypersensitive reaction (HR) phenotype, but the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this type of non-host resistance remain largely unknown.

RESULTS: A microarray experiment was performed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying HR of rice to Xoc mediated by Rxo1 using a pair of transgenic and non-transgenic rice lines. Our results indicated that Rxo1 appeared to function in the very early step of the interaction between rice and Xoc, and could specifically activate large numbers of genes involved in signaling pathways leading to HR and some basal defensive pathways such as SA and ET pathways. In the former case, Rxo1 appeared to differ from the typical host R genes in that it could lead to HR without activating NDR1. In the latter cases, Rxo1 was able to induce a unique group of WRKY TF genes and a large set of genes encoding PPR and RRM proteins that share the same G-box in their promoter regions with possible functions in post-transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Rxo1, like most host R genes, was able to trigger HR against Xoc in the heterologous rice plants by activating multiple defensive pathways related to HR, providing useful information on the evolution of plant resistance genes. Maize non-host resistance gene Rxo1 could trigger the pathogen-specific HR in heterologous rice, and ultimately leading to a localized programmed cell death which exhibits the characteristics consistent with those mediated by host resistance genes, but a number of genes encoding pentatricopeptide repeat and RNA recognition motif protein were found specifically up-regulated in the Rxo1 mediated disease resistance. These results add to our understanding the evolution of plant resistance genes.
20130099	A novel MYBS3-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings are particularly sensitive to chilling in early spring in temperate and subtropical zones and in high-elevation areas. Improvement of chilling tolerance in rice may significantly increase rice production. MYBS3 is a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice. In this study, we observed that MYBS3 also plays a critical role in cold adaptation in rice. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that MYBS3 was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice. Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing MYBS3 tolerated 4 degrees C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions. Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing or underexpressing MYBS3 led to the identification of many genes in the MYBS3-mediated cold signaling pathway. Several genes activated by MYBS3 as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species. Surprisingly, MYBS3 repressed the well-known DREB1/CBF-dependent cold signaling pathway in rice, and the repression appears to act at the transcriptional level. DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while MYBS3 responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short- and long-term cold stress in rice. Our studies thus reveal a hitherto undiscovered novel pathway that controls cold adaptation in rice.
20130100	Abscisic acid-induced resistance against the brown spot pathogen Cochliobolus miyabeanus in rice involves MAP kinase-mediated repression of ethylene signaling.	2010	Plant Physiol	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in an array of plant processes, including the regulation of gene expression during adaptive responses to various environmental cues. Apart from its well-established role in abiotic stress adaptation, emerging evidence indicates that ABA is also prominently involved in the regulation and integration of pathogen defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that exogenously administered ABA enhances basal resistance of rice (Oryza sativa) against the brown spot-causing ascomycete Cochliobolus miyabeanus. Microscopic analysis of early infection events in control and ABA-treated plants revealed that this ABA-inducible resistance (ABA-IR) is based on restriction of fungal progression in the mesophyll. We also show that ABA-IR does not rely on boosted expression of salicylic acid-, jasmonic acid -, or callose-dependent resistance mechanisms but, instead, requires a functional Galpha-protein. In addition, several lines of evidence are presented suggesting that ABA steers its positive effect on brown spot resistance through antagonistic cross talk with the ethylene (ET) response pathway. Exogenous ethephon application enhances susceptibility, whereas genetic disruption of ET signaling renders plants less vulnerable to C. miyabeanus attack, thereby inducing a level of resistance similar to that observed on ABA-treated wild-type plants. Moreover, ABA treatment alleviates C. miyabeanus-induced activation of the ET reporter gene EBP89, while derepression of pathogen-triggered EBP89 transcription via RNA interference-mediated knockdown of OsMPK5, an ABA-primed mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, compromises ABA-IR. Collectively, these data favor a model whereby exogenous ABA enhances resistance against C. miyabeanus at least in part by suppressing pathogen-induced ET action in an OsMPK5-dependent manner.
20135324	Over-expression of osa-MIR396c decreases salt and alkali stress tolerance.	2010	Planta	Salt and alkali stress are two of the main environmental factors limiting rice production. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of salinity and alkali stress tolerance is necessary to modify rice to increase its resistance to salinity and alkaline stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs that are ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. In plants, miRNAs constitute one of five classes of small RNAs that function primarily as negative regulators for gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Several plant miRNAs, such as miR396, play vital roles in plant growth, development and resistance to stresses. In this study, we identified osa-MIR396c, which shows dramatic transcript change under salt and alkali stress conditions in Oryza sativa. We designed an experiment to detect miRNA-target interaction and demonstrated that several transcription factors related to growth, development, and stress tolerance are targeted by osa-MIR396c. Transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana plants constitutively over-expressing osa-MIR396c showed reduced salt and alkali stress tolerance compared to that of wild-type plants. Overall, this study further established a link between salt and alkali stress and osa-MIR396c in rice.
20141629	Genome-wide analysis of rice ClpB/HSP100, ClpC and ClpD genes.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: ClpB-cyt/HSP100 protein acts as chaperone, mediating disaggregation of denatured proteins. Previous studies have shown that ClpB-cyt/HSP100 gene belongs to the group class I Clp ATPase proteins and ClpB-cyt/HSP100 transcript is regulated by heat stress and developmental cues.

RESULTS: Nine ORFs were noted to constitute rice class I Clp ATPases in the following manner: 3 ClpB proteins (ClpB-cyt, Os05g44340; ClpB-m, Os02g08490; ClpB-c, Os03g31300), 4 ClpC proteins (ClpC1, Os04g32560; ClpC2, Os12g12580; ClpC3, Os11g16590; ClpC4, Os11g16770) and 2 ClpD proteins (ClpD1, Os02g32520; ClpD2, Os04g33210). Using the respective signal sequences cloned upstream to GFP/CFP reporter proteins and transient expression studies with onion epidermal cells, evidence is provided that rice ClpB-m and Clp-c proteins are indeed localized to their respective cell locations mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. Associated with their diverse cell locations, domain structures of OsClpB-c, OsClpB-m and OsClpB-cyt proteins are noted to possess a high-level conservation. OsClpB-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development. While expression of OsClpB-m was significantly less as compared to its cytoplasmic and chloroplastic counterparts in different tissues, this transcript showed highest heat-induced expression amongst the 3 ClpB proteins. OsClpC1 and OsClpC2 are predicted to be chloroplast-localized as is the case with all known plant ClpC proteins. However, the fact that OsClpC3 protein appears mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and OsClpC4 a plasma membrane protein reflects functional diversity of this class. Different class I Clp ATPase transcripts were noted to be cross-induced by a host of different abiotic stress conditions. Complementation assays of Deltahsp104 mutant yeast cells showed that OsClpB-cyt, OsClpB-m, OsClpC1 and OsClpD1 have significantly positive effects. Remarkably, OsClpD1 gene imparted appreciably high level tolerance to the mutant yeast cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Rice class I Clp ATPase gene family is constituted of 9 members. Of these 9, only 3 belonging to ClpB group are heat stress regulated. Distribution of ClpB proteins to different cell organelles indicates that their functioning might be critical in different cell locations. From the complementation assays, OsClpD1 appears to be more effective than OsClpB-cyt protein in rescuing the thermosensitive defect of the yeast ScDeltahsp104 mutant cells.
20167122	Massive gene losses in Asian cultivated rice unveiled by comparative genome analysis.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. With increasing world demand for food crops, there is an urgent need to develop new cultivars that have enhanced performance with regard to yield, disease resistance, and so on. Wild rice is expected to provide useful genetic resources that could improve the present cultivated species. However, the quantity and quality of these unexplored resources remain unclear. Recent accumulation of the genomic information of both cultivated and wild rice species allows for their comparison at the molecular level. Here, we compared the genome sequence of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica with sets of bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences (BESs) from two wild rice species, O. rufipogon and O. nivara, and an African rice species, O. glaberrima.

RESULTS: We found that about four to five percent of the BESs of the two wild rice species and about seven percent of the African rice could not be mapped to the japonica genome, suggesting that a substantial number of genes have been lost in the japonica rice lineage; however, their close relatives still possess their counterpart genes. We estimated that during evolution, O. sativa has lost at least one thousand genes that are still preserved in the genomes of the other species. In addition, our BLASTX searches against the non-redundant protein sequence database showed that disease resistance-related proteins were significantly overrepresented in the close relative-specific genomic portions. In total, 235 unmapped BESs of the three relatives matched 83 non-redundant proteins that contained a disease resistance protein domain, most of which corresponded to an NBS-LRR domain.

CONCLUSION: We found that the O. sativa lineage appears to have recently experienced massive gene losses following divergence from its wild ancestor. Our results imply that the domestication process accelerated large-scale genomic deletions in the lineage of Asian cultivated rice and that the close relatives of cultivated rice have the potential to restore the lost traits.
20193092	An unedited 1.1 kb mitochondrial orfB gene transcript in the wild abortive cytoplasmic male sterility (WA-CMS) system of Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The application of hybrid rice technology has significantly increased global rice production during the last three decades. Approximately 90% of the commercially cultivated rice hybrids have been derived through three-line breeding involving the use of WA-CMS lines. It is believed that during the 21st century, hybrid rice technology will make significant contributions to ensure global food security. This study examined the poorly understood molecular basis of the WA-CMS system in rice.

RESULTS: RFLPs were detected for atp6 and orfB genes in sterile and fertile rice lines, with one copy of each in the mt-genome. The RNA profile was identical in both lines for atp6, but an additional longer orfB transcript was identified in sterile lines. 5' RACE analysis of the long orfB transcript revealed it was 370 bp longer than the normal transcript, with no indication it was chimeric when compared to the genomic DNA sequence. cDNA clones of the longer orfB transcript in sterile lines were sequenced and the transcript was determined unedited. Sterile lines were crossed with the restorer and maintainer lines, and fertile and sterile F1 hybrids were respectively generated. Both hybrids contained two types of orfB transcripts. However, the long transcript underwent editing in the fertile F1 hybrids and remained unedited in the sterile lines. Additionally, the editing of the 1.1 kb orfB transcript co-segregated with fertility restoring alleles in a segregating population of F2 progeny; and the presence of unedited long orfB transcripts was detected in the sterile plants from the F2 segregating population.

CONCLUSION: This study helped to assign plausible operative factors responsible for male-sterility in the WA cytoplasm of rice. A new point of departure to dissect the mechanisms governing the CMS-WA system in rice has been identified, which can be applied to further harness the opportunities afforded by hybrid vigor in rice.
20213122	Identification and organization of chloroplastic and cytosolic L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase coding gene(s) in Oryza sativa: comparison with the wild halophytic rice, Porteresia coarctata.	2010	Planta	The gene coding for rice chloroplastic L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS; EC 5.5.1.4) has been identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the purified and immunologically cross-reactive approximately 60 kDa chloroplastic protein following two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which exhibited sequence identity with the cytosolic MIPS coded by OsINO1-1 gene. A possible chloroplastic transit peptide sequence was identified upstream of the OsINO1-1 gene upon analysis of rice genome. RT-PCR and confocal microscope studies confirmed transcription, effective translation and its functioning as a chloroplast transit peptide. Bioinformatic analysis mapped the chloroplastic MIPS (OsINO1-1) gene on chromosome 3, and a second MIPS gene (OsINO1-2) on chromosome 10 which lacks conventional chloroplast transit peptide sequence as in OsINO1-1. Two new PcINO1 genes, with characteristic promoter activity and upstream cis-elements were identified and cloned, but whether these proteins can be translocated to the chloroplast or not is yet to be ascertained. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay carried out with nuclear extract of Porteresia coarctata leaves grown under both control and stressed condition shows binding of nuclear proteins with the upstream elements. Nucleotide divergence among the different Oryza and Porteresia INO1 genes were calculated and compared.
20214804	The Puf family of RNA-binding proteins in plants: phylogeny, structural modeling, activity and subcellular localization.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Puf proteins have important roles in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by promoting RNA decay and repressing translation. The Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD) is a conserved region within Puf proteins that binds to RNA with sequence specificity. Although Puf proteins have been well characterized in animal and fungal systems, little is known about the structural and functional characteristics of Puf-like proteins in plants.

RESULTS: The Arabidopsis and rice genomes code for 26 and 19 Puf-like proteins, respectively, each possessing eight or fewer Puf repeats in their PUM-HD. Key amino acids in the PUM-HD of several of these proteins are conserved with those of animal and fungal homologs, whereas other plant Puf proteins demonstrate extensive variability in these amino acids. Three-dimensional modeling revealed that the predicted structure of this domain in plant Puf proteins provides a suitable surface for binding RNA. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments showed that the Arabidopsis AtPum2 PUM-HD binds with high affinity to BoxB of the Drosophila Nanos Response Element I (NRE1) RNA, whereas a point mutation in the core of the NRE1 resulted in a significant reduction in binding affinity. Transient expression of several of the Arabidopsis Puf proteins as fluorescent protein fusions revealed a dynamic, punctate cytoplasmic pattern of localization for most of these proteins. The presence of predicted nuclear export signals and accumulation of AtPuf proteins in the nucleus after treatment of cells with leptomycin B demonstrated that shuttling of these proteins between the cytosol and nucleus is common among these proteins. In addition to the cytoplasmically enriched AtPum proteins, two AtPum proteins showed nuclear targeting with enrichment in the nucleolus.

CONCLUSIONS: The Puf family of RNA-binding proteins in plants consists of a greater number of members than any other model species studied to date. This, along with the amino acid variability observed within their PUM-HDs, suggests that these proteins may be involved in a wide range of post-transcriptional regulatory events that are important in providing plants with the ability to respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and throughout development.
20222994	TC-motifs at the TATA-box expected position in plant genes: a novel class of motifs involved in the transcription regulation.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The TATA-box and TATA-variants are regulatory elements involved in the formation of a transcription initiation complex. Both have been conserved throughout evolution in a restricted region close to the Transcription Start Site (TSS). However, less than half of the genes in model organisms studied so far have been found to contain either one of these elements. Indeed different core-promoter elements are involved in the recruitment of the TATA-box-binding protein. Here we assessed the possibility of identifying novel functional motifs in plant genes, sharing the TATA-box topological constraints.

RESULTS: We developed an ab-initio approach considering the preferential location of motifs relative to the TSS. We identified motifs observed at the TATA-box expected location and conserved in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa promoters. We identified TC-elements within non-TA-rich promoters 30 bases upstream of the TSS. As with the TATA-box and TATA-variant sequences, it was possible to construct a unique distance graph with the TC-element sequences. The structural and functional features of TC-element-containing genes were distinct from those of TATA-box- or TATA-variant-containing genes. Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome analysis revealed that TATA-box-containing genes were generally those showing relatively high levels of expression and that TC-element-containing genes were generally those expressed in specific conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the TC-elements might constitute a class of novel regulatory elements participating towards the complex modulation of gene expression in plants.
20231330	Glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins are functionally conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa during cold adaptation process.	2010	J Exp Bot	Contrary to the increasing amount of knowledge regarding the functional roles of glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs) in Arabidopsis thaliana in stress responses, the physiological functions of GRPs in rice (Oryza sativa) currently remain largely unknown. In this study, the functional roles of six OsGRPs from rice on the growth of E. coli and plants under cold or freezing stress conditions have been evaluated. Among the six OsGRPs investigated, OsGRP1, OsGRP4, and OsGRP6 were shown to have the ability to complement cold-sensitive BX04 E. coli mutant cells under low temperature conditions, and this complementation ability was correlated closely with their DNA- and RNA-melting abilities. Moreover, OsGRP1 and OsGRP4 rescued the growth-defect of a cold-sensitive Arabidopsis grp7 mutant plant under cold and freezing stress, and OsGRP6 conferred freezing tolerance in the grp7 mutant plant, in which the expression of AtGRP7 was suppressed and is sensitive to cold and freezing stresses. OsGRP4 and OsGRP6 complemented the defect in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in grp7 mutants during cold stress. Considering that AtGRP7 confers freezing tolerance in plants and harbours RNA chaperone activity during the cold adaptation process, the results of the present study provide evidence that GRPs in rice and Arabidopsis are functionally conserved, and also suggest that GRPs perform a function as RNA chaperones during the cold adaptation process in monocotyledonous plants, as well as in dicotyledonous plants.
20298594	wDBTF: an integrated database resource for studying wheat transcription factor families.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting with promoters of their target genes and are classified into families based on their DNA-binding domains. Genes coding for TFs have been identified in the sequences of model plant genomes. The rice (Oryza sativa spp. japonica) genome contains 2,384 TF gene models, which represent the mRNA transcript of a locus, classed into 63 families.

RESULTS: We have created an extensive list of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) TF sequences based on sequence homology with rice TFs identified and classified in the Database of Rice Transcription Factors (DRTF). We have identified 7,112 wheat sequences (contigs and singletons) from a dataset of 1,033,960 expressed sequence tag and mRNA (ET) sequences available. This number is about three times the number of TFs in rice so proportionally is very similar if allowance is made for the hexaploidy of wheat. Of these sequences 3,820 encode gene products with a DNA-binding domain and thus were confirmed as potential regulators. These 3,820 sequences were classified into 40 families and 84 subfamilies and some members defined orphan families. The results were compiled in the Database of Wheat Transcription Factor (wDBTF), an inventory available on the web http://wwwappli.nantes.inra.fr:8180/wDBFT/. For each accession, a link to its library source and its Affymetrix identification number is provided. The positions of Pfam (protein family database) motifs were given when known.

CONCLUSIONS: wDBTF collates 3,820 wheat TF sequences validated by the presence of a DNA-binding domain out of 7,112 potential TF sequences identified from publicly available gene expression data. We also incorporated in silico expression data on these TFs into the database. Thus this database provides a major resource for systematic studies of TF families and their expression in wheat as illustrated here in a study of DOF family members expressed during seed development.
20335401	Root-specific expression of OsNAC10 improves drought tolerance and grain yield in rice under field drought conditions.	2010	Plant Physiol	Drought poses a serious threat to the sustainability of rice (Oryza sativa) yields in rain-fed agriculture. Here, we report the results of a functional genomics approach that identified a rice NAC (an acronym for NAM [No Apical Meristem], ATAF1-2, and CUC2 [Cup-Shaped Cotyledon]) domain gene, OsNAC10, which improved performance of transgenic rice plants under field drought conditions. Of the 140 OsNAC genes predicted in rice, 18 were identified to be induced by stress conditions. Phylogenic analysis of the 18 OsNAC genes revealed the presence of three subgroups with distinct signature motifs. A group of OsNAC genes were prescreened for enhanced stress tolerance when overexpressed in rice. OsNAC10, one of the effective members selected from prescreening, is expressed predominantly in roots and panicles and induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid. Overexpression of OsNAC10 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter GOS2 and the root-specific promoter RCc3 increased the plant tolerance to drought, high salinity, and low temperature at the vegetative stage. More importantly, the RCc3:OsNAC10 plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 25% to 42% and by 5% to 14% over controls in the field under drought and normal conditions, respectively. Grain yield of GOS2:OsNAC10 plants in the field, in contrast, remained similar to that of controls under both normal and drought conditions. These differences in performance under field drought conditions reflect the differences in expression of OsNAC10-dependent target genes in roots as well as in leaves of the two transgenic plants, as revealed by microarray analyses. Root diameter of the RCc3:OsNAC10 plants was thicker by 1.25-fold than that of the GOS2:OsNAC10 and nontransgenic plants due to the enlarged stele, cortex, and epidermis. Overall, our results demonstrated that root-specific overexpression of OsNAC10 enlarges roots, enhancing drought tolerance of transgenic plants, which increases grain yield significantly under field drought conditions.
20346185	Discovery of global genomic re-organization based on comparison of two newly sequenced rice mitochondrial genomes with cytoplasmic male sterility-related genes.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant mitochondrial genomes are known for their complexity, and there is abundant evidence demonstrating that this organelle is important for plant sexual reproduction. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a phenomenon caused by incompatibility between the nucleus and mitochondria that has been discovered in various plant species. As the exact sequence of steps leading to CMS has not yet been revealed, efforts should be made to elucidate the factors underlying the mechanism of this important trait for crop breeding.

RESULTS: Two CMS mitochondrial genomes, LD-CMS, derived from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica (434,735 bp), and CW-CMS, derived from Oryza rufipogon Griff. (559,045 bp), were newly sequenced in this study. Compared to the previously sequenced Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) mitochondrial genome, the presence of 54 out of 56 protein-encoding genes (including pseudo-genes), 22 tRNA genes (including pseudo-tRNAs), and three rRNA genes was conserved. Two other genes were not present in the CW-CMS mitochondrial genome, and one of them was present as part of the newly identified chimeric ORF, CW-orf307. At least 12 genomic recombination events were predicted between the LD-CMS mitochondrial genome and Nipponbare, and 15 between the CW-CMS genome and Nipponbare, and novel genetic structures were formed by these genomic rearrangements in the two CMS lines. At least one of the genomic rearrangements was completely unique to each CMS line and not present in 69 rice cultivars or 9 accessions of O. rufipogon.

CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate novel mitochondrial genomic rearrangements that are unique in CMS cytoplasm, and one of the genes that is unique in the CW mitochondrial genome, CW-orf307, appeared to be the candidate most likely responsible for the CW-CMS event. Genomic rearrangements were dynamic in the CMS lines in comparison with those of rice cultivars, suggesting that 'death' and possible 'birth' processes of the CMS genes occurred during the breeding history of rice.
20353606	Defining reference genes in Oryza sativa using organ, development, biotic and abiotic transcriptome datasets.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Reference genes are widely used to normalise transcript abundance data determined by quantitative RT-PCR and microarrays. However, the approaches taken to define reference genes can be variable. Although Oryza sativa (rice) is a widely used model plant and important crop specie, there has been no comprehensive analysis carried out to define superior reference genes.

RESULTS: Analysis of 136 Affymetrix transcriptome datasets comprising of 373 genome microarrays from studies in rice that encompass tissue, developmental, abiotic, biotic and hormonal transcriptome datasets identified 151 genes whose expression was considered relatively stable under all conditions. A sub-set of 12 of these genes were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and were seen to be stable under a number of conditions. All except one gene that has been previously proposed as a stably expressed gene for rice, were observed to change significantly under some treatment.

CONCLUSION: A new set of reference genes that are stable across tissue, development, stress and hormonal treatments have been identified in rice. This provides a superior set of reference genes for future studies in rice. It confirms the approach of mining large scale datasets as a robust method to define reference genes, but cautions against using gene orthology or counterparts of reference genes in other plant species as a means of defining reference genes.
20357136	Arabidopsis RAP2.2: an ethylene response transcription factor that is important for hypoxia survival.	2010	Plant Physiol	Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) RAP2.2 (At3g14230) is an APETALA2/ethylene response factor-type transcription factor that belongs to the same subfamily as the rice (Oryza sativa) submergence tolerance gene SUB1A. RAP2.2 is expressed at constitutively high levels in the roots and at lower levels in the shoots, where it is induced by darkness. Effector studies and analysis of ethylene signal transduction mutants indicate that RAP2.2 is induced in shoots by ethylene and functions in an ethylene-controlled signal transduction pathway. Overexpression of RAP2.2 resulted in improved plant survival under hypoxia (low-oxygen) stress, whereas lines containing T-DNA knockouts of the gene had poorer survival rates than the wild type. This indicates that RAP2.2 is important in a plant's ability to resist hypoxia stress. Observation of the expression pattern of 32 low-oxygen and ethylene-associated genes showed that RAP2.2 affects only part of the low-oxygen response, particularly the induction of genes encoding sugar metabolism and fermentation pathway enzymes, as well as ethylene biosynthesis genes. Our results provide a new insight on the regulation of gene expression under low-oxygen conditions. Lighting plays an important regulatory role and is intertwined with hypoxia conditions; both stimuli may act collaboratively to regulate the hypoxic response.
20357140	Regulation of microbe-associated molecular pattern-induced hypersensitive cell death, phytoalexin production, and defense gene expression by calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases, OsCIPK14/15, in rice cultured cells.	2010	Plant Physiol	Although cytosolic free Ca(2+) mobilization induced by microbe/pathogen-associated molecular patterns is postulated to play a pivotal role in innate immunity in plants, the molecular links between Ca(2+) and downstream defense responses still remain largely unknown. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) act as Ca(2+) sensors to activate specific protein kinases, CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). We here identified two CIPKs, OsCIPK14 and OsCIPK15, rapidly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, including chitooligosaccharides and xylanase (Trichoderma viride/ethylene-inducing xylanase [TvX/EIX]), in rice (Oryza sativa). Although they are located on different chromosomes, they have over 95% nucleotide sequence identity, including the surrounding genomic region, suggesting that they are duplicated genes. OsCIPK14/15 interacted with several OsCBLs through the FISL/NAF motif in yeast cells and showed the strongest interaction with OsCBL4. The recombinant OsCIPK14/15 proteins showed Mn(2+)-dependent protein kinase activity, which was enhanced both by deletion of their FISL/NAF motifs and by combination with OsCBL4. OsCIPK14/15-RNAi transgenic cell lines showed reduced sensitivity to TvX/EIX for the induction of a wide range of defense responses, including hypersensitive cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, phytoalexin biosynthesis, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. On the other hand, TvX/EIX-induced cell death was enhanced in OsCIPK15-overexpressing lines. Our results suggest that OsCIPK14/15 play a crucial role in the microbe-associated molecular pattern-induced defense signaling pathway in rice cultured cells.
20395452	The SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 is required for rice inflorescence and spikelet development.	2010	Plant Physiol	Grass plants develop distinct inflorescences and spikelets that determine grain yields. However, the mechanisms underlying the specification of inflorescences and spikelets in grasses remain largely unknown. Here, we report the biological role of one SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, OsMADS34, in controlling the development of inflorescences and spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa). OsMADS34 encodes a MADS box protein containing a short carboxyl terminus without transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. We demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of OsMADS34 in roots, leaves, and primordia of inflorescence and spikelet organs. Compared with the wild type, osmads34 mutants developed altered inflorescence morphology, with an increased number of primary branches and a decreased number of secondary branches. In addition, osmads34 mutants displayed a decreased spikelet number and altered spikelet morphology, with lemma/leaf-like elongated sterile lemmas. Moreover, analysis of the double mutant osmads34 osmads1 suggests that OsMADS34 specifies the identities of floral organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another rice SEP-like gene, OsMADS1. Collectively, our study suggests that the origin and diversification of OsMADS34 and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets.
20421194	Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa.	2010	J Exp Bot	Long chain prenyl diphosphates are crucial biosynthetic precursors of ubiquinone (UQ) in many organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans, as well as precursors of plastoquinone in photosynthetic organisms. The cloning and characterization of two solanesyl diphosphate synthase genes, OsSPS1 and OsSPS2, in Oryza sativa is reported here. OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas OsSPS2 was found to be high in both leaves and roots. Enzymatic characterization using recombinant proteins showed that both OsSPS1 and OsSPS2 could produce solanesyl diphosphates as their final product, while OsSPS1 showed stronger activity than OsSPS2. However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas OsSPS2 only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant. HPLC analyses showed that both OsSPS1 and OsSPS2 yeast transformants produced UQ9 instead of UQ6, which is the native yeast UQ. According to the complementation study, the UQ9 levels in OsSPS2 transformants were much lower than that of OsSPS1. Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while OsSPS2 localized to plastids. This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas OsSPS2 is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation. These findings indicate that O. sativa has a different mechanism for the supply of isoprenoid precursors in UQ biosynthesis from Arabidopsis thaliana, in which SPS1 provides a prenyl moiety for UQ9 at the endoplasmic reticulum.
20423940	Genome-wide identification, classification, and expression analysis of the arabinogalactan protein gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	J Exp Bot	Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) comprise a family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are implicated in plant growth and development. In this study, 69 AGPs are identified from the rice genome, including 13 classical AGPs, 15 arabinogalactan (AG) peptides, three non-classical AGPs, three early nodulin-like AGPs (eNod-like AGPs), eight non-specific lipid transfer protein-like AGPs (nsLTP-like AGPs), and 27 fasciclin-like AGPs (FLAs). The results from expressed sequence tags, microarrays, and massively parallel signature sequencing tags are used to analyse the expression of AGP-encoding genes, which is confirmed by real-time PCR. The results reveal that several rice AGP-encoding genes are predominantly expressed in anthers and display differential expression patterns in response to abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and abiotic stresses. Based on the results obtained from this analysis, an attempt has been made to link the protein structures and expression patterns of rice AGP-encoding genes to their functions. Taken together, the genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the rice AGP gene family might facilitate further functional studies of rice AGPs.
20441221	Changes in protein expression profiles between a low phytic acid rice ( Oryza sativa L. Ssp. japonica) line and its parental line: a proteomic and bioinformatic approach.	2010	J Agric Food Chem	The seed proteome of a low phytic acid (lpa) rice line (Os-lpa-XS110-1), developed as a novel food source, was compared to that of its parental line, Xiushui 110 (XS-110). Analysis by surfaced enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) allowed the detection of a potential low molecular weight biomarker and identification of 23 differentially expressed proteins that include stress-related proteins, storage proteins, and potential allergens. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and fructose bisphosphatealdolase (FBA), two major differentially expressed proteins, are involved in myo-inositol metabolism. Accumulation of globulin was also significantly decreased in the lpa line. This study demonstrates the potential of proteomic and bioinformatic profiling techniques for safety assessment of novel foods. Furthermore, these techniques provide powerful tools for studying functional genomics due to the possibility of identifying genes related to the mutated traits.
20472577	Putrescine differently influences the effect of salt stress on polyamine metabolism and ethylene synthesis in rice cultivars differing in salt resistance.	2010	J Exp Bot	Effects of salt stress on polyamine metabolism and ethylene production were examined in two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars [I Kong Pao (IKP), salt sensitive; and Pokkali, salt resistant] grown for 5 d and 12 d in nutrient solution in the presence or absence of putrescine (1 mM) and 0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl. The salt-sensitive (IKP) and salt-resistant (Pokkali) cultivars differ not only in their mean levels of putrescine, but also in the physiological functions assumed by this molecule in stressed tissues. Salt stress increased the proportion of conjugated putrescine in salt-resistant Pokkali and decreased it in the salt-sensitive IKP, suggesting a possible protective function in response to NaCl. Activities of the enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC 4.1.1.17) and arginine decarboxylase (ADC; EC 4.1.1.19) involved in putrescine synthesis were higher in salt-resistant Pokkali than in salt-sensitive IKP. Both enzymes were involved in the response to salt stress. Salt stress also increased diamine oxidase (DAO; 1.4.3.6) and polyamine oxidase (PAO EC 1.5.3.11) activities in the roots of salt-resistant Pokkali and in the shoots of salt-sensitive IKP. Gene expression followed by reverse transcription-PCR suggested that putrescine could have a post-translational impact on genes coding for ADC (ADCa) and ODC (ODCa and ODCb) but could induce a transcriptional activation of genes coding for PAO (PAOb) mainly in the shoot of salt-stressed plants. The salt-resistant cultivar Pokkali produced higher amounts of ethylene than the salt-sensitive cultivar IKP, and exogenous putrescine increased ethylene synthesis in both cultivars, suggesting no direct antagonism between polyamine and ethylene pathways in rice.
20472752	Genome-wide classification and evolutionary analysis of the bHLH family of transcription factors in Arabidopsis, poplar, rice, moss, and algae.	2010	Plant Physiol	Basic helix-loop-helix proteins (bHLHs) are found throughout the three eukaryotic kingdoms and constitute one of the largest families of transcription factors. A growing number of bHLH proteins have been functionally characterized in plants. However, some of these have not been previously classified. We present here an updated and comprehensive classification of the bHLHs encoded by the whole sequenced genomes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, and five algae species. We define a plant bHLH consensus motif, which allowed the identification of novel highly diverged atypical bHLHs. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we confirm that (1) a highly diverged bHLH has retained protein interaction activity and (2) the two most conserved positions in the consensus play an essential role in dimerization. Phylogenetic analysis permitted classification of the 638 bHLH genes identified into 32 subfamilies. Evolutionary and functional relationships within subfamilies are supported by intron patterns, predicted DNA-binding motifs, and the architecture of conserved protein motifs. Our analyses reveal the origin and evolutionary diversification of plant bHLHs through differential expansions, domain shuffling, and extensive sequence divergence. At the functional level, this would translate into different subfamilies evolving specific DNA-binding and protein interaction activities as well as differential transcriptional regulatory roles. Our results suggest a role for bHLH proteins in generating plant phenotypic diversity and provide a solid framework for further investigations into the role carried out in the transcriptional regulation of key growth and developmental processes.
20484022	Divinyl chlorophyll(ide) a can be converted to monovinyl chlorophyll(ide) a by a divinyl reductase in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	3,8-Divinyl (proto)chlorophyll(ide) a 8-vinyl reductase (DVR) catalyzes the reduction of 8-vinyl group on the tetrapyrrole to an ethyl group, which is indispensable for monovinyl chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis. So far, three 8-vinyl reductase genes (DVR, bciA, and slr1923) have been characterized from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Chlorobium tepidum, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. However, no 8-vinyl reductase gene has yet been identified in monocotyledonous plants. In this study, we isolated a spontaneous mutant, 824ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited a yellow-green leaf phenotype, reduced Chl level, arrested chloroplast development, and retarded growth rate. The phenotype of the 824ys mutant was caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 3. Map-based cloning of this mutant resulted in the identification of a gene (Os03g22780) showing sequence similarity with the Arabidopsis DVR gene (AT5G18660). In the 824ys mutant, nine nucleotides were deleted at residues 952 to 960 in the open reading frame, resulting in a deletion of three amino acid residues in the encoded product. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of Chls indicated the mutant accumulates only divinyl Chl a and b. A recombinant protein encoded by Os03g22780 was expressed in Escherichia coli and found to catalyze the conversion of divinyl chlorophyll(ide) a to monovinyl chlorophyll(ide) a. Therefore, it has been confirmed that Os03g22780, renamed as OsDVR, encodes a functional DVR in rice. Based upon these results, we succeeded to identify an 8-vinyl reductase gene in monocotyledonous plants and, more importantly, confirmed the DVR activity to convert divinyl Chl a to monovinyl Chl a.
20487558	Genomic survey, characterization and expression profile analysis of the peptide transporter family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Peptide transporter (PTR) family whose member can transport di-/tripeptides and nitrate is important for plant growth and development. Although the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome has been sequenced for a few years, a genomic survey, characterization and expression profile analysis of the PTR family in this species has not been reported.

RESULTS: In this study, we report a comprehensive identification, characterization, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of 84 PTR family members in rice (OsPTR) as well as their whole-life expression patterns. Chromosomal distribution and sequence analysis indicate that nearly 70% of OsPTR members are involved in the tandem and segmental duplication events. It suggests that genome duplication might be a major mechanism for expansion of this family. Highly conserved motifs were identified in most of the OsPTR members. Meanwhile, expression profile of OsPTR genes has been analyzed by using Affymetrix rice microarray and real-time PCR in two elite hybrid rice parents, Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Seven genes are found to exhibit either preferential or tissue-specific expression during different development stages of rice. Under phytohormone (NAA, GA3 and KT) and light/dark treatments, 14 and 17 OsPTR genes are differentially expressed respectively. Ka/Ks analysis of the paralogous OsPTR genes indicates that purifying selection plays an important role in function maintenance of this family.

CONCLUSION: These investigations add to our understanding of the importance of OsPTR family members and provide useful reference for selecting candidate genes for functional validation studies of this family in rice.
20507633	Genome-scale analysis and comparison of gene expression profiles in developing and germinated pollen in Oryza sativa.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Pollen development from the microspore involves a series of coordinated cellular events, and the resulting mature pollen has a specialized function to quickly germinate, produce a polar-growth pollen tube derived from the vegetative cell, and deliver two sperm cells into the embryo sac for double fertilization. The gene expression profiles of developing and germinated pollen have been characterised by use of the eudicot model plant Arabidopsis. Rice, one of the most important cereal crops, has been used as an excellent monocot model. A comprehensive analysis of transcriptome profiles of developing and germinated pollen in rice is important to understand the conserved and diverse mechanism underlying pollen development and germination in eudicots and monocots.

RESULTS: We used Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array to comprehensively analyzed the dynamic changes in the transcriptomes of rice pollen at five sequential developmental stages from microspores to germinated pollen. Among the 51,279 transcripts on the array, we found 25,062 pollen-preferential transcripts, among which 2,203 were development stage-enriched. The diversity of transcripts decreased greatly from microspores to mature and germinated pollen, whereas the number of stage-enriched transcripts displayed a "U-type" change, with the lowest at the bicellular pollen stage; and a transition of overrepresented stage-enriched transcript groups associated with different functional categories, which indicates a shift in gene expression program at the bicellular pollen stage. About 54% of the now-annotated rice F-box protein genes were expressed preferentially in pollen. The transcriptome profile of germinated pollen was significantly and positively correlated with that of mature pollen. Analysis of expression profiles and coexpressed features of the pollen-preferential transcripts related to cell cycle, transcription, the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system, phytohormone signalling, the kinase system and defense/stress response revealed five expression patterns, which are compatible with changes in major cellular events during pollen development and germination. A comparison of pollen transcriptomes between rice and Arabidopsis revealed that 56.6% of the rice pollen preferential genes had homologs in Arabidopsis genome, but 63.4% of these homologs were expressed, with a small proportion being expressed preferentially, in Arabidopsis pollen. Rice and Arabidopsis pollen had non-conservative transcription factors each.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that rice pollen expressed a set of reduced but specific transcripts in comparison with vegetative tissues, and the number of stage-enriched transcripts displayed a "U-type" change during pollen development, with the lowest at the bicellular pollen stage. These features are conserved in rice and Arabidopsis. The shift in gene expression program at the bicellular pollen stage may be important to the transition from earlier cell division to later pollen maturity. Pollen at maturity pre-synthesized transcripts needed for germination and early pollen tube growth. The transcription regulation associated with pollen development would have divergence between the two species. Our results also provide novel insights into the molecular program and key components of the regulatory network regulating pollen development and germination.
20385545	Brachypodium distachyon grain: identification and subcellular localization of storage proteins.	2010	J Exp Bot	Seed storage proteins are of great importance in nutrition and in industrial transformation because of their functional properties. Brachypodium distachyon has been proposed as a new model plant to study temperate cereals. The protein composition of Brachypodium grain was investigated by separating the proteins on the basis of their solubility combined with a proteomic approach. Salt-soluble proteins as well as salt-insoluble proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed 284 and 120 spots, respectively. Proteins from the major spots were sequenced by mass spectrometry and identified by searching against a Brachypodium putative protein database. Our analysis detected globulins and prolamins but no albumins. Globulins were represented mainly by the 11S type and their solubility properties corresponded to the glutelin found in rice. An in silico search for storage proteins returned more translated genes than expressed products identified by mass spectrometry, particularly in the case of prolamin type proteins, reflecting a strong expression of globulins at the expense of prolamins. Microscopic examination of endosperm cells revealed scarce small-size starch granules surrounded by protein bodies containing 11S globulins. The presence of protein bodies containing glutelins makes B. distachyon closer to rice or oat than to wheat endosperm.
20305271	Characterization of the reactions of starch branching enzymes from rice endosperm.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	To our knowledge the present paper shows for the first time the kinetic parameters of all the three starch branching enzyme (BE) isozymes, BEI, BEIIa and BEIIb, from rice with both amylopectin and synthetic amylose as glucan substrate. The activities of these BE isozymes with a linear glucan amylose decreased with a decrease in the molar size of amylose, and no activities of BEIIa and BEIIb were found when the degree of polymerization (DP) of amylose was lower than at least 80, whereas BEI had an activity with amylose of a DP higher than approximately 50. Detailed analyses of debranched products from BE reactions revealed the distinct chain length preferences of the individual BE isozymes. BEIIb almost exclusively transferred chains of DP7 and DP6 while BEIIa formed a wide range of short chains of DP6 to around DP15 from outer chains of amylopectin and amylose. On the other hand, BEI formed a variety of short chains and intermediate chains of a DP <or=40 by attacking not only outer chains but also inner chains of branched glucan while BEIIa or BEIIb could only scarcely or could not attack inner chains, respectively. The comprehensive in vitro studies revealed different enzymatic characteristics of the three BE isozymes and give a new insight into the distinct roles of individual BE isozymes in amylopectin biosynthesis in the endosperm. Based on these results, the functional distinction and interaction of BE isozymes during amylopectin biosynthesis in cereal endosperm is discussed.
20145904	Detection of quantitative trait loci controlling pre-harvest sprouting resistance by using backcrossed populations of japonica rice cultivars.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Backcrossed inbred lines (BILs) and a set of reciprocal chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from crosses between japonica rice cultivars Nipponbare and Koshihikari were used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for pre-harvest sprouting resistance. In the BILs, we detected one QTL on chromosome 3 and one QTL on chromosome 12. The QTL on the short arm of chromosome 3 accounted for 45.0% of the phenotypic variance and the Nipponbare allele of the QTL increased germination percentage by 21.3%. In the CSSLs, we detected seven QTLs, which were located on chromosomes 2, 3 (two), 5, 8 and 11 (two). All Nipponbare alleles of the QTLs were associated with an increased rate of germination. The major QTL for pre-harvest sprouting resistance on the short arm of chromosome 3 was localized to a 474-kbp region in the Nipponbare genome by the SSR markers RM14240 and RM14275 by using 11 substitution lines to replace the different short chromosome segments on chromosome 3. This QTL co-localized with the low-temperature germinability gene qLTG3-1. The level of germinability under low temperature strongly correlated with the level of pre-harvest sprouting resistance in the substitution lines. Sequence analyses revealed a novel functional allele of qLTG3-1 in Nipponbare and a loss-of-function allele in Koshihikari. The allelic difference in qLTG3-1 between Nipponbare and Koshihikari is likely to be associated with differences in both pre-harvest sprouting resistance and low-temperature germinability.
20012086	Down-regulation of four putative arabinoxylan feruloyl transferase genes from family PF02458 reduces ester-linked ferulate content in rice cell walls.	2010	Planta	Industrial processes to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic materials are available, but improved efficiency is necessary to make them economically viable. One of the limitations for lignocellulosic conversion to ethanol is the inaccessibility of the cellulose and hemicelluloses within the tight cell wall matrix. Ferulates (FA) can cross-link different arabinoxylan molecules in the cell wall of grasses via diferulate and oligoferulate bridges. This complex cross-linking is thought to be a key factor in limiting the biodegradability of grass cell walls and, therefore, the reduction in FA is an attractive target to improve enzyme accessibility to cellulose and hemicelluloses. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the genes responsible for the incorporation of FA to the cell wall is limited. A bioinformatics prediction based on the gene similarities and higher transcript abundance in grasses relative to dicot species suggested that genes from the pfam family PF02458 may act as arabinoxylan feruloyl transferases. We show here that the FA content in the cell walls and the transcript levels of rice genes Os05g08640, Os06g39470, Os01g09010 and Os06g39390, are both higher in the stems than in the leaves. In addition, an RNA interference (RNAi) construct that simultaneously down-regulates transcript levels of these four genes is associated with a significant reduction in FA of the cell walls from the leaves of the transgenic plants relative to the control (19% reduction, P < 0.0001). Therefore, our experimental results in rice support the bioinformatics prediction that members of family PF02458 are involved in the incorporation of FA into the cell wall in grasses.
20512559	Fine mapping a QTL qCTB7 for cold tolerance at the booting stage on rice chromosome 7 using a near-isogenic line.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Low temperature at the booting stage is a serious abiotic stress in rice, and cold tolerance is a complex trait controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTL). A QTL for cold tolerance at the booting stage in cold-tolerant near-isogenic rice line ZL1929-4 was analyzed. A total of 647 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed across 12 chromosomes were used to survey for polymorphisms between ZL1929-4 and the cold-sensitive japonica cultivar Towada, and nine were polymorphic. Single marker analysis revealed that markers on chromosome 7 were associated with cold tolerance. By interval mapping using an F(2) population from ZL1929-4 x Towada, a QTL for cold tolerance was detected on the long arm of chromosome 7. The QTL explained 9 and 21% of the phenotypic variances in the F(2) and F(3) generations, respectively. Recombinant plants were screened for two flanking markers, RM182 and RM1132, in an F(2) population with 2,810 plants. Two-step substitution mapping suggested that the QTL was located in a 92-kb interval between markers RI02905 and RM21862. This interval was present in BAC clone AP003804. We designated the QTL as qCTB7 (quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance at the booting stage on chromosome 7), and identified 12 putative candidate genes.
19946705	Fine mapping of a gene causing hybrid pollen sterility between Yunnan weedy rice and cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and phylogenetic analysis of Yunnan weedy rice.	2010	Planta	Weedy rice represents an important resource for rice improvement. The F(1) hybrid between the japonica wide compatibility rice cultivar 02428 and a weedy rice accession from Yunnan province (SW China) suffered from pollen sterility. Pollen abortion in the hybrid occurred at the early bicellular pollen stage, as a result of mitotic failure in the microspore, although the tapetum developed normally. Genetic mapping in a BC(1)F(1) population (02428//Yunnan weedy rice (YWR)/02428) showed that a major QTL for hybrid pollen sterility (qPS-1) was present on chromosome 1. qPS-1 was fine-mapped to a 110 kb region known to contain the hybrid pollen sterility gene Sa, making it likely that qPS-1 is either identical to, or allelic with Sa. Interestingly, F(1) hybrid indicated that Dular and IR36 were assumed to carry the sterility-neutral allele, Sa ( n ). Re-sequencing SaM and SaF, the two component genes present at Sa, suggested that variation for IR36 and Dular may be responsible for the loss of male sterility, and the qPS-1 sequence might be derived from wild rice or indica cultivars. A phylogenetic analysis based on microsatellite genotyping suggested that the YWR accession is more closely related to wild rice and indica type cultivars than to japonica types. Thus it is probable that the YWR accession evolved from a spontaneous hybrid between wild rice and an ancient cultivated strain of domesticated rice.
20155410	Genetic and physical fine mapping of Scmv2, a potyvirus resistance gene in maize.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is an important virus pathogen both in European and Chinese maize production, causing serious losses in grain and forage yield in susceptible cultivars. Two major resistance loci confer resistance to SCMV, one located on chromosome 3 (Scmv2) and one on chromosome 6 (Scmv1). We developed a large isogenic mapping population segregating in the Scmv2, but not the Scmv1 region, to minimize genetic variation potentially affecting expression of SCMV resistance. We fine mapped Scmv2 to a region of 0.28 cM, covering a physical distance of 1.3426 Mb, and developed six new polymorphic SSR markers based on publicly available BAC sequences within this region. At present, we still have three recombinants left between Scmv2 and the nearest polymorphic marker on either side of the Scmv2 locus. The region showed synteny to a 1.6 Mb long sequence on chromosome 12 in rice. Analysis of the public B73 BAC library as well as the syntenic rice region did not reveal any similarity to known resistance genes. However, four new candidate genes with a possible involvement in movement of virus were detected.
20364375	Genetic diversity and population structure of a diverse set of rice germplasm for association mapping.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Germplasm diversity is the mainstay for crop improvement and genetic dissection of complex traits. Understanding genetic diversity, population structure, and the level and distribution of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in target populations is of great importance and a prerequisite for association mapping. In this study, 100 genome-wide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess genetic diversity, population structure, and LD of 416 rice accessions including landraces, cultivars and breeding lines collected mostly in China. A model-based population structure analysis divided the rice materials into seven subpopulations. 63% of the SSR pairs in these accessions were in LD, which was mostly due to an overall population structure, since the number of locus pairs in LD was reduced sharply within each subpopulation, with the SSR pairs in LD ranging from 5.9 to 22.9%. Among those SSR pairs showing significant LD, the intrachromosomal LD had an average of 25-50 cM in different subpopulations. Analysis of the phenotypic diversity of 25 traits showed that the population structure accounted for an average of 22.4% of phenotypic variation. An example association mapping for starch quality traits using both the candidate gene mapping and genome-wide mapping strategies based on the estimated population structure was conducted. Candidate gene mapping confirmed that the Wx and starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) genes could be identified as strongly associated with apparent amylose content (AAC) and pasting temperature (PT), respectively. More importantly, we revealed that the Wx gene was also strongly associated with PT. In addition to the major genes, we found five and seven SSRs were associated with AAC and PT, respectively, some of which have not been detected in previous linkage mapping studies. The results suggested that the population may be useful for the genome-wide marker-trait association mapping. This new association population has the potential to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with small effects, which will aid in dissecting complex traits and in exploiting the rich diversity present in rice germplasm.
20383562	Genome-wide analysis of helicase gene family from rice and Arabidopsis: a comparison with yeast and human.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Helicases are motor proteins which can catalyze the unwinding of stable RNA or DNA duplex utilizing mainly ATP as source of energy. In this study we have identified complete sets of helicases from rice and Arabidopsis. The helicase gene family in rice and Arabidopsis contains 115 and 113 genes respectively. These helicases were validated based on their annotations and supported with organization of conserved helicase signature motifs. We have also identified homologs of 64 rice RNA and DNA helicases in Arabidopsis, yeast and human. We explored Arabidopsis oligonucleotide array data to gain functional insights into the transcriptome of helicase family members under ten different stress conditions. Our results revealed that expression of helicase genes is profoundly regulated under various stress conditions. The helicases identified in this study lay a foundation for the in depth characterization of each helicase type.
20194922	Glyoxylate rather than ascorbate is an efficient precursor for oxalate biosynthesis in rice.	2010	J Exp Bot	Oxalate is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. While excess oxalate in food crops is detrimental to animal and human health, it may play various functional roles in plants, particularly for coping with environmental stresses. Understanding its biosynthetic mechanism in plants, therefore, becomes increasingly important both theoretically and practically. However, it is still a matter of debate as to what precursor and pathway are ultimately used for oxalate biosynthesis in plants. In this study, both physiological and molecular approaches were applied to address these questions. First, it was observed that when glycolate or glyoxylate was fed into detached leaves, both organic acids were equally effective in stimulating oxalate accumulation. In addition, the stimulation could be completely inhibited by cysteine, a glyoxylate scavenger that forms cysteine-glyoxylate adducts. To verify the role of glyoxylate further, various transgenic plants were generated, in which several genes involved in glyoxylate metabolism [i.e. SGAT (serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase), GGAT (glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase), HPR (hydroxypyruvate reductase), ICL (isocitrate lyase)], were transcriptionally regulated through RNAi or over-expression. Analyses on these transgenic plants consistently revealed that glyoxylate acted as an efficient precursor for oxalate biosynthesis in rice. Unexpectedly, it was found that oxalate accumulation was not correlated with photorespiration, even though this pathway is known to be a major source of glyoxylate. Further, when GLDH (L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase), a key enzyme gene for ascorbate biosynthesis, was down-regulated, the oxalate abundance remained constant, despite ascorbate having been largely reduced as expected in these transgenic plants. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that glyoxylate rather than ascorbate is an efficient precursor for oxalate biosynthesis, and that oxalate accumulation and regulation do not necessarily depend on photorespiration, possibly due to the occurrence of the anaplerotic reaction that may compensate for glyoxylate formation in rice.
20155303	Identification and characterization of NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 1, a novel gene regulating leaf morphology and plant architecture in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Leaf morphology is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding. We isolated three allelic mutants of NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 1 (nrl1) which showed phenotypes of reduced leaf width and semi-rolled leaves and different degrees of dwarfism. Microscopic analysis indicated that the nrl1-1 mutant had fewer longitudinal veins and smaller adaxial bulliform cells compared with the wild-type. The NRL1 gene was mapped to the chromosome 12 and encodes the cellulose synthase-like protein D4 (OsCslD4). Sequence analyses revealed single base substitutions in the three allelic mutants. Genetic complementation and over-expression of the OsCslD4 gene confirmed the identity of NRL1. The gene was expressed in all tested organs of rice at the heading stage and expression level was higher in vigorously growing organs, such as roots, sheaths and panicles than in elsewhere. In the mutant leaves, however, the expression level was lower than that in the wild-type. We conclude that OsCslD4 encoded by NRL1 plays a critical role in leaf morphogenesis and vegetative development in rice.
20217123	Isolation and identification of cytoskeleton-associated prolamine mRNA binding proteins from developing rice seeds.	2010	Planta	The messenger RNA of the rice seed storage protein prolamine is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes surrounding prolamine protein bodies via a mechanism, which is dependent upon both RNA sorting signals and the actin cytoskeleton. In this study we have used an RNA bait corresponding to the previously characterized 5'CDS prolamine cis-localization sequence for the capture of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from cytoskeleton-enriched fractions of developing rice seed. In comparison to a control RNA, the cis-localization RNA bait sequence led to the capture of a much larger number of proteins, 18 of which have been identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Western blots demonstrate that several of the candidate proteins analyzed to date show good to excellent specificity for binding to cis-localization sequences over the control RNA bait. Temporal expression studies showed that steady state protein levels for one RNA binding protein, RBP-A, paralleled prolamine gene expression. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that RBP-A is bound to prolamine and glutelin RNAs in vivo, supporting a direct role in storage protein gene expression. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, RBP-A was found to be distributed to multiple compartments in the cell. In addition to the nucleus, RBP-A co-localizes with microtubules and is associated with cortical ER membranes. Collectively, these results indicate that employing a combination of in vitro binding and in vivo binding and localization studies is a valid strategy for the identification of putative prolamine mRNA binding proteins, such as RBP-A, which play a role in controlling expression of storage protein mRNAs in the cytoplasm.
20424856	Isolation of a novel cell wall architecture mutant of rice with defective Arabidopsis COBL4 ortholog BC1 required for regulated deposition of secondary cell wall components.	2010	Planta	The plant secondary cell wall is a highly ordered structure composed of various polysaccharides, phenolic components and proteins. Its coordinated regulation of a number of complex metabolic pathways and assembly has not been resolved. To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate secondary cell wall synthesis, we isolated a novel rice mutant, cell wall architecture1 (cwa1), that exhibits an irregular thickening pattern in the secondary cell wall of sclerenchyma, as well as culm brittleness and reduced cellulose content in mature internodes. Light and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cwa1 mutant plant has regions of local aggregation in the secondary cell walls of the cortical fibers in its internodes, showing uneven thickness. Ultraviolet microscopic observation indicated that localization of cell wall phenolic components was perturbed and that these components abundantly deposited at the aggregated cell wall regions in sclerenchyma. Therefore, regulation of deposition and assembly of secondary cell wall materials, i.e. phenolic components, appear to be disturbed by mutation of the cwa1 gene. Genetic analysis showed that cwa1 is allelic to brittle culm1 (bc1), which encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored COBRA-like protein specifically in plants. BC1 is known as a regulator that controls the culm mechanical strength and cellulose content in the secondary cell walls of sclerenchyma, but the precise function of BC1 has not been resolved. Our results suggest that CWA1/BC1 has an essential role in assembling cell wall constituents at their appropriate sites, thereby enabling synthesis of solid and flexible internodes in rice.
20164144	Mechanisms of ozone tolerance in rice: characterization of two QTLs affecting leaf bronzing by gene expression profiling and biochemical analyses.	2010	J Exp Bot	High surface ozone concentration is increasingly being recognized as a factor that negatively affects crop yields in Asia. However, little progress has been made in developing ozone-tolerant genotypes of rice-Asia's major staple crop. This study aimed to identify possible tolerance mechanisms by characterizing two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that were previously shown to influence visible leaf symptoms under ozone exposure (120 nl l(-1), 7 h d(-1), 13 d). Two chromosome segment substitution lines (SL15 and SL41) that carried introgressions of the QTLs OzT3 and OzT9, respectively, were exposed to ozone at 120 nl l(-1) along with their parent Nipponbare. In accordance with the expected QTL effect, SL15 showed stronger visible symptoms of ozone damage than Nipponbare, whereas SL41 had fewer symptoms. Gene expression profiling by microarray hybridization yielded 470 probes that were differentially expressed in SL15 and 314 in SL41. Potential tolerance mechanisms were evaluated by investigating changes in gene expression in three general categories. (i) Processes involved in programmed cell death, in which a number of genes related to ethylene or jasmonic acid metabolism or general disease resistance were identified that were differentially regulated in one of the substitution lines. (ii) Biosynthesis of antioxidants. Testing this hypothesis did not reveal any genes differentially regulated between genotypes, and it was thus rejected. (iii) Turnover of antioxidants and enzymatic detoxification of radical oxygen species (ROS), in which a number of differentially regulated genes were also identified. Genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (catalase and peroxidases) tended to be more strongly expressed in SL15. A potential tolerance gene which encodes a putative ascorbate oxidase was identified within the QTL introgression in SL41. This gene showed consistently lower expression in SL41 under ozone exposure across different points in time within independent experiments. Its expression may be involved in mechanisms leading to enhanced ascorbic acid status in SL41 under ozone exposure, and may be linked to a higher concentration of total apoplastic ascorbic acid in SL41 that was observed in an independent experiment.
20091293	Molecular mapping and candidate gene identification of the Rf2 gene for pollen fertility restoration in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench].	2010	Theor Appl Genet	The A1 cytoplasmic-nuclear male sterility system in sorghum is used almost exclusively for the production of commercial hybrid seed and thus, the dominant genes that restore male fertility in F(1) hybrids are of critical importance to commercial seed production. The genetics of fertility restoration in sorghum can appear complex, being controlled by at least two major genes with additional modifiers and additional gene-environment interaction. To elucidate the molecular processes controlling fertility restoration and to develop a marker screening system for this important trait, two sorghum recombinant inbred line populations were created by crossing a restorer and a non-restoring inbred line, with fertility phenotypes evaluated in hybrid combination with three unique cytoplasmic male sterile lines. In both populations, a single major gene segregated for restoration which was localized to chromosome SBI-02 at approximately 0.5 cM from microsatellite marker, Xtxp304. In the two populations we observed that approximately 85 and 87% of the phenotypic variation in seed set was associated with the major Rf gene on SBI-02. Some evidence for modifier genes was also observed since a continuum of partial restored fertility was exhibited by lines in both RIL populations. With the prior report (Klein et al. in Theor Appl Genet 111:994-1012, 2005) of the cloning of the major fertility restoration gene Rf1 in sorghum, the major fertility restorer locus identified in this study was designated Rf2. A fine-mapping population was used to resolve the Rf2 locus to a 236,219-bp region of chromosome SBI-02, which spanned ~31 predicted open reading frames including a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene family member. The PPR gene displayed high homology with rice Rf1. Progress towards the development of a marker-assisted screen for fertility restoration is discussed.
20473653	QTL mapping of protein content in rice using single chromosome segment substitution lines.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Protein content (PC) is an important component of rice nutritional quality. In order to better understand the genetic basis of this trait and increase related breeding efficiency, 21 single chromosome segment substitution (SCSS) lines grown in four sites over two growing seasons (regarded as eight environments) were used to associate PC with particular chromosome segments. Segments from 15 chromosomes were found to contain quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for PC in at least one environment. These included segments from chromosome 3 and 8, in which QTLs for PC had not previously been identified. The segment of chromosome 8 in CSSL-48 had the largest positive effect across all environments. The interaction between substitution and environment was highly significant. Some substitutions had large effects in one environment, but no effect in another (i.e. CSSL-08 and CSSL-17), while some substitutions significantly increased PC in one environment but decreased it in another (i.e. CSSL-41 and CSSL-43). By biplot and clustering analysis, the eight environments were grouped into two contrasting environment types, that is, Hainan and Jiangsu. The segment of chromosome 8 in CSSL-48 had PC-enhancing QTLs in both of the environment types. The segments in CSSL-34 had QTLs which increase PC in the Jiangsu environment but have no effect in the Hainan environment. For enhancing PC, CSSL-48 could be explored in breeding for wide adaptation across all environments, while CSSL-12, CSSL-14, CSSL-17, CSSL-41 and CSSL-43, and that in CSSL-34 could be explored in breeding for specific adaptation to the Hainan and Jiangsu environments, respectively. Near isogenic lines are under development to validate the QTLs with large effects in a range of genetic backgrounds relevant to Jiangsu and Hainan breeding programs. Secondary mapping populations are also being developed for further localising the responsible QTLs in CSSL-14, CSSL-34 and CSSL-48.
20369251	Rice BRITTLE CULM 3 (BC3) encodes a classical dynamin OsDRP2B essential for proper secondary cell wall synthesis.	2010	Planta	"Brittle culm" mutants found in Gramineae crops are suitable materials to study the mechanism of secondary cell wall formation. Through positional cloning, we have identified a gene responsible for the brittle culm phenotype in rice, brittle culm 3 (bc3). BC3 encodes a member of the classical dynamin protein family, a family known to function widely in membrane dynamics. The bc3 mutation resulted in reductions of 28-36% in cellulose contents in culms, leaves, and roots, while other cell wall components remained unaffected. Reductions of cell wall thickness and birefringence were observed in both fiber (sclerenchyma) and parenchymal cells, together with blurring of the wall's layered structures. From promoter-GUS analyses, it was suggested that BC3 expression is directly correlated with active secondary cell wall synthesis. These results suggest that BC3 is tightly involved in the synthesis of cellulose and is essential for proper secondary cell wall construction.
20512651	Rice fruit development is associated with an increased IAA content in pollinated ovaries.	2010	Planta	To analyze fruit set and early fruit (caryopsis) development in rice, we established an in vitro spikelet culture system. The ovary of cultured pollinated spikelets grew rapidly and developed into fruits with an embryo and endosperm. When unpollinated spikelets were cultured on a medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, parthenocarpic fruits lacking an embryo and endosperm developed. The number and size of the cells in the pericarp of parthenocarpic fruits were almost identical to those of fruits induced by pollination, and degeneration of nucellus tissue was observed in both pollinated and parthenocarpic fruits. These results suggested that ovary growth was induced through increased auxin content in the spikelets. Quantitative measurement of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content in the spikelets indicated that the IAA level increased after pollination. Further analysis of IAA contents in the ovary and rachilla-pedicel of cultured spikelets suggested that fruit development is associated with IAA synthesis in the ovary following pollination/fertilization and subsequent transport of IAA from the ovary to the rachilla-pedicel. Partial or complete removal of the rachilla and/or pedicel prior to spikelet culture greatly inhibited fruit development. These results indicated that the rachilla and pedicel are essential for rice fruit development. AUX/IAA and ARF genes that might be involved in rice fruit development were identified through transcriptome analysis.
20396901	The AtTudor2, a protein with SN-Tudor domains, is involved in control of seed germination in Arabidopsis.	2010	Planta	The 4SN-Tudor domain protein is an almost ubiquitous eukaryotic protein with four Staphylococcal nuclease domains at the N terminus and a Tudor domain towards the C terminus. It has been found that Tudor-SN protein has multiple roles in governing gene expression during cell growth and development in animals. In plant, although Tudor-SN orthologs have been found in rice, pea and Arabidopsis, and are associated with cytoskeleton, their roles in growth and development are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the function of Arabidopsis Tudor-SN protein, AtTudor. Our results indicated that the expression of AtTudor2 in seeds was evidently higher than in other tissues. Furthermore, we found that the expression of a key enzyme for GA biosynthesis, AtGA20ox3, was downregulated obviously in AtTudor2 T-DNA insertion mutant and AtTudor1/AtTudor2 RNAi transgenic lines. Together, our results suggest that AtTudor2 is involved in GA biosynthesis and seed germination of Arabidopsis.
18944325	Localizing the Bacterial Blight Resistance Gene, Xa22(t), to a 100-Kilobase Bacterial Artificial Chromosome.	2003	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT The rice bacterial blight resistance gene, Xa22(t), provides resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae isolates. Here, we localize the gene to a small 100-kb fragment of chromosome 11 by a combination of genetic recombination analysis and physical mapping. Mapping was done with two F(2) populations from the cross between Zhachanglong and Zhenzhuai. The first population consisted of 248 random individuals and 404 highly susceptible individuals selected from an F(2) population of more than 2,000 individuals and was used to construct a linkage map around the Xa22(t) locus. For the second F(2) population, 7,680 plants were examined with simple sequence repeat markers flanking the Xa22(t) locus to identify recombinants useful for fine-genetic mapping. Two large-insert bacterial artificial chromasome (BAC) libraries (from cvs. Teqing and Minghui63) were screened with a marker (R1506) which cosegregated perfectly with Xa22(t) in the first population. Restriction mapping of the resulting BAC clones enabled a physical map of the area to be constructed, and subclones from the BAC clones provided additional restriction fragment length polymorphism probes which could be placed on the fine-structure genetic map using the recombinants from the second mapping population. The Xa22(t) locus was mapped to a approximately 100-kb interval delimited by the R1506 marker and a subclone from the M3H8 BAC clone.
21048083	Rice pollen hybrid incompatibility caused by reciprocal gene loss of duplicated genes.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Genetic incompatibility is a barrier contributing to species isolation and is caused by genetic interactions. We made a whole genome survey of two-way interacting loci acting within the gametophyte or zygote using independence tests of marker segregations in an F(2) population from an intersubspecific cross between O. sativa subspecies indica and japonica. We detected only one reproducible interaction, and identified paralogous hybrid incompatibility genes, DOPPELGANGER1 (DPL1) and DOPPELGANGER2 (DPL2), by positional cloning. Independent disruptions of DPL1 and DPL2 occurred in indica and japonica, respectively. DPLs encode highly conserved, plant-specific small proteins (∼10 kDa) and are highly expressed in mature anther. Pollen carrying two defective DPL alleles became nonfunctional and did not germinate, suggesting an essential role for DPLs in pollen germination. Although rice has many duplicated genes resulting from ancient whole genome duplication, the origin of this gene duplication was in recent small-scale gene duplication, occurring after Oryza-Brachypodium differentiation. Comparative analyses suggested the geographic and phylogenetic distribution of these two defective alleles, showing that loss-of-function mutations of DPL1 genes emerged multiple times in indica and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon, and that the DPL2 gene defect is specific to japonica cultivars.
20872166	Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice.	2011	Biotechnol Lett	The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase gene (ACO1) was upregulated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) phyAphyBphyC mutants lacking any phytochrome and containing the GCC box element, a binding site for rice ethylene-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsEREBP1), in its promoter region. Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants. However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants. This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation.
20419467	OsZIP5 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Zinc is essential for normal plant growth and development. To understand its transport in rice, we characterized OsZIP5, which is inducible under Zn deficiency. OsZIP5 complemented the growth defect of a yeast Zn-uptake mutant, indicating that OsZIP5 is a Zn transporter. The OsZIP5-GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Transgenic plants overexpressing the gene grew less well. Overexpression of the gene decreased the Zn concentration in shoots, but caused it to rise in the roots. Knockout plants showed no visible phenotypic changes under either normal or deficient conditions. However, they were tolerant to excess Zn and contained less Zn. In contrast, overexpressing transgenics were sensitive to excess Zn. These results indicate that OsZIP5 plays a role in Zn distribution within rice.
20478970	Strigolactone regulation of shoot branching in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum).	2010	J Exp Bot	Previous studies of highly branched mutants in pea (rms1-rms5), Arabidopsis thaliana (max1-max4), petunia (dad1-dad3), and rice (d3, d10, htd1/d17, d14, d27) identified strigolactones or their derivates (SLs), as shoot branching inhibitors. This recent discovery offers the possibility of using SLs to regulate branching commercially, for example, in chrysanthemum, an important cut flower crop. To investigate this option, SL physiology and molecular biology were studied in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum), focusing on the CCD8/MAX4/DAD1/RMS1/D10 gene. Our results suggest that, as has been proposed for Arabidopsis, the ability of SLs to inhibit bud activity depends on the presence of a competing auxin source. The chrysanthemum SL biosynthesis gene, CCD8 was cloned, and found to be regulated in a similar, but not identical way to known CCD8s. Expression analyses revealed that DgCCD8 is predominantly expressed in roots and stems, and is up-regulated by exogenous auxin. Exogenous SL can down-regulate DgCCD8 expression, but this effect can be overridden by apical auxin application. This study provides evidence that SLs are promising candidates to alter the shoot branching habit of chrysanthemum.
20498060	Parent-independent genotyping for constructing an ultrahigh-density linkage map based on population sequencing.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bar-coded multiplexed sequencing approaches based on new-generation sequencing technologies provide capacity to sequence a mapping population in a single sequencing run. However, such approaches usually generate low-coverage and error-prone sequences for each line in a population. Thus, it is a significant challenge to genotype individual lines in a population for linkage map construction based on low-coverage sequences without the availability of high-quality genotype data of the parental lines. In this paper, we report a method for constructing ultrahigh-density linkage maps composed of high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on low-coverage sequences of recombinant inbred lines. First, all potential SNPs were identified to obtain drafts of parental genotypes using a maximum parsimonious inference of recombination, making maximum use of SNP information found in the entire population. Second, high-quality SNPs were identified by filtering out low-quality ones by permutations involving resampling of windows of SNPs followed by Bayesian inference. Third, lines in the mapping population were genotyped using the high-quality SNPs assisted by a hidden Markov model. With 0.05x genome sequence per line, an ultrahigh-density linkage map composed of bins of high-quality SNPs using 238 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two rice varieties was constructed. Using this map, a quantitative trait locus for grain width (GW5) was localized to its presumed genomic region in a bin of 200 kb, confirming the accuracy and quality of the map. This method is generally applicable in genetic map construction with low-coverage sequence data.
20530196	Interference with oxidative phosphorylation enhances anoxic expression of rice alpha-amylase genes through abolishing sugar regulation.	2010	J Exp Bot	Rice has the unique ability to express alpha-amylase under anoxic conditions, a feature that is critical for successful anaerobic germination and growth. Previously, anaerobic conditions were shown to up-regulate the expression of Amy3 subfamily genes (Amy3B/C, 3D, and 3E) in rice embryos. These genes are known to be feedback regulated by the hydrolytic products of starchy endosperm such as the simple sugar glucose. It was found that oxygen deficiency interferes with the repression of Amy3D gene expression imposed by low concentrations of glucose but not with that imposed by higher amounts. This differential anoxic de-repression depending on sugar concentration suggests the presence of two distinct pathways for sugar regulation of Amy3D gene expression. Anoxic de-repression can be mimicked by treating rice embryos with inhibitors of ATP synthesis during respiration. Other sugar-regulated rice alpha-amylase genes, Amy3B/C and 3E, behave similarly to Amy3D. Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation. SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box). Taken together, these results suggest that prevention of oxidative phosphorylation by oxygen deficiency interferes with the sugar repression of Amy3 subfamily gene expression, leading to their enhanced expression in rice embryos during anaerobic germination.
20542917	Numbers of genes in the NBS and RLK families vary by more than four-fold within a plant species and are regulated by multiple factors.	2010	Nucleic Acids Res	Many genes exist in the form of families; however, little is known about their size variation, evolution and biology. Here, we present the size variation and evolution of the nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding gene family and receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family in Oryza, Glycine and Gossypium. The sizes of both families vary by numeral fold, not only among species, surprisingly, also within a species. The size variations of the gene families are shown to correlate with each other, indicating their interactions, and driven by natural selection, artificial selection and genome size variation, but likely not by polyploidization. The numbers of genes in the families in a polyploid species are similar to those of one of its diploid donors, suggesting that polyploidization plays little roles in the expansion of the gene families and that organisms tend not to maintain their 'surplus' genes in the course of evolution. Furthermore, it is found that the size variations of both gene families are associated with organisms' phylogeny, suggesting their roles in speciation and evolution. Since both selection and speciation act on organism's morphological, physiological and biological variation, our results indicate that the variation of gene family size provides a source of genetic variation and evolution.
20543848	A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice.	2010	Nat Genet	The critical day length triggering photoperiodic flowering is set as an acute, accurate threshold in many short-day plants, including rice. Here, we show that, unlike the Arabidopsis florigen gene FT, the rice florigen gene Hd3a (Heading date 3a) is toggled by only a 30-min day-length reduction. Hd3a expression is induced by Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) expression when blue light coincides with the morning phase set by OsGIGANTEA(OsGI)-dependent circadian clocks. Ehd1 expression is repressed by both night breaks under short-day conditions and morning light signals under long-day conditions. Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning. Thus, two distinct gating mechanisms--of the floral promoter Ehd1 and the floral repressor Ghd7--could enable manipulation of slight differences in day length to control Hd3a transcription with a critical day-length threshold.
20559817	Targeted mapping of Cdu1, a major locus regulating grain cadmium concentration in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum).	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Some durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) cultivars have the genetic propensity to accumulate cadmium (Cd) in the grain. A major gene controlling grain Cd concentration designated as Cdu1 has been reported on 5B, but the genetic factor(s) conferring the low Cd phenotype are currently unknown. The objectives of this study were to saturate the chromosomal region harboring Cdu1 with newly developed PCR-based markers and to investigate the colinearity of this wheat chromosomal region with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon genomes. Genetic mapping of markers linked to Cdu1 in a population of recombinant inbred substitution lines revealed that the gene(s) associated with variation in Cd concentration resides in wheat bin 5BL9 between fraction breakpoints 0.76 and 0.79. Genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of grain Cd concentration was performed in 155 doubled haploid lines from the cross W9262-260D3 (low Cd) by Kofa (high Cd) revealed two expressed sequence tag markers (ESMs) and one sequence tagged site (STS) marker that co-segregated with Cdu1 and explained >80% of the phenotypic variation in grain Cd concentration. A second, minor QTL for grain Cd concentration was also identified on 5B, 67 cM proximal to Cdu1. The Cdu1 interval spans 286 kbp of rice chromosome 3 and 282 kbp of Brachypodium chromosome 1. The markers and rice and Brachypodium colinearity described here represent tools that will assist in the positional cloning of Cdu1 and can be used to select for low Cd accumulation in durum wheat breeding programs targeting this trait. The isolation of Cdu1 will further our knowledge of Cd accumulation in cereals as well as metal accumulation in general.
20563548	Evaluation of seed storage-protein gene 5' untranslated regions in enhancing gene expression in transgenic rice seed.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	5' untranslated regions (UTRs) are important sequence elements that modulate the expression of genes. Using the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by the GluC promoter for the rice-seed storage-protein glutelin, we evaluated the potential of the 5'-UTRs of six seed storage-protein genes in enhancing the expression levels of the foreign gene in stable transgenic rice lines. All of the 5'-UTRs significantly enhanced the expression level of the GluC promoter without altering its expression pattern. The 5'-UTRs of Glb-1 and GluA-1 increased the expression of GUS by about 3.36- and 3.11-fold, respectively. The two 5'-UTRs downstream of the Glb-1, OsAct2 and CMV35S promoters also increased GUS expression level in stable transgenic rice lines or in transient expression protoplasts. Therefore, the enhancements were independent of the promoter sequence. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the increase in protein production was not accompanied by alteration in mRNA levels, which suggests that the enhancements were due to increasing the translational efficiencies of the mRNA. The 5'-UTRs of Glb-1 and GluA-1, when combined with strong promoters, might be ideal candidates for high production of recombinant proteins in rice seeds.
20565843	Genome-wide and molecular evolution analyses of the phospholipase D gene family in Poplar and Grape.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Phospholipase D (PLD) family plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes in plants, including abscisic acid signaling, programmed cell death, root hair patterning, root growth, freezing tolerance and other stress responses. PLD genes constitute an important gene family in higher plants. However, until now our knowledge concerning the PLD gene family members and their evolutionary relationship in woody plants such as Poplar and Grape has been limited.

RESULTS: In this study, we have provided a genome-wide analysis of the PLD gene family in Poplar and Grape. Eighteen and eleven members of the PLD gene family were identified in Poplar and Grape respectively. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the PLD gene family can be divided into 6 subgroups: alpha, beta/gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and phi, and that the 6 PLD subgroups originated from 4 original ancestors through a series of gene duplications. Interestingly, the majority of the PLD genes from both Poplar (76.5%, 13/17) and Grape (90.9%, 10/11) clustered closely together in the phylogenetic tree to the extent that their evolutionary relationship appears more tightly linked to each other, at least in terms of the PLD gene family, than it does to either Arabidopsis or rice. Five pairs of duplicated PLD genes were identified in Poplar, more than those in Grape, suggesting that frequent gene duplications occurred after these species diverged, resulting in a rapid expansion of the PLD gene family in Poplar. The majority of the gene duplications in Poplar were caused by segmental duplication and were distinct from those in Arabidopsis, rice and Grape. Additionally, the gene duplications in Poplar were estimated to have occurred from 11.31 to 13.76 million years ago, which are later than those that occurred in the other three plant species. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that positive selection contributed to the evolution of the PXPH- and SP-PLDs, whereas purifying selection has driven the evolution of C2-PLDs that contain a C2 domain in their N-terminal. Analyses have shown that the C2-PLDs generally contain 23 motifs, more than 17 motifs in PXPH-PLDs that contain PX and PH domains in N-terminal. Among these identified motifs, eight, (6, 8, 5, 4, 3, 14, 1 and 19) were shared by both the C2- and PXPH-PLD subfamilies, implying that they may be necessary for PLD function. Five of these shared motifs are located in the central region of the proteins, thus strongly suggesting that this region containing a HKD domain (named after three conserved H, K and D residues) plays a key role in the lipase activity of the PLDs.

CONCLUSION: As a first step towards genome wide analyses of the PLD genes in woody plants, our results provide valuable information for increasing our understanding of the function and evolution of the PLD gene family in higher plants.
20570296	Identification of a beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing tuberonic acid glucoside in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Phytochemistry	Tuberonic acid (TA) and its glucoside (TAG) have been isolated from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) leaflets and shown to exhibit tuber-inducing properties. These compounds were reported to be biosynthesized from jasmonic acid (JA) by hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation, and to be contained in various plant species. Here we describe the in vivo hydrolytic activity of TAG in rice. In this study, the TA resulting from TAG was not converted into JA. Tuberonic acid glucoside (TAG)-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase, designated OsTAGG1, was purified from rice by six purification steps with an approximately 4300-fold purification. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band on native PAGE, but as two bands with molecular masses of 42 and 26 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Results from N-terminal sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting of both polypeptides suggested that both bands were derived from a single polypeptide, which is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 1. In the native enzyme, the K(m) and V(max) values of TAG were 31.7 microM and 0.25 microkatal/mg protein, OsTAGG1 preferentially hydrolyzed TAG and methyl TAG. Here we report that OsTAGG1 is a specific beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing TAG, which releases the physiologically active TA.
20576316	The ABRE-binding bZIP transcription factor OsABF2 is a positive regulator of abiotic stress and ABA signaling in rice.	2010	J Plant Physiol	Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone involved in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The group A bZIP transcription factors play important roles in the ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis but little is known about their functions in rice. In our current study, we have isolated and characterized a group A bZIP transcription factor in rice, OsABF2 (Oryza sativa ABA-responsive element binding factor 2). It was found to be expressed in various tissues in rice and induced by different types of abiotic stress treatments such as drought, salinity, cold, oxidative stress, and ABA. Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using a GFP fusion vector indicated that OsABF2 is a nuclear protein. In yeast experiments, OsABF2 was shown to bind to ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) and its N-terminal region found to be necessary to transactivate a downstream reporter gene. A homozygous T-DNA insertional mutant of OsABF2 is more sensitive to salinity, drought, and oxidative stress compared with wild type plants. In addition, this Osabf2 mutant showed a significantly decreased sensitivity to high levels of ABA at germination and post-germination. Collectively, our present results indicate that OsABF2 functions as a transcriptional regulator that modulates the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes through an ABA-dependent pathway.
20580124	Identification of putative target genes to manipulate Fe and Zn concentrations in rice grains.	2010	J Plant Physiol	Rice is the staple food of half of the world's population; however, it is a poor source of essential micronutrients such as Fe and Zn. Since flag leaves are one of the sources of remobilized metals for developing seeds, the identification of the molecular players that might contribute to the process of metal transport from flag leaves to the seeds may be useful for biofortification purposes. We analyzed the expression of 25 metal-related genes from rice, including rice homologues for YSLs, NRAMPs, ZIPs, IRT1, VIT1 (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NASs, FROs and NAC5 (involved in metal homeostasis) in flag leaves of eight rice cultivars (showing contrasting levels of seed Fe and Zn) during panicle emergence (R3) and grain filling stage (R5). The expression level of nine of these genes (OsYSL6, OsYSL8, OsYSL14, OsNRAMP1, OsNRAMP7, OsNRAMP8, OsNAS1, OsFRO1 and OsNAC5) in flag leaves exhibited significant correlations with Fe and/or Zn concentrations in the seeds. In this way, our study has provided a short list of putative target genes to manipulate Fe and Zn concentrations in rice grains.
20589366	Identification of the blast resistance gene Pit in rice cultivars using functional markers.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	DNA markers that allow for identification of resistance genes in rice germplasm have a great advantage in resistance breeding because they can assess the existence of the genes without laborious inoculation tests. Functional markers (FMs), which are designed from functional polymorphisms within the sequence of genes, are unaffected by nonfunctional allelic variation and make it possible to identify an individual gene. We previously showed that the resistance function of the rice blast resistance gene Pit in a resistant cultivar, K59, was mainly acquired by up-regulated promoter activity through the insertion of a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon upstream of Pit. Here, we developed PCR-based DNA markers derived from the LTR-retrotransposon sequence and used these markers to screen worldwide accessions of rice germplasm. We identified 5 cultivars with the LTR-retrotransposon insertion out of 68 rice accessions. The sequence and expression pattern of Pit in the five cultivars were the same as those in K59 and all showed Pit-mediated blast resistance. The results suggest that the functional Pit identified using the markers was derived from a common progenitor. Additionally, comparison of the Pit coding sequences between K59 and susceptible cultivars revealed that one nucleotide polymorphism, which caused an amino acid substitution, offered another target for a FM. These results indicate that our DNA markers should enhance prediction of Pit function and be applicable to a range of rice varieties/landraces cultivated in various regions worldwide and belonging to the temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and indica groups.
20591144	Delineating the structural, functional and evolutionary relationships of sucrose phosphate synthase gene family II in wheat and related grasses.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is an important component of the plant sucrose biosynthesis pathway. In the monocotyledonous Poaceae, five SPS genes have been identified. Here we present a detailed analysis of the wheat SPSII family in wheat. A set of homoeologue-specific primers was developed in order to permit both the detection of sequence variation, and the dissection of the individual contribution of each homoeologue to the global expression of SPSII.

RESULTS: The expression in bread wheat over the course of development of various sucrose biosynthesis genes monitored on an Affymetrix array showed that the SPS genes were regulated over time and space. SPSII homoeologue-specific assays were used to show that the three homoeologues contributed differentially to the global expression of SPSII. Genetic mapping placed the set of homoeoloci on the short arms of the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. A resequencing of the A and B genome copies allowed the detection of four haplotypes at each locus. The 3B copy includes an unspliced intron. A comparison of the sequences of the wheat SPSII orthologues present in the diploid progenitors einkorn, goatgrass and Triticum speltoides, as well as in the more distantly related species barley, rice, sorghum and purple false brome demonstrated that intronic sequence was less well conserved than exonic. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of SPSII gene showed that false purple brome was more similar to Triticeae than to rice. Wheat - rice synteny was found to be perturbed at the SPS region.

CONCLUSION: The homoeologue-specific assays will be suitable to derive associations between SPS functionality and key phenotypic traits. The amplicon sequences derived from the homoeologue-specific primers are informative regarding the evolution of SPSII in a polyploid context.
20602115	Combining QTL mapping and transcriptome profiling of bulked RILs for identification of functional polymorphism for salt tolerance genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	Identification of genes for quantitative traits is difficult using any single approach due to complex inheritance of the traits and limited resolving power of the individual techniques. Here a combination of genetic mapping and bulked transcriptome profiling was used to narrow down the number of differentially expressed salt-responsive genes in rice in order to identify functional polymorphism of genes underlying the quantitative trait loci (QTL). A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from cross between salt-tolerant variety CSR 27 and salt-sensitive variety MI 48 was used to map QTL for salt ion concentrations in different tissues and salt stress susceptibility index (SSI) for spikelet fertility, grain weight, and grain yield. Eight significant QTL intervals were mapped on chromosomes 1, 8, and 12 for the salt ion concentrations and a QTL controlling SSI for spikelet fertility was co-located in one of these intervals on chromosome 8. However, there were total 2,681 genes in these QTL intervals, making it difficult to pinpoint the genes responsible for the functional differences for the traits. Similarly, transcriptome profiling of the seedlings of tolerant and sensitive parents grown under control and salt-stress conditions showed 798 and 2,407 differentially expressed gene probes, respectively. By analyzing pools of RNA extracted from ten each of extremely tolerant and extremely sensitive RILs to normalize the background noise, the number of differentially expressed genes under salt stress was drastically reduced to 30 only. Two of these genes, an integral transmembrane protein DUF6 and a cation chloride cotransporter, were not only co-located in the QTL intervals but also showed the expected distortion of allele frequencies in the extreme tolerant and sensitive RILs, and therefore are suitable for future validation studies and development of functional markers for salt tolerance in rice to facilitate marker-assisted breeding.
20607290	Multiple introgression events surrounding the Hd1 flowering-time gene in cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	Flowering time is a major determinant for the local adaptation of crops. Hd1 is a key flowering-time gene in rice and is orthologous to the Arabidopsis CONSTANS gene. To elucidate the role of Hd1 in selection, we examined the Hd1 alleles of 60 landraces of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) originating from all regions of Asia, which comprised three cultivar groups, indica, japonica, and aus. The identified alleles were classified into four allele groups. The functional Hd1 alleles in allele groups I and II corresponded to indica and japonica, respectively. Non-functional alleles in these groups were not clearly associated with cultivar groups or locations. Allele groups III and IV corresponded to the aus cultivar group. The ancestry of each cultivar group was identified by the coalescent approach for Hd1 molecular evolution using the haplotype patterns of 14 regions over the 1.1 Mb chromosomal region surrounding Hd1 and the pSINE patterns of two loci, 1.4 and 4.4 Mb apart from Hd1. The haplotype patterns clearly revealed that Hd1 allele migration was caused by multiple and complex introgression events between cultivar groups. The Hd1 haplotypes among dozens of accessions of the wild species O. rufipogon were strongly divergent and only two of the haplotype clusters in O. rufipogon were closely related to those in cultivated rice. This strongly suggested that multiple introgression events have played an important role in the shaping and diversification of adaptation in addition to primary selection steps at the beginning of domestication.
20610409	Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements of Stowaway are active in potato.	2010	Genetics	Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are dispersed in large numbers within the genomes of eukaryotes although almost all are thought to be inactive. Plants have two major groups of such MITEs: Tourist and Stowaway. Mobile MITEs have been reported previously in rice but no active MITEs have been found in dicotyledons. Here, we provide evidence that Stowaway MITEs can be mobilized in the potato and that one of them causes a change of tuber skin color as an obvious phenotypic variation. In an original red-skinned potato clone, the gene encoding for a flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase, which is involved in purple anthocyanin synthesis, has been inactivated by the insertion of a Stowaway MITE named dTstu1 within the first exon. However, dTstu1 is absent from this gene in a purple somaclonal variant that was obtained as a regenerated plant from a protoplast culture of the red-skinned potato. The color change was attributed to reversion of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase function by removal of dTstu1 from the gene. In this purple variant another specific transposition event has occurred involving a MITE closely related to dTstu1. Instead of being fossil elements, Stowaway MITEs, therefore, still have the ability to become active under particular conditions as represented by tissue culturing.
20610705	OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	Synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including of the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small, abundant lipid-binding proteins that have the ability to exchange lipids between membranes in vitro. However, their biological role in male reproductive development remains less understood. Here, we report the crucial role of OsC6 in regulating postmeiotic anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots. OsC6 expression is mainly detectable in tapetal cells and weakly in microspores from stage 9 to stage 11 of anther development. Immunological assays indicated that OsC6 is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, the extracellular space between the tapetum and middle layer, and the anther locule and anther cuticle. Biochemical assays indicated that recombinant OsC6 has lipid binding activity. Moreover, plants in which OsC6 was silenced had defective development of orbicules (i.e. Ubisch bodies) and pollen exine and had reduced pollen fertility. Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR). Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the tdr tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the TDR promoter compared with the tdr mutant. These data suggest that OsC6 plays a crucial role in the development of lipidic orbicules and pollen exine during anther development in rice.
20626650	Rice structural variation: a comparative analysis of structural variation between rice and three of its closest relatives in the genus Oryza.	2010	Plant J	Rapid progress in comparative genomics among the grasses has revealed similar gene content and order despite exceptional differences in chromosome size and number. Large- and small-scale genomic variations are of particular interest, especially among cultivated and wild species, as they encode rapidly evolving features that may be important in adaptation to particular environments. We present a genome-wide study of intermediate-sized structural variation (SV) among rice (Oryza sativa) and three of its closest relatives in the genus Oryza (Oryza nivara, Oryza rufipogon and Oryza glaberrima). We computationally identified regional expansions, contractions and inversions in the Oryza species genomes relative to O. sativa by combining data from paired-end clone alignments to the O. sativa reference genome and physical maps. A subset of the computational predictions was validated using a new approach for BAC size determination. The result was a confirmed catalog of 674 expansions (25-38 Mb) and 611 (4-19 Mb) contractions, and 140 putative inversions (14-19 Mb) between the three Oryza species and O. sativa. In the expanded regions unique to O. sativa we found enrichment in transposable elements (TEs): long terminal repeats (LTRs) were randomly located across the chromosomes, and their insertion times corresponded to the date of the A genome radiation. Also, rice-expanded regions contained an over-representation of single-copy genes related to defense factors in the environment. This catalog of confirmed SV in reference to O. sativa provides an entry point for future research in genome evolution, speciation, domestication and novel gene discovery.
20627947	Protein disulfide isomerase like 1-1 participates in the maturation of proglutelin within the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice esp2 mutation was previously characterized by the abnormal accumulation of elevated levels of proglutelin and the absence of an endosperm-specific protein disulfide isomerase like (PDIL1-1). Here we show that Esp2 is the structural gene for PDIL1-1 and that this lumenal chaperone is asymmetrically distributed within the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and largely restricted to the cisternal ER. Temporal studies indicate that PDIL1-1 is essential for the maturation of proglutelin only when its rate of synthesis significantly exceeds its export from the ER, a condition resulting in its build up in the ER lumen and the induction of ER quality control processes which lower glutelin levels as well as those of the other storage proteins. As proglutelin is initially synthesized on the cisternal ER, its deposition within prolamine protein bodies in esp2 suggests that PDIL1-1 helps retain proglutelin in the cisternal ER lumen until it attains competence for ER export and, thereby, indirectly preventing heterotypic interactions with prolamine polypeptides.
20630103	Comprehensive analysis of NAC domain transcription factor gene family in Populus trichocarpa.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) domain proteins are plant-specific transcriptional factors known to play diverse roles in various plant developmental processes. NAC transcription factors comprise of a large gene family represented by more than 100 members in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean etc. Recently, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis was reported for NAC gene family from 11 plant species. However, no comprehensive study incorporating phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, conserved motifs, and expression profiling analysis has been presented thus far for the model tree species Populus.

RESULTS: In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of NAC gene family in Populus was performed. A total of 163 full-length NAC genes were identified in Populus, and they were phylogenetically clustered into 18 distinct subfamilies. The gene structure and motif compositions were considerably conserved among the subfamilies. The distributions of 120 Populus NAC genes were non-random across the 19 linkage groups (LGs), and 87 genes (73%) were preferentially retained duplicates that located in both duplicated regions. The majority of NACs showed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns based on EST frequency and microarray data analyses. However, the expression patterns of a majority of duplicate genes were partially redundant, suggesting the occurrence of subfunctionalization during subsequent evolutionary process. Furthermore, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to confirm the tissue-specific expression patterns of 25 NAC genes.

CONCLUSION: Based on the genomic organizations, we can conclude that segmental duplications contribute significantly to the expansion of Populus NAC gene family. The comprehensive expression profiles analysis provides first insights into the functional divergence among members in NAC gene family. In addition, the high divergence rate of expression patterns after segmental duplications indicates that NAC genes in Populus are likewise to have been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. Taken together, our results presented here would be helpful in laying the foundation for functional characterization of NAC gene family and further gaining an understanding of the structure-function relationship between these family members.
20632034	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	The transcription factor OsNAC5 in rice is a member of the plant-specific NAC family that regulates stress responses. Expression of OsNAC5 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid. Transactivation assays using rice protoplasts demonstrated that OsNAC5 is a transcriptional activator, and subcellular localization studies using OsNAC5-GFP fusion proteins showed that it is localized to the nucleus. Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1. To analyze the function of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of OsNAC6-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded. OsNAC5-overexpressing transgenic plants also had improved tolerance to high salinity compared to control plants. By microarray analysis, many stress-inducible genes, including the "late embryogenesis abundant" gene OsLEA3, were upregulated in rice plants that overexpressed OsNAC5. By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different. Furthermore, because OsNAC5 overexpression did not retard growth, OsNAC5 may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth.
20639576	Kinetic basis for the conjugation of auxin by a GH3 family indole-acetic acid-amido synthetase.	2010	J Biol Chem	The GH3 family of acyl-acid-amido synthetases catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of amino acid conjugates to modulate levels of active plant hormones, including auxins and jasmonates. Initial biochemical studies of various GH3s show that these enzymes group into three families based on sequence relationships and acyl-acid substrate preference (I, jasmonate-conjugating; II, auxin- and salicylic acid-conjugating; III, benzoate-conjugating); however, little is known about the kinetic and chemical mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we use GH3-8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH3-8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1.4-9-fold reductions in k(cat)/K(m) relative to IAA. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme uses a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong reaction sequence. In the first half-reaction, ATP binds first followed by IAA. Next, formation of an adenylated IAA intermediate results in release of pyrophosphate. The second half-reaction begins with binding of aspartate, which reacts with the adenylated intermediate to release IAA-Asp and AMP. Formation of a catalytically competent adenylated-IAA reaction intermediate was confirmed by mass spectrometry. These mechanistic studies provide insight on the reaction catalyzed by the GH3 family of enzymes to modulate plant hormone action.
20643810	A 9 bp cis-element in the promoters of class I small heat shock protein genes on chromosome 3 in rice mediates L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and heat shock responses.	2010	J Exp Bot	In rice, the class I small heat shock protein (sHSP-CI) genes were found to be selectively induced by L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) on chromosome 3 but not chromosome 1. Here it is shown that a novel cis-responsive element contributed to the differential regulation. By serial deletion and computational analysis, a 9 bp putative AZC-responsive element (AZRE), GTCCTGGAC, located between nucleotides -186 and -178 relative to the transcription initiation site of Oshsp17.3 was revealed. Deletion of this putative AZRE from the promoter abolished its ability to be induced by AZC. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the AZRE interacted specifically with nuclear proteins from AZC-treated rice seedlings. Two AZRE-protein complexes were detected by EMSA, one of which could be competed out by a canonical heat shock element (HSE). Deletion of the AZRE also affected the HS response. Furthermore, transient co-expression of the heat shock factor OsHsfA4b with the AZRE in the promoter of Oshsp17.3 was effective. The requirement for the putative AZRE for AZC and HS responses in transgenic Arabidopsis was also shown. Thus, AZRE represents an alternative form of heat HSE, and its interaction with canonical HSEs through heat shock factors may be required to respond to HS and AZC.
20647377	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	C-Glycosylflavones are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, and many of them have beneficial effects on human health. They are a special group of flavonoid glycosides in which the sugars are C-linked to the flavone skeleton. It has been long presumed that C-glycosylflavones have a different biosynthetic origin from O-glycosylflavonoids. In rice (Oryza sativa), a C-glucosyltransferase (OsCGT) that accepts 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates and a dehydratase activity that selectively converts C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones to 6C-glucosylflavones were recently described. In this study, we provide in vitro and in planta evidence that the rice P450 CYP93G2 protein encoded by Os06g01250 is a functional flavanone 2-hydroxylase. CYP93G2 is related to the CYP93B subfamily, which consists of dicot flavone synthase II enzymes. In the presence of NADPH, recombinant CYP93G2 converts naringenin and eriodictyol to the corresponding 2-hydroxyflavanones. In addition, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanones, which are modified by O-glycosylation in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form. The same structure was reported previously for the in vitro OsCGT reaction products. Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta. Furthermore, knocking down Os06g01250 in rice (O. sativa subsp. japonica 'Zhonghua 11') preferentially depleted the accumulation of C-glycosylapigenin, C-glycosylluteolin, and C-glycosylchrysoeriol but did not affect the levels of tricin, which is frequently present as O-glycosides in cereals. Taken together, our work conclusively assigned CYP93G2 as the first enzyme that channels flavanones to C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice.
20650543	Involvement of cell wall-bound phenolic acids in decrease in cell wall susceptibility to expansins during the cessation of rapid growth in internodes of floating rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	The cell walls in the elongating zone of submerged floating rice internodes show high susceptibility to expansins. When internode sections corresponding to such an elongation zone were incubated for 24h under osmotic stress conditions produced by treatment with 100mM polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), the cell wall susceptibility to expansins remained at its initial level, while the susceptibility of internode sections incubated under unstressed conditions decreased considerably during the same period. The contents of polysaccharides and phenolic acids as ferulic, diferulic and p-coumaric acids in the cell walls of internode sections increased substantially under unstressed conditions, but the increases were almost completely prevented by osmotic stress. Ferulic acid applied to internode sections under osmotic stress reduced the susceptibility of the cell walls to expansins and increased the levels of ferulic and diferulic acids in the cell walls, with little effect on the accumulation of polysaccharides. In contrast, applied p-coumaric acid increased the level of p-coumaric acid in the cell walls without a change in the levels of ferulic and diferulic acids but did not reduce the susceptibility to expansins. These results suggest that the deposition of ferulic and diferulic acids is a primary determinant in regulating the reduction of the susceptibility of cell walls to expansins in floating rice internodes.
20652530	Molecular marker survey and expression analyses of the rice submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	The major rice quantitative-trait locus Submergence 1 (Sub1) confers tolerance of submergence for about 2 weeks. To identify novel sources of tolerance, we have conducted a germplasm survey with allele-specific markers targeting SUB1A and SUB1C, two of the three transcription-factor genes within the Sub1 locus. The objective was to identify tolerant genotypes without the SUB1A gene or with the intolerant SUB1A-2 allele. The survey revealed that all tolerant genotypes possessed the tolerant Sub1 haplotype (SUB1A-1/SUB1C-1), whereas all accessions without the SUB1A gene were intolerant. Only the variety James Wee with the SUB1A-2 allele was moderately tolerant. However, some intolerant genotypes with the SUB1A-1 allele were identified and RT-PCR analyses were conducted to compare gene expression in tolerant and intolerant accessions. Initial analyses of leaf samples failed to reveal a clear association of SUB1A transcript abundance and tolerance. Temporal and spatial gene expression analyses subsequently showed that SUB1A expression in nodes and internodes associated best with tolerance across representative genotypes. In James Wee, transcript abundance was high in all tissues, suggesting that some level of tolerance might be conferred by high expression of the SUB1A-2 allele. To further assess tissue-specific expression, we have expressed the GUS reporter gene under the control of the SUB1A-1 promoter. The data revealed highly specific GUS expression at the base of the leaf sheath and in the leaf collar region. Specific expression in the growing part of rice leaves is well in agreement with the role of SUB1A in suppressing leaf elongation under submergence.
20663087	The rice dynamin-related protein DRP2B mediates membrane trafficking, and thereby plays a critical role in secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis.	2010	Plant J	Membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular compartments is an important process that regulates the deposition and metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides. Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs), which function in membrane tubulation and vesiculation are closely associated with cell wall biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which DRPs participate in cell wall formation are poorly understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm3 (BC3), a gene encoding OsDRP2B. Consistent with the expression of BC3 in mechanical tissues, the bc3 mutation reduces mechanical strength, which results from decreased cellulose content and altered secondary wall structure. OsDRP2B, one of three members of the DRP2 subfamily in rice (Oryza sativa L.), was identified as an authentic membrane-associated dynamin via in vitro biochemical analyses. Subcellular localization of fluorescence-tagged OsDRP2B and several compartment markers in protoplast cells showed that this protein not only lies at the PM and the clathrin-mediated vesicles, but also is targeted to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). An FM4-64 uptake assay in transgenic plants that express green fluorescent protein-tagged OsDRP2B verified its involvement in an endocytic pathway. BC3 mutation and overexpression altered the abundance of cellulose synthase catalytic subunit 4 (OsCESA4) in the PM and in the endomembrane systems. All of these findings lead us to conclude that OsDRP2B participates in the endocytic pathway, probably as well as in post-Golgi membrane trafficking. Mutation of OsDRP2B disturbs the membrane trafficking that is essential for normal cellulose biosynthesis of the secondary cell wall, thereby leading to inferior mechanical properties in rice plants.
20663089	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae.	2010	Plant J	The pathogen-induced plant defense signaling network consists of multiple components, although only some of them are characterized. Most of the known components function either as activators or repressors in host-pathogen interactions. Here we report that a mitogen-activated protein kinase, OsMPK6, functions both as an activator and a repressor in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal organism of bacterial blight disease. Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes. Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance. The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal organism of bacterial streak disease, in systemic tissues. Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants. These results suggest that OsMPK6 negatively regulates SAR. Thus OsMPK6 is a two-faced player in the rice-Xoo interaction.
20663584	Comparative proteomic analysis provides new insights into the regulation of carbon metabolism during leaf senescence of rice grown under field conditions.	2010	J Plant Physiol	In rice (Oryza sativa), approximately 60-100% of the carbon in mature grains originates from CO(2) assimilation during the grain-filling period, with the flag leaf as the most important contributor to the dry weight accumulation in grains. It is therefore important to understand molecular mechanisms of flag leaf senescence. To investigate the regulation of the metabolic network during leaf senescence, changes in protein expression were analyzed using a comparative proteomic approach during senescence of flag leaves in rice grown under field conditions. A total of 170 differentially expressed proteins during senescence of flag leaves were identified by mass spectrometry. Of these, there were 48 down-regulated proteins and 122 up-regulated proteins, corresponding to total 124 unique proteins. These identified proteins are involved in different cellular responses and metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, photorespiration, glycolysis, cell defense, redox homeostasis, signal transduction, protein synthesis, folding and assembly. Based on the abundance changes of these proteins, together with their putative functions and participation in physiological processes, we propose protein networks of carbon metabolism at the protein level during leaf senescence. These networks illustrate, for the first time, an overview of the regulations of carbon metabolic reactions occurring during leaf senescence.
20680611	High-resolution mapping of the brown planthopper resistance gene Bph6 in rice and characterizing its resistance in the 9311 and Nipponbare near isogenic backgrounds.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH) is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice. Exploring resistance genes from diverse germplasms and incorporating them into cultivated varieties are critical for controlling this insect. The rice variety Swarnalata was reported to carry a resistance gene (designated Bph6), which has not yet been assigned to a chromosome location and the resistance mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we identified and mapped this gene using the F(2) and backcrossing populations and characterized its resistance in indica 9311 and japonica Nipponbare using near isogenic lines (NILs). In analysis of 9311/Swarnalata F(2) population, the Bph6 gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 4 between the SSR markers RM6997 and RM5742. The gene was further mapped precisely to a 25-kb region delimited between the STS markers Y19 and Y9; and the distance between these markers is 25-kb in Nipponbare genome. The Bph6 explained 77.5% of the phenotypic variance of BPH resistance in F(2) population and 84.9% in BC(2)F(2) population. Allele from Swarnalata significantly increased resistance to the BPH, resulted in a reduced damage score. In characterization of Bph6-mediated resistance, the BPH insects showed significant preference between NIL-9311 and 9311 in 3 h and between NIL-NIP and Nipponbare in 120 h after release. BPH growth and development were inhibited, and the insect's survival rates were lower on Bph6-NIL plants, compared with the parents 9311 and Nipponbare. The results indicate that the Bph6 exerted prolonged antixenotic and antibiotic effects in Bph6-NIL plants, and NIL-9311 plants showed a quicker and stronger effect toward BPH than NIL-NIP plants.
20685968	Septum formation in amyloplasts produces compound granules in the rice endosperm and is regulated by plastid division proteins.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Storage tissues such as seed endosperm and tubers store starch in the form of granules in the amyloplast. In the rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm, each amyloplast produces compound granules consisting of several dozen polyhedral, sharp-edged and easily separable granules; whereas in other cereals, including wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and maize (Zea mays), each amyloplast synthesizes one granule. Despite extensive studies on mutants of starch synthesis in cereals, the molecular mechanisms involved in compound granule synthesis in rice have remained elusive. In this study, we expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to rice Brittle1 (BT1), an inner envelope membrane protein, to characterize dividing amyloplasts in the rice endosperm. Confocal microscopic analyses revealed that a septum-like structure, or cross-wall, containing BT1-GFP divides granules in the amyloplast. Plastid division proteins including FtsZ, Min and PDV2 play significant roles not only in amyloplast division, but also in septum synthesis, suggesting that amyloplast division and septum synthesis are related processes that share common factors. We propose that successive septum syntheses which create sections inside the amyloplast and de novo granule synthesis in each section are primarily responsible for the synthesis of compound granules.
20693412	Functional analysis of the structural domain of ARF proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	J Exp Bot	Auxin response factors (ARFs) are key regulators of plant growth and development. Through interaction with auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins, they influence the expression of auxin response genes. An ARF gene family has been predicted in rice, but the functions of the individual structural domains of the OsARFs remain obscure. Bioinformatics was used to analyse the position of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), middle region (MR), and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of OsARFs, and experimentally confirmed the presence of a classical monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the DBD. The DBD was shown to contribute to nuclear localization of OsARF proteins in addition to its known DNA-binding function. Interactions between 14 integrated OsARFs and 15 OsIAA proteins were tested using yeast two-hybrid assays. It was found that eight OsARF activators interacted with the 15 OsIAA proteins, while six OsARF repressors did not. The interactions between the MR+CTD or CTD of 10 OsARFs and 15 OsIAA proteins were also tested and the results were consistent with those of each intact OsARF, although some slight differences in interaction intensity were observed by α-galactosidase quantitative assays. The truncated CTD of OsARF11 did not interact with any OsIAA, implying that the CTD is required for ARF-IAA dimerization, and that the MR influences the interaction intensity in yeast. A subset of the interactions in yeast were also observed in tobacco plants using firefly luciferase complementation imaging assays, indicating that these interactions are specific in plants, and might have a special role in the auxin signalling response. This study provides new insight into the structure of OsARF proteins and ARF-Aux/IAA interactions.
20695529	Investigation of stability and disulfide bond shuffling of lipid transfer proteins by molecular dynamics simulation.	2010	Biochemistry	Proteins comprising each of the two plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein (LTP) families, LTP1s and LTP2s, share similar folds and biological functions and are stabilized by four native disulfide bonds. Disulfide-scrambling experiments suggested that rice LTP2 is more thermostable than rice LTP1 and identified multiple disulfide-scrambled isomers for LTP1 but only one for LTP2. According to the potential energy evaluated in two GROMOS force fields, however, rice LTP1 is more stable than either rice or wheat LTP2. Moreover, the published rice LTP2 NMR model structure is found to be highly unfavorable. The reasons for this are investigated, and it is found that the rice LTP2 sequence is in fact more compatible with the more ordered X-ray structure of wheat LTP2 than with the published rice LTP2 NMR model structure. The proposed disulfide bond shuffling of rice LTP1, rice LTP2, and, for comparative purposes, wheat LTP2 and a homology model combining the rice LTP2 sequence with the wheat LTP2 structure is then investigated with a computational disulfide-scrambling technique.
20699001	Identification of a novel iron regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in Fe homeostasis in Oryza sativa.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Iron (Fe) is the most limiting micronutrient element for crop production in alkaline soils. A number of transcription factors involved in regulating Fe uptake from soil and transport in plants have been identified. Analysis of transcriptome data from Oryza sativa grown under limiting Fe conditions reveals that transcript abundances of several genes encoding transcription factors are altered by Fe availability. These transcription factors are putative regulators of Fe deficiency responses.

RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, OsIRO3, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively. The expression of OsIRO3 is specifically induced by Fe deficiency, and not by other micronutrient deficiencies. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 were hypersensitive to Fe deficiency, indicating that the Fe deficiency response was compromised. Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRO3 was less than that in wild-type plants. Analysis of the transcript abundances of genes normally induced by Fe deficiency in OsIRO3 over-expressing plants indicated their induction was markedly suppressed.

CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (OsIRO3) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified. The inhibitory effect of OsIRO3 over-expression on Fe deficiency response gene expression combined with hypersensitivity of OsIRO3 over-expression lines to low Fe suggest that OsIRO3 is a negative regulator of the Fe deficiency response in rice.
20700573	Complete loss of photoperiodic response in the rice mutant line X61 is caused by deficiency of phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis gene.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, photoperiod is the most favorable external signal for floral induction because of the constant seasonal change throughout the years. Compared with Arabidopsis, however, a large part of the regulation mechanism of the photoperiodic response in rice still remains unclear due mainly to the lack of induced mutant genes. An induced mutant line X61 flowers 35 days earlier than its original variety Gimbozu under a natural photoperiod in Kyoto (35°01'N). We attempted to identify the mutant gene conferring early heading to X61. Experimental results showed that the early heading of X61 was conferred by a complete loss of photoperiodic response due to a novel single recessive mutant gene se13. This locus interacts with two crucial photoperiod sensitivity loci, Se1 and E1. Wild type alleles at these two loci do not function in coexistence with se13 in a homozygous state, suggesting that Se13 is an upstream locus of the Se1 and E1 loci. Linkage analysis showed that Se13 is located in a 110 kb region between the two markers, INDEL3735_1 and INDEL3735_3 on chromosome 1. A database search suggested that the Se13 gene is identical to AK101395 (=OsHY2), which encodes phytochromobilin synthase, a key enzyme in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that X61 harbors a 1 bp insertion in exon 1 of OsHY2, which induces a frame-shift mutation producing a premature stop codon. It is therefore considered that the complete loss of photoperiodic response of X61 is caused by a loss of function of the Se13 (OsHY2) gene involved in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.
20707904	Unique features of the rice blast resistance Pish locus revealed by large scale retrotransposon-tagging.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: R gene-mediated resistance is one of the most effective mechanisms of immunity against pathogens in plants. To date some components that regulate the primary steps of plant immunity have been isolated, however, the molecular dissection of defense signaling downstream of the R proteins remains to be completed. In addition, R genes are known to be highly variable, however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this variability remain obscure.

RESULTS: To identify novel factors required for R gene-mediated resistance in rice, we used rice insertional mutant lines, induced by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, in a genetic screening involving the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We inoculated 41,119 mutant lines with the fungus using a high throughput procedure, and identified 86 mutant lines with diminished resistance. A genome analysis revealed that 72 of the 86 lines contained mutations in a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing (NBS-LRR) protein. A genetic complementation analysis and a pathogenesis assay demonstrated that this NBS-LRR gene encodes Pish, which confers resistance against races of M. oryzae containing avrPish. The other 14 lines have intact copies of the Pish gene, suggesting that they may contain mutations in the signaling components downstream of Pish. The genome analysis indicated that Pish and its neighboring three NBS-LRR genes are high similar to one another and are tandemly located. An in silico analysis of a Tos17 flanking sequence database revealed that this region is a "hot spot" for insertion. Intriguingly, the insertion sites are not distributed evenly among these four NBS-LRR genes, despite their similarity at the sequence and expression levels.

CONCLUSIONS: In this work we isolated the R gene Pish, and identified several other mutants involved in the signal transduction required for Pish-mediated resistance. These results indicate that our genetic approach is efficient and useful for unveiling novel aspects of defense signaling in rice. Furthermore, our data provide experimental evidence that R gene clusters have the potential to be highly preferred targets for transposable element insertions in plant genomes. Based on this finding, a possible mechanism underlying the high variability of R genes is discussed.
20714705	Genetical and molecular analysis reveals a cooperating relationship between cytoplasmic male sterility- and fertility restoration-related genes in Oryza species.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Although the characterization of genes associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and fertility restoration (Rf) has been well documented, the evolutionary relationship between nuclear Rf and CMS factors in mitochondria in Oryza species is still less understood. Here, 41 accessions from 7 Oryza species with AA genome were employed for analyzing the evolutionary relationships between the CMS factors and Rf candidates on chromosome 10. The phylogenetic tree based on restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of CMS-associated mitochondrial genes showed that these 41 Oryza accessions fell into 3 distinct groups. Another phylogenetic tree based on PCR profiles of the nuclear Rf candidates on chromosome 10 was also established, and three groups were distinctively grouped. The accessions in each subgroup/group of the two phylogenetic trees are well parallel to each other. Furthermore, the 41 investigated accessions were test-crossed with Honglian (gametophytic type) and Wild-abortive (sporophytic type) CMS, and 5 groups were classified according to their restoring ability. The accessions in the same subgroup of the two phylogenetic trees shared similar fertility restoring pattern. Therefore, we conclude that the CMS-associated mitotypes are compatible to the Rf candidate-related nucleotypes, CMS and Rf have a parallel evolutionary relation in the Oryza species.
20716699	Characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying gibberellin perception complex formation in rice.	2010	Plant Cell	The DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) is a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), and most of the GA-associated responses are induced upon SLR1 degradation. It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 triggers F-box protein GID2-mediated SLR1 degradation. We identified a semidominant dwarf mutant, Slr1-d4, which contains a mutation in the region encoding the C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 (SLR1(G576V)). The GA-dependent degradation of SLR1(G576V) was reduced in Slr1-d4, and compared with SLR1, SLR1(G576V) showed reduced interaction with GID1 and almost none with GID2 when tested in yeast cells. Surface plasmon resonance of GID1-SLR1 and GID1-SLR1(G576V) interactions revealed that the GRAS domain of SLR1 functions to stabilize the GID1-SLR1 interaction by reducing its dissociation rate and that the G576V substitution in SLR1 diminishes this stability. These results suggest that the stable interaction of GID1-SLR1 through the GRAS domain is essential for the recognition of SLR1 by GID2. We propose that when the DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 binds with GID1, it enables the GRAS domain of SLR1 to interact with GID1 and that the stable GID1-SLR1 complex is efficiently recognized by GID2.
20720170	Analysis of the rice mitochondrial carrier family reveals anaerobic accumulation of a basic amino acid carrier involved in arginine metabolism during seed germination.	2010	Plant Physiol	Given the substantial changes in mitochondrial gene expression, the mitochondrial proteome, and respiratory function during rice (Oryza sativa) germination under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, we have attempted to identify changes in mitochondrial membrane transport capacity during these processes. We have assembled a preliminary rice mitochondrial carrier gene family of 50 members, defined its orthology to carriers of known function, and observed significant changes in microarray expression data for these rice genes during germination under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and across rice development. To determine if these transcript changes reflect alteration of the carrier profile itself and to determine which members of the family encode the major mitochondrial carrier proteins, we analyzed mitochondrial integral membrane protein preparations using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mass spectrometry, identifying seven distinct carrier proteins. We have used mass spectrometry-based quantitative approaches to compare the abundance of these carriers between mitochondria from dry seeds and those from aerobic- or anaerobic-germinated seeds. We highlight an anaerobic-enhanced basic amino acid carrier and show concomitant increases in mitochondrial arginase and the abundance of arginine and ornithine in anaerobic-germinated seeds, consistent with an anaerobic role of this mitochondria carrier. The potential role of this carrier in facilitating mitochondrial involvement in arginine metabolism and the plant urea cycle during the growth of rice coleoptiles and early seed nitrate assimilation under anaerobic conditions are discussed.
20727618	Soluble sugar availability of aerobically germinated barley, oat and rice coleoptiles in anoxia.	2010	J Plant Physiol	Physiological and metabolic responses to anoxia were compared for aerobically germinated seedlings of barley (Hordeum vulgare), oat (Avena sativa) and rice (Oryza sativa). Coleoptile growth of barley, oat and rice seedlings was suppressed by a 24 h-anoxic stress, but the growth of the rice coleoptiles was much greater than that of the barley and oat coleoptiles. ATP concentration in the anoxic rice coleoptiles was greater than that in the anoxic barley and oat coleoptiles. Concentrations of ethanol and activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the anoxic rice coleoptiles were also greater than those of the anoxic barley and oat coleoptiles, suggesting that ethanolic fermentation may be more active in the rice coleoptiles than in the barley and oat coleoptiles, where glycolysis and ethanolic fermentation are the main source of ATP production. Soluble sugar concentration in the anoxic rice coleoptiles was greater than that of the anoxic barley and oat coleoptiles. However, α-amylase, which catabolizes reserve starch to soluble sugars, was active in anoxic barley, oat and rice endosperms, and soluble sugar concentration in the anoxic barley, oat and rice endosperms was not significantly different. Therefore, anoxia stress may inhibit soluble sugar transport from the endosperms to the coleoptiles in barley and oat more than in rice. Since the availability of soluble sugar is essential for operation of glycolysis and fermentation in plant cells, ability for sugar transport from the endosperms to the coleoptiles may be one means to distinguish the coleoptile growth of these plant species in anoxia and anoxia tolerance of these plants.
20728960	Amelioration of salinity stress by exogenously applied spermidine or spermine in three varieties of indica rice differing in their level of salt tolerance.	2011	J Plant Physiol	We present here the comparative protective potentiality of exogenously applied polyamines (PAs), namely spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm), in mitigating NaCl toxicity and inducing short-term salinity tolerance in three indica rice varieties, namely M-1-48 (salt-sensitive), Nonabokra (salt-tolerant) and Gobindobhog (highly sensitive). The retardation in root length or shoot length and toxic Na(+) accumulation or K(+) loss, the considerable increment in malondialdehyde/H(2)O(2) accumulation or lipoxygenase activity, all of which were particularly noteworthy in M-1-48 and Gobindobhog during salinity stress, was appreciably reduced by co-treatment with Spd or Spm. Both the PAs also inhibited the extent of salt-induced protein carbonylation in all the varieties and enhanced protease activity, especially in Gobindobhog. The prevention of chlorophyll degradation was better with Spd in Nonabokra and Gobindobhog. While the salt-induced increase in anthocyanin or reducing sugar level was further prompted by Spd or Spm in all the varieties, the proline content was elevated by Spd particularly in Gobindobhog. During salinity stress, both the PAs were effective in lowering the putrescine accumulation in M-1-48 and Gobindobhog, and strikingly increasing the Spm level in all the varieties, the highest being in Gobindobhog. In addition, they enhanced the activity of peroxidases and compensated for the decreased catalase activity in all the varieties. Thus the two PAs could recuperate all the three varieties from salt-induced damages to different degrees. The salt injuries, encountered in M-1-48 and Gobindobhog, both of which showed greater susceptibility to salinity stress, were more pronouncedly alleviated and counteracted by the PAs, than the salt-tolerant Nonabokra. The reversal of inhibitory effect of salinity stress was conferred by preventing growth inhibition or various forms of cellular damages, maintaining proper K(+)/Na(+) balance or triggering the level of osmolytes and activity of antioxidant enzymes. Our communication offers a referenced evidence for an understanding of the mechanism by which higher PAs relieve the damages particularly in salt-sensitive rice varieties.
20729483	Genome-wide identification and analysis of drought-responsive microRNAs in Oryza sativa.	2010	J Exp Bot	In addition to regulating growth and development, the most important function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants is the regulation of a variety of cellular processes underlying plant adaptation to environmental stresses. To gain a deep understanding of the mechanism of drought tolerance in rice, genome-wide profiling and analysis of miRNAs was carried out in drought-challenged rice across a wide range of developmental stages, from tillering to inflorescence formation, using a microarray platform. Among the 30 miRNAs identified as significantly down- or up-regulated under the drought stress, 11 down-regulated miRNAs (miR170, miR172, miR397, miR408, miR529, miR896, miR1030, miR1035, miR1050, miR1088, and miR1126) and eight up-regulated miRNAs (miR395, miR474, miR845, miR851, miR854, miR901, miR903, and miR1125) were revealed for the first time to be induced by drought stress in plants, and nine (miR156, miR168, miR170, miR171, miR172, miR319, miR396, miR397, and miR408) showed opposite expression to that observed in drought-stressed Arabidopsis. The most conserved down-regulated miRNAs were ath-miR170, the miR171 family, and ath-miR396, and the most conserved up-regulated miRNAs were ptc-miR474 and ath-miR854a. The identification of differentially expressed novel plant miRNAs and their target genes, and the analysis of cis-elements provides molecular evidence for the possible involvement of miRNAs in the process of drought response and/or tolerance in rice.
20730544	Enhanced disease resistance in transgenic carrot (Daucus carota L.) plants over-expressing a rice cationic peroxidase.	2010	Planta	Plant class III peroxidases are involved in numerous responses related to pathogen resistance including controlling hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) levels and lignin formation. Peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of organic compounds using H(2)O(2) as an oxidant. We examined the mechanisms of disease resistance in a transgenic carrot line (P23) which constitutively over-expresses the rice cationic peroxidase OsPrx114 (previously known as PO-C1) and which exhibits enhanced resistance to necrotrophic foliar pathogens. OsPrx114 over-expression led to a slight enhancement of constitutive transcript levels of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. These transcript levels were dramatically increased in line P23 compared to controls [GUS construct under the control of 35S promoter (35S::GUS)] when tissues were treated with cell wall fragments of the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SS-walls), and to a lesser extent with 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid. There was no basal increase in basal H(2)O(2) levels in tissues of the line P23. However, during an oxidative burst response elicited by SS-walls, H(2)O(2) accumulation was reduced in line P23 despite, typical media alkalinization associated with oxidative burst responses was observed, suggesting that OsPrx114 was involved in rapid H(2)O(2) consumption during the oxidative burst response. Tap roots of line P23 had increased lignin formation in the outer periderm tissues, which was further increased during challenge inoculation with Alternaria radicina. Plant susceptibility to a biotrophic pathogen, Erysiphe heraclei, was not affected. Disease resistance to necrotrophic pathogens in carrot as a result of OsPrx114 over-expression is manifested through increased PR transcript accumulation, rapid removal of H(2)O(2) during oxidative burst response and enhanced lignin formation.
20732878	Subgroup 4 R2R3-MYBs in conifer trees: gene family expansion and contribution to the isoprenoid- and flavonoid-oriented responses.	2010	J Exp Bot	Transcription factors play a fundamental role in plants by orchestrating temporal and spatial gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. Several R2R3-MYB genes of the Arabidopsis subgroup 4 (Sg4) share a C-terminal EAR motif signature recently linked to stress response in angiosperm plants. It is reported here that nearly all Sg4 MYB genes in the conifer trees Picea glauca (white spruce) and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) form a monophyletic clade (Sg4C) that expanded following the split of gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. Deeper sequencing in P. glauca identified 10 distinct Sg4C sequences, indicating over-representation of Sg4 sequences compared with angiosperms such as Arabidopsis, Oryza, Vitis, and Populus. The Sg4C MYBs share the EAR motif core. Many of them had stress-responsive transcript profiles after wounding, jasmonic acid (JA) treatment, or exposure to cold in P. glauca and P. taeda, with MYB14 transcripts accumulating most strongly and rapidly. Functional characterization was initiated by expressing the P. taeda MYB14 (PtMYB14) gene in transgenic P. glauca plantlets with a tissue-preferential promoter (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) and a ubiquitous gene promoter (ubiquitin). Histological, metabolite, and transcript (microarray and targeted quantitative real-time PCR) analyses of PtMYB14 transgenics, coupled with mechanical wounding and JA application experiments on wild-type plantlets, allowed identification of PtMYB14 as a putative regulator of an isoprenoid-oriented response that leads to the accumulation of sesquiterpene in conifers. Data further suggested that PtMYB14 may contribute to a broad defence response implicating flavonoids. This study also addresses the potential involvement of closely related Sg4C sequences in stress responses and plant evolution.
20734061	Genetic analysis of two OsLpa1-like genes in Arabidopsis reveals that only one is required for wild-type seed phytic acid levels.	2010	Planta	Phytic acid (inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate or InsP(6)) is the primary storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. The rice OsLpa1 encodes a novel protein required for wild-type levels of seed InsP(6) and was identified from a low phytic acid (lpa) mutant exhibiting a 45-50% reduction in seed InsP(6). OsLpa1 is highly conserved in plants and Arabidopsis contains two OsLpa1-like genes, At3g45090 and At5g60760. Analysis of homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of At5g60760 revealed significantly reduced levels of seed InsP(6) while no changes were observed in seeds of At3g45090 mutants. A double knockout mutant of At5g60760 and At3g45090 was created and its seed InsP(6) content was similar to that of the At5g60760 mutant indicating that At3g45090 does not provide functional redundancy. OsLpa1 was confirmed to be the ortholog of At5g60760 by complementation of a knockout mutant with a cDNA clone corresponding to the largest of three alternative transcripts of OsLpa1. The spatial and temporal expression of At5g60760 during seed development is consistent with its involvement in seed InsP(6) biosynthesis.
20737168	Characterization of phytoene synthases from cassava and their involvement in abiotic stress-mediated responses.	2010	Planta	Abiotic stress stimuli induce the increased synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), which is generated through the cleavage of xanthophyll precursors. To cope with the increased xanthophyll demand, maize and rice contain a third stress-induced gene copy, coding for phytoene synthase (PSY), which catalyzes the first carotenoid-specific reaction in the pathway. To investigate whether this specific response extends beyond the Poaceae, cassava was analyzed, an important tropical crop known for its drought tolerance. We also found three PSY genes in cassava, one of which (MePSY3) forms a separate branch with the stress-specific Poaceae homologs. However, MePSY3 transcripts were virtually absent in all tissues investigated and did not change upon abiotic stress treatment. In contrast, the two remaining PSY genes contributed differentially to carotenoid biosynthesis in leaves, roots, and flower organs and responded towards drought and salt-stress conditions. Detailed analyses of PSY and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (MeNCED) expression and resulting ABA levels revealed MePSY1 as the main stress-responsive paralog. In the presence of high carotenoid levels in leaves, MePSY1 appeared to support, but not to be rate-limiting for ABA formation; MeNCED represented the main driver. The inverse situation was found in roots where carotenoid levels are low. Moreover, ABA formation and the relative induction kinetics showed discrimination between drought and salt stress. Compared to rice as a drought-intolerant species, the drought response in cassava followed a different kinetic regime. The difference is thought to represent a component contributing to the large differences in the adaptation towards water supply.
20737264	Genetic analysis of starch paste viscosity parameters in glutinous rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Starch paste viscosity plays an important role in estimating the cooking, eating, and processing quality of rice. The inheritance of starch paste viscosity in glutinous rice remains undefined. In the present study, 118 glutinous rice accessions were collected, and the genotypes of 17 starch synthesis-related genes (SSRG) were analyzed by using 43 gene-specific molecular markers. Association analysis indicated that 10 of 17 SSRGs were involved in controlling the rapid visco analyzer (RVA) profile parameters. Among these, the PUL gene was identified to play an important role in control of peak viscosity (PKV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), cool paste viscosity (CPV), breakdown viscosity (BDV), peak time (PeT), and paste temperature (PaT) in glutinous rice. Other SSRGs involved only a few RVA profile parameters. Furthermore, interactions between SSRGs were found being responsible for PeT, PaT, and BDV. Some of the RVA parameters, including PKV, HPV, CPV, CSV, and PaT, were mainly governed by single SSRG, whereas other parameters, such as BDV, SBV, and PeT, were controlled by a few SSRGs, functioning cooperatively. Further, three near-isogenic lines (NIL) of a japonica glutinous cv. Suyunuo as genetic background, with PUL, SSIII-1, and SSIII-2 alleles replaced with those of indica cv. Guichao 2, were employed to verify the genetic effects of the various genes, and the results were consistent with those obtained from the association analysis. These findings indicated that starch paste viscosity in glutinous rice had a complex genetic system, and the PUL gene played an important role in determining the RVA profile parameters in glutinous rice. These results provide important information for potentially improving the quality of glutinous rice.
20796287	Transpositional reactivation of the Dart transposon family in rice lines derived from introgressive hybridization with Zizania latifolia.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: It is widely recognized that interspecific hybridization may induce "genome shock", and lead to genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids and/or backcrossed introgressants. A prominent component involved in the genome shock is reactivation of cryptic transposable elements (TEs) in the hybrid genome, which is often associated with alteration in the elements' epigenetic modifications like cytosine DNA methylation. We have previously reported that introgressants derived from hybridization between Oryza sativa (rice) and Zizania latifolia manifested substantial methylation re-patterning and rampant mobilization of two TEs, a copia retrotransposon Tos17 and a MITE mPing. It was not known however whether other types of TEs had also been transpositionally reactivated in these introgressants, their relevance to alteration in cytosine methylation, and their impact on expression of adjacent cellular genes.

RESULTS: We document in this study that the Dart TE family was transpositionally reactivated followed by stabilization in all three studied introgressants (RZ1, RZ2 and RZ35) derived from introgressive hybridization between rice (cv. Matsumae) and Z. latifolia, while the TEs remained quiescent in the recipient rice genome. Transposon-display (TD) and sequencing verified the element's mobility and mapped the excisions and re-insertions to the rice chromosomes. Methylation-sensitive Southern blotting showed that the Dart TEs were heavily methylated along their entire length, and moderate alteration in cytosine methylation patterns occurred in the introgressants relative to their rice parental line. Real-time qRT-PCR quantification on the relative transcript abundance of six single-copy genes flanking the newly excised or inserted Dart-related TE copies indicated that whereas marked difference in the expression of all four genes in both tissues (leaf and root) were detected between the introgressants and their rice parental line under both normal and various stress conditions, the difference showed little association with the presence or absence of the newly mobilized Dart-related TEs.

CONCLUSION: Introgressive hybridization has induced transpositional reactivation of the otherwise immobile Dart-related TEs in the parental rice line (cv. Matsumae), which was accompanied with a moderate alteration in the element's cytosine methylation. Significant difference in expression of the Dart-adjacent genes occurred between the introgressants and their rice parental line under both normal and various abiotic stress conditions, but the alteration in gene expression was not coupled with the TEs.
20805329	WAVY LEAF1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, regulates shoot development by maintaining MicroRNA and trans-acting small interfering RNA accumulation in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	In rice (Oryza sativa), trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-siRNA) is essential for shoot development, including shoot apical meristem (SAM) formation and leaf morphogenesis. The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway. About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development. Map-based cloning of WAF1 revealed that it encodes an RNA methyltransferase, a homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HUA ENHANCER1. The reduced accumulation of small RNAs in waf1 indicated that the stability of the small RNA was decreased. Despite the greatly reduced level of microRNAs and ta-siRNA, microarray and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that the expression levels of their target genes were not always enhanced. A double mutant between sho and waf1 showed an enhanced SAM defect, suggesting that the amount and/or quality of ta-siRNA is crucial for SAM maintenance. Our results indicate that stabilization of small RNAs by WAF1 is indispensable for rice development, especially for SAM maintenance and leaf morphogenesis governed by the ta-siRNA pathway. In addition, the inconsistent relationship between the amount of small RNAs and the level of the target mRNA in waf1 suggest that there is a complex regulatory mechanism that modifies the effects of microRNA/ta-siRNA on the expression of the target gene.
20807214	Durable panicle blast-resistance gene Pb1 encodes an atypical CC-NBS-LRR protein and was generated by acquiring a promoter through local genome duplication.	2010	Plant J	Rice blast is one of the most widespread and destructive plant diseases worldwide. Breeders have used disease resistance (R) genes that mediate fungal race-specific 'gene-for-gene' resistance to manage rice blast, but the resistance is prone to breakdown due to high pathogenic variability of blast fungus. Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a blast-resistance gene derived from the indica cultivar 'Modan'. Pb1-mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation. We isolated the Pb1 gene by map-based cloning. It encoded a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein. The Pb1 protein sequence differed from previously reported R-proteins, particularly in the NBS domain, in which the P-loop was apparently absent and some other motifs were degenerated. Pb1 was located within one of tandemly repeated 60-kb units, which presumably arose through local genome duplication. Pb1 transcript levels increased during the development of Pb1+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance. Promoter:GUS analysis indicated that genome duplication played a crucial role in the generation of Pb1 by placing a promoter sequence upstream of its coding sequence, thereby conferring a Pb1-characteristic expression pattern to a transcriptionally inactive 'sleeping' resistance gene. We discuss possible determinants for the durability of Pb1-mediated blast resistance.
20822502	Biological implications of the occurrence of 32 members of the XTH (xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase) family of proteins in the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens.	2010	Plant J	This comprehensive overview of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) family of genes and proteins in bryophytes, based on research using genomic resources that are newly available for the moss Physcomitrella patens, provides new insights into plant evolution. In angiosperms, the XTH genes are found in large multi-gene families, probably reflecting the diverse roles of individual XTHs in various cell types. As there are fewer cell types in P. patens than in angiosperms such as Arabidopsis and rice, it is tempting to deduce that there are fewer XTH family genes in bryophytes. However, the present study unexpectedly identified as many as 32 genes that potentially encode XTH family proteins in the genome of P. patens, constituting a fairly large multi-gene family that is comparable in size with those of Arabidopsis and rice. In situ localization of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity in this moss indicates that some P. patens XTH proteins exhibit biochemical functions similar to those found in angiosperms, and that their expression profiles are tissue-dependent. However, comparison of structural features of families of XTH genes between P. patens and angiosperms demonstrated the existence of several bryophyte-specific XTH genes with distinct structural and functional features that are not found in angiosperms. These bryophyte-specific XTH genes might have evolved to meet morphological and functional needs specific to the bryophyte. These findings raise interesting questions about the biological implications of the XTH family of proteins in non-seed plants.
20822505	OsMADS6 plays an essential role in endosperm nutrient accumulation and is subject to epigenetic regulation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2010	Plant J	MADS-box transcription factors are known for their roles in plant growth and development. The regulatory mechanisms of spatial and temporal specific expression of MADS-box genes and the function of MADS-box genes in other biological processes are still to be explored. Here, we report that OsMADS6 is highly expressed in flower and endosperm in Oryza sativa (rice). In addition to displaying a homeotic organ identity phenotype in all the four whorls of the flowers, the endosperm development is severely affected in its mutant. At least 32% of the seeds lacked starch filling and aborted. For seeds that have starch filling and develop to maturity, the starch content is reduced by at least 13%. In addition, the seed shape changes from elliptical to roundish, and the protein content increases from 12.1 to 15.0% (P < 0.05). Further investigation shows that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes, encoding the rate-limiting step enzyme in the starch synthesis pathway, are subject to the regulation of OsMADS6. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR analyses on the chromatin of the OsMADS6 gene find that H3K27 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is silenced, and that H3K36 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is highly activated. Point mutation analysis reveals that leucine at position 83 is critical to OsMADS6 function.
20823253	Gene limiting cadmium accumulation in rice.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Intake of toxic cadmium (Cd) from rice caused Itai-itai disease in the past and it is still a threat for human health. Therefore, control of the accumulation of Cd from soil is an important food-safety issue, but the molecular mechanism for the control is unknown. Herein, we report a gene (OsHMA3) responsible for low Cd accumulation in rice that was isolated from a mapping population derived from a cross between a high and low Cd-accumulating cultivar. The gene encodes a transporter belonging to the P(1B)-type ATPase family, but shares low similarity with other members. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that the transporter from the low-Cd cultivar is functional, but the transporter from the high-Cd cultivar had lost its function, probably because of the single amino acid mutation. The transporter is mainly expressed in the tonoplast of root cells at a similar level in both the low and high Cd-accumulating cultivars. Overexpression of the functional gene from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar selectively decreased accumulation of Cd, but not other micronutrients in the grain. Our results indicated that OsHMA3 from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above-ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles.
20830488	Transposition and target preferences of an active nonautonomous DNA transposon nDart1 and its relatives belonging to the hAT superfamily in rice.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	The nonautonomous nDart1 element in the hAT superfamily is one of a few active DNA transposons in rice. Its transposition can be induced by crossing with a line containing an active autonomous element, aDart1, and stabilized by segregating aDart1. No somaclonal variation should occur in nDart1-promoted gene tagging because no tissue culture is involved in nDart1 activation. By transposon display analysis, we examined the activities of nDart1-related elements in the selfed progeny of a mutable virescent pyl-v plant containing aDart1. Although various nDart1-related elements are present in the rice genome, only nDart1-3 subgroup elements, nDart1-0 and nDart1-3 in particular, were found to be transposed frequently and integrated into various sites almost all over the genome, and a fraction of the transposed elements were found to be transmitted to the next generation. More than half of the newly integrated elements were identified as nDart1-0. Analysis of the newly inserted sites revealed that the nDart1-3 subgroup elements were predominantly integrated into single-copy regions. More than 60% of the transposed elements were inserted into the genic regions that comprise putative coding regions and their 0.5-kb flanking segments, and approximately two-thirds of them were within the 0.5-kb area in front of the putative initiation codons, i.e., promoter-proximal genic regions. These characteristic features of nDart1-3 subgroup elements seem to be suitable for developing an efficient and somaclonal variation-free gene tagging system for rice functional genomics.
20830595	Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice.	2010	Planta	A dwarf mutant, dwarf 62 (d62), was isolated from rice cultivar 93-11 by mutagenesis with γ-rays. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant had multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarfism, wide and dark-green leaf blades, reduced tiller numbers, late and asynchronous heading, short roots, partial male sterility, etc. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by the recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. Using molecular markers, the D62 gene was fine mapped in 131-kb region at the short arm of chromosome 6. Positional cloning of D62 gene revealed that it was the same locus as DLT/OsGRAS-32, which encodes a member of the GRAS family. In previous studies, the DLT/OsGRAS-32 is confirmed to play positive roles in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sequence analysis showed that the d62 carried a 2-bp deletion in ORF region of D62 gene which led to a loss-of-function mutation. The function of D62 gene was confirmed by complementation experiment. RT-PCR analysis and promoter activity analysis showed that the D62 gene expressed in all tested tissues including roots, stems, leaves and panicles of rice plant. The d62 mutant exhibited decreased activity of α-amylase in endosperm and reduced content of endogenous GA(1). The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant. Briefly, these results demonstrated that the D62 (DLT/OsGRAS-32) not only participated in the regulation of BR signaling, but also influenced GA metabolism in rice.
20838758	Identification and development of a functional marker of TaGW2 associated with grain weight in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	The OsGW2 gene is involved in rice grain development, influencing grain width and weight. Its ortholog in wheat, TaGW2, was considered as a candidate gene related to grain development. We found that TaGW2 is constitutively expressed, with three orthologs expressing simultaneously. The coding sequence (CDS) of TaGW2 is 1,275 bp encoding a protein with 424 amino acids, and has a functional domain shared with OsGW2. No divergence was detected within the CDS sequences in the same locus in ten varieties. Genome-specific primers were designed based on the sequence divergence of the promoter regions in the three orthologous genes, and TaGW2 was located in homologous group 6 chromosomes through CS nulli-tetrasomic (NT). Two SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaGW2-6A, forming two haplotypes: Hap-6A-A (-593A and -739G) and Hap-6A-G (-593G and -769A). A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was developed based on the -593 A-G polymorphism to distinguish the two haplotypes in TaGW2-6A. This gene was fine mapped 0.6 cM from marker cfd80.2 near the centromere in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Two hundred sixty-five Chinese wheat varieties were genotyped and association analysis revealed that Hap-6A-A was significantly associated with wider grains and higher one-thousand grain weight (TGW) in two crop seasons. qRT-PCR revealed a negative relationship between TaGW2 expression level and grain width. The Hap-6A-A frequencies in Chinese varieties released at different periods showed that it had been strongly positively selected in breeding. In landraces, Hap-6A-A is mainly distributed in southern Chinese wheat regions. Association analysis also indicated that Hap-6A-A not only increased TGW by more than 3 g, but also had earlier heading and maturity. In contrast to Chinese varieties, Hap-6A-G was the predominant haplotype in European varieties; Hap-6A-A was mainly present in varieties released in the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary and Portugal.
20603282	Disruption of a gene for rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, impairs pollen function but pollen maturation is unaffected.	2010	J Exp Bot	Sucrose transporters (SUTs) are known to play critical roles in the uptake of sucrose from the apoplast in various steps of sugar translocation. Because developing pollen is symplastically isolated from anther tissues, it is hypothesized that SUTs are active in the uptake of apoplastic sucrose into pollen. To investigate this possibility, a comprehensive expression analysis was performed for members of the SUT gene family in the developing pollen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using real-time RT-PCR combined with a laser microdissection technique. Among the five SUT genes, OsSUT1 and OsSUT3 were found to be preferentially expressed and had temporal expression patterns that were distinct from each other. Expression of OsSUT1 in pollen was confirmed by a promoter-GUS fusion assay. The physiological function of OsSUT1 in pollen was further investigated using retrotransposon insertion mutant lines. While the homozygote of disrupted OsSUT1 (SUT1-/-) could not be obtained, heterozygote plants (SUT1+/-) showed normal grain filling. Their progeny segregated into SUT1+/- and SUT1+/+ with the ratio of 1:1, suggesting that the pollen disrupted for OsSUT1 is dysfunctional. This hypothesis was reinforced in vivo by a backcross of SUT1+/- plants with wild-type plants and also by in vitro pollen germination on the artificial media. However, starch accumulation during pollen development was not affected by disruption of OsSUT1, suggesting that the sugar(s) required for starch biosynthesis is supplied by other sugar transporters.
20498338	Involvement of silicon influx transporter OsNIP2;1 in selenite uptake in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) as a staple food, provides a major source of dietary selenium (Se) for humans, which essentially requires Se, however, the molecular mechanism for Se uptake is still poorly understood. Herein, we show evidence that the uptake of selenite, a main bioavailable form of Se in paddy soils, is mediated by a silicon (Si) influx transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1) in rice. Defect of OsNIP2;1 resulted in a significant decrease in the Se concentration of the shoots and xylem sap when selenite was given. However, there was no difference in the Se concentration between the wild-type rice and mutant of OsNIP2;1 when selenate was supplied. A short-term uptake experiment showed that selenite uptake greatly increased with decreasing pH in the external solution. Si as silicic acid did not inhibit the Se uptake from selenite in both rice and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) at low pHs. Expression of OsNIP2;1 in yeast enhanced the selenite uptake at pH 3.5 and 5.5 but not at pH 7.5. On the other hand, defect of Si efflux transporter Lsi2 did not affect the uptake of Se either from selenite or selenate. Taken together, our results indicate that Si influx transporter OsNIP2;1 is permeable to selenite.
20566706	DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously.	2010	Plant Physiol	The three most important agronomic traits of rice (Oryza sativa), yield, plant height, and flowering time, are controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, a newly identified QTL, DTH8 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 8), was found to regulate these three traits in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor and the complementary experiment increased significantly days to heading, plant height, and number of grains per panicle in CSSL61 (a chromosome segment substitution line that carries the nonfunctional DTH8 allele) with the Asominori functional DTH8 allele under long-day conditions. DTH8 is expressed in most tissues and its protein is localized to the nucleus exclusively. The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions. Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS). Meanwhile, the transcription of DTH8 has been proved to be independent of Ghd7 and Hd1, and the natural mutation of this gene caused weak photoperiod sensitivity and shorter plant height. Taken together, these data indicate that DTH8 probably plays an important role in the signal network of photoperiodic flowering as a novel suppressor as well as in the regulation of plant height and yield potential.
20487382	Spatio-temporal patterns of genome evolution in allotetraploid species of the genus Oryza.	2010	Plant J	Despite knowledge that polyploidy is widespread and a major evolutionary force in flowering plant diversification, detailed comparative molecular studies on polyploidy have been confined to only a few species and families. The genus Oryza is composed of 23 species that are classified into ten distinct 'genome types' (six diploid and four polyploid), and is emerging as a powerful new model system to study polyploidy. Here we report the identification, sequence and comprehensive comparative annotation of eight homoeologous genomes from a single orthologous region (Adh1-Adh2) from four allopolyploid species representing each of the known Oryza genome types (BC, CD, HJ and KL). Detailed comparative phylogenomic analyses of these regions within and across species and ploidy levels provided several insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of genome organization and evolution of this region in 'natural' polyploids of Oryza. The major findings of this study are that: (i) homoeologous genomic regions within the same nucleus experience both independent and parallel evolution, (ii) differential lineage-specific selection pressures do not occur between polyploids and their diploid progenitors, (iii) there have been no dramatic structural changes relative to the diploid ancestors, (iv) a variation in the molecular evolutionary rate exists between the two genomes in the BC complex species even though the BC and CD polyploid species appear to have arisen <2 million years ago, and (v) there are no clear distinctions in the patterns of genome evolution in the diploid versus polyploid species.
20498340	Knockout of a bacterial-type ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, AtSTAR1, results in increased aluminum sensitivity in Arabidopsis.	2010	Plant Physiol	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent a large family in plants, but the functions of most of these transporters are unknown. Here we report a gene, AtSTAR1, only encoding an ATP-binding domain of a bacterial-type ABC transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). AtSTAR1 is an ortholog of rice (Oryza sativa) OsSTAR1, which has been implicated in aluminum (Al) tolerance. Knockout of AtSTAR1 resulted in increased sensitivity to Al and earlier flowering. Unlike OsSTAR1, AtSTAR1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots and its expression was not induced by Al or other stresses. Investigation of tissue-specific localization of AtSTAR1 through beta-glucuronidase fusion revealed that AtSTAR1 was predominantly expressed at outer cell layers of root tips and developing leaves, whose localization is also different from those of OsSTAR1. However, introduction of OsSTAR1 into atstar1 mutant rescued the sensitivity of atstar1 to Al, indicating that AtSTAR1 has a similar function as OsSTAR1. Furthermore, we found that AtSTAR1 may interact with ALS3, a transmembrane-binding domain in Arabidopsis to form a complex because introduction of OsSTAR1, a functional substitute of AtSTAR1, into als3 mutant resulted in the loss of OsSTAR1 protein. All these findings indicate that AtSTAR1 is involved in the basic detoxification of Al in Arabidopsis.
20581256	Boron toxicity tolerance in barley through reduced expression of the multifunctional aquaporin HvNIP2;1.	2010	Plant Physiol	Boron (B) toxicity is a significant limitation to cereal crop production in a number of regions worldwide. Here we describe the cloning of a gene from barley (Hordeum vulgare), underlying the chromosome 6H B toxicity tolerance quantitative trait locus. It is the second B toxicity tolerance gene identified in barley. Previously, we identified the gene Bot1 that functions as an efflux transporter in B toxicity-tolerant barley to move B out of the plant. The gene identified in this work encodes HvNIP2;1, an aquaporin from the nodulin-26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily that was recently described as a silicon influx transporter in barley and rice (Oryza sativa). Here we show that a rice mutant for this gene also shows reduced B accumulation in leaf blades compared to wild type and that the mutant protein alters growth of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under high B. HvNIP2;1 facilitates significant transport of B when expressed in Xenopus oocytes compared to controls and to another NIP (NOD26), and also in yeast plasma membranes that appear to have relatively high B permeability. We propose that tolerance to high soil B is mediated by reduced expression of HvNIP2;1 to limit B uptake, as well as by increased expression of Bot1 to remove B from roots and sensitive tissues. Together with Bot1, the multifunctional aquaporin HvNIP2;1 is an important determinant of B toxicity tolerance in barley.
20525005	A rice fungal MAMP-responsive MAPK cascade regulates metabolic flow to antimicrobial metabolite synthesis.	2010	Plant J	Plants recognize potential microbial pathogens through microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and activate a series of defense responses, including cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diverse anti-microbial secondary metabolites. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are known to play a pivotal role in mediating MAMP signals; however, the signaling pathway from a MAPK cascade to the activation of defense responses is poorly understood. Here, we found in rice that the chitin elicitor, a fungal MAMP, activates two rice MAPKs (OsMPK3 and OsMPK6) and one MAPK kinase (OsMKK4). OsMPK6 was essential for the chitin elicitor-induced biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins. Conditional expression of the active form of OsMKK4 (OsMKK4(DD) ) induced extensive alterations in gene expression, which implied dynamic changes of metabolic flow from glycolysis to secondary metabolite biosynthesis while suppressing basic cellular activities such as translation and cell division. OsMKK4(DD) also induced various defense responses, such as cell death, biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins and lignin but not generation of extracellular ROS. OsMKK4(DD) -induced cell death and expression of diterpenoid phytoalexin pathway genes, but not that of phenylpropanoid pathway genes, were dependent on OsMPK6. Collectively, the OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade plays a crucial role in reprogramming plant metabolism during MAMP-triggered defense responses.
20487381	Genome-wide mapping of cytosine methylation revealed dynamic DNA methylation patterns associated with genes and centromeres in rice.	2010	Plant J	We conducted genome-wide mapping of cytosine methylation using methylcytosine immunoprecipitation combined with Illumina sequencing. The chromosomal distribution pattern of methylated DNA is similar to the heterochromatin distribution pattern on rice chromosomes. The DNA methylation patterns of rice genes are similar to those in Arabidopsis thaliana, including distinct methylation patterns asssociated with gene bodies and promoters. The DNA sequences in the core domains of rice Cen4, Cen5 and Cen8 showed elevated methylation levels compared with sequences in the pericentromeric regions. In addition, elevated methylation levels were associated with the DNA sequences in the CENH3-binding subdomains, compared with the sequences in the flanking H3 subdomains. In contrast, the centromeric domain of Cen11, which is composed exclusively of centromeric satellite DNA, is hypomethylated compared with the pericentromeric domains. Thus, the DNA sequences associated with functional centromeres can be either hypomethylated or hypermethylated. The methylation patterns of centromeric DNA appear to be correlated with the composition of the associated DNA sequences. We propose that both hypomethylation and hypermethylation of CENH3-associated DNA sequences can serve as epigenetic marks to distinguish where CENH3 deposition will occur within the surrounding H3 chromatin.
20460361	Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice.	2010	J Exp Bot	The Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins have been implicated in different cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings. ZFP179 encodes a 17.95 kDa protein with two C2H2-type zinc finger motifs having transcriptional activation activity. The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments. Overexpression of ZFP179 in rice increased salt tolerance and the transgenic seedlings showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA. The increased levels of free proline and soluble sugars were observed in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants under salt stress. The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress. Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress.
20607362	A rice DEAD-box protein, OsRH36, can complement an Arabidopsis atrh36 mutant, but cannot functionally replace its yeast homolog Dbp8p.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	DEAD-box proteins comprise a large family and function in RNA metabolism. Although DEAD-box proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes, little is known about the role of DEAD-box proteins in rice. In this study, we identified a rice DEAD-box protein, OsRH36, and demonstrated that OsRH36 and AtRH36 are functional orthologs. OsRH36 was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant and the OsRH36-GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus and nucleolus. Furthermore, functional complementation tests among three homologous DEAD-box protein genes indicated that OsRH36 can restore segregation distortion in the Arabidopsis atrh36-1 mutant, but cannot complement the lethal phenotype in the yeast dbp8p mutant. Moreover, mutation of osrh36 also led to defective transmission of the osrh36 allele, as shown for the atrh36 mutants of Arabidopsis. Previously, we have shown that AtRH36 is involved at an early stage of rRNA maturation and is required for synchronous development of female gametophytes in Arabidopsis. Therefore, we suggest that OsRH36 is required for rRNA biogenesis and megagametogenesis in rice, consistent with the function of AtRH36 in Arabidopsis.
20443024	Isolation and characterization of a rice mutant with narrow and rolled leaves.	2010	Planta	Appropriate leaf shape has proved to be useful in improving photosynthesis and increasing grain yield. To understand the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, we identified a rice mutant nrl1, which was characterized by a phenotype of narrow and rolled leaves. Microscopic observation showed that the mutation significantly decreased the number of vascular bundles of leaf and stem. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation was controlled by a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene. To isolate the nrl1 gene, 756 F(2) and F(3) mutant individuals from a cross of the nrl1 mutant with Longtepu were used and a high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the nrl1 gene was made. Finally, the gene was mapped in 16.5 kb region between marker RL21 and marker RL36 within the BAC clone OSJNBa0027H05. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the mutant showed that there was a 58 bp deletion within the second exon of the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene (TIGR locus Os12g36890). The nrl1 mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild-type cellulose synthase-like D4 gene. Accordingly, the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene was identified as the NRL1 gene. NRL1 was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in panicles and internodes. NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated, whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant. These findings suggested that there might be a functional association between these genes in regulating leaf development.
20439547	Identification and application of a rice senescence-associated promoter.	2010	Plant Physiol	SAG39 is a rice (Oryza sativa) gene that encodes a cysteine protease. SAG39 shares 55% homology with the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) senescence-associated protein SAG12. The promoter for SAG39 (P(SAG39)) was isolated, and SAG39 expression was determined to be relatively low in mature leaves, while not expressed in the endosperm. SAG39 mRNA levels increased as senescence progressed, with maximum accumulation of transcripts at late senescence stages. Gel retardation assays indicated that two cis-acting elements in P(SAG39), HBOXCONSENSUSPVCHS and WRKY71OS, responded to leaf senescence. To test if P(SAG39) could be useful for increasing rice yields by increasing cytokinin content and delaying senescence, homozygous transgenic plants were obtained by linking P(SAG39) to the ipt gene and introducing it into Zhonghua 11. The chlorophyll level of the flag leaf was used to monitor senescence, confirming the stay-green phenotype in P(SAG39):ipt transgenic rice versus wild-type plants. Changes in the cytokinin content led to early flowering and a greater number of emerged panicles 70 d after germination in the transgenic rice. Measurements of sugar and nitrogen contents in flag leaves demonstrated a transition in the source-sink relationship in transgenic plants triggered at the onset of leaf senescence, with the nitrogen content decreasing more slowly, while sugars were removed more rapidly than in wild-type plants. The importance of these changes to rice physiology, yield, and early maturation will be discussed.
20443025	Changes in nitrogen assimilation, metabolism, and growth in transgenic rice plants expressing a fungal NADP(H)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA).	2010	Planta	In plants, glutamine synthetase (GS) is the enzyme that is mainly responsible for the assimilation of ammonium. Conversely, in microorganisms such as bacteria and Ascomycota, NADP(H)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and GS both have important roles in ammonium assimilation. Here, we report the changes in nitrogen assimilation, metabolism, growth, and grain yield of rice plants caused by an ectopic expression of NADP(H)-GDH (gdhA) from the fungus Aspergillus niger in the cytoplasm. An investigation of the kinetic properties of purified recombinant protein showed that the fungal gdhA had 5.4-10.2 times higher V(max) value and 15.9-43.1 times higher K(m) value for NH(4)(+), compared with corresponding values for rice cytosolic GS as reported in the literature. These results suggested that the introduction of fungal GDH into rice could modify its ammonium assimilation pathway. We therefore expressed gdhA in the cytoplasm of rice plants. NADP(H)-GDH activities in the gdhA-transgenic lines were markedly higher than those in a control line. Tracer experiments by feeding with (15)NH(4)(+) showed that the introduced gdhA, together with the endogenous GS, directly assimilated NH(4)(+) absorbed from the roots. Furthermore, in comparison with the control line, the transgenic lines showed an increase in dry weight and nitrogen content when sufficient nitrogen was present, but did not do so under low-nitrogen conditions. Under field condition, the transgenic line examined showed a significant increase in grain yield in comparison with the control line. These results suggest that the introduction of fungal gdhA into rice plants could lead to better growth and higher grain yield by enhancing the assimilation of ammonium.
20409004	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB.	2010	Plant J	Plants recognize environmental factors to determine flowering time. CONSTANS (CO) plays a central role in the photoperiod flowering pathway of Arabidopsis, and CO protein stability is modulated by photoreceptors. In rice, Hd1, an ortholog of CO, acts as a flowering promoter, and phytochromes repress Hd1 expression. Here, we investigated the functioning of OsCOL4, a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family in rice. OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days. In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment. Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants. This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1. By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways. In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB. We also present evidence for two independent pathways through which OsPhyB controls flowering time. These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1.
20574667	Expression of ethylene response factor JERF1 in rice improves tolerance to drought.	2010	Planta	Ethylene response factor (ERF) proteins regulate a variety of stress responses in plant. JERF1, a tomato ERF protein, can be induced by abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of JERF1 enhanced the tolerance of transgenic tobacco to high salt concentration, osmotic stress, and low temperature by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes by binding to DRE/CRT and GCC-box cis-elements. In this research, we further report that overexpression of JERF1 significantly enhanced drought tolerance of transgenic rice. The overexpression activated the expression of stress-responsive genes and increased the synthesis of the osmolyte proline by regulating the expression of OsP5CS, encoding the proline biosynthesis key enzyme deltal-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase. JERF1 also activated the expression of two ABA biosynthesis key enzyme genes, OsABA2 and Os03g0810800, and increased the synthesis of ABA in rice. Analysis of cis-elements of JERF1-targeted genes pointed to the existence of DRE/CRT and/or GCC box in their promoters, indicating that JERF1 could activate the expression of related genes in rice by binding to these cis-elements. Unlike some other ERF proteins, constructive overexpression of JERF1 did not change the growth and development of transgenic rice, which makes JEFR1 a potentially useful source in breeding for greater tolerance to abiotic stress.
20567981	Functional analysis of six drought-inducible promoters in transgenic rice plants throughout all stages of plant growth.	2010	Planta	There are few efficient promoters for use with stress-inducible gene expression in plants, and in particular for monocotyledonous crops. Here, we report the identification of six genes, Rab21, Wsi18, Lea3, Uge1, Dip1, and R1G1B that were induced by drought stress in rice microarray experiments. Gene promoters were linked to the gfp reporter and their activities were analyzed in transgenic rice plants throughout all stages of plant growth, from dry seeds to vegetative tissues to flowers, both before and after drought treatments. In fold induction levels, Rab21 and Wsi18 promoters ranged from 65- and 36-fold in leaves to 1,355- and 492-fold in flowers, respectively, whereas Lea3 and Uge1 were higher in leaves, but lower in roots and flowers, as compared with Rab21 and Wsi18. Dip1 and R1G1B promoters had higher basal levels of activity under normal growth conditions in all tissues, resulting in smaller fold-induction levels than those of the others. In drought treatment time course, activities of Dip1 and R1G1B promoters rapidly increased, peaked at 2 h, and remained constant until 8 h, while that of Lea3 slowly yet steadily increased until 8 h. Interestingly, Rab21 activity increased rapidly and steadily in response to drought stress until expression peaked at 8 h. Thus, we have isolated and characterized six rice promoters that are all distinct in fold induction, tissue specificity, and induction kinetics under drought conditions, providing a variety of drought-inducible promoters for crop biotechnology.
20549230	Overexpression of the rice carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 gene in Golden Rice endosperm suggests apocarotenoids as substrates in planta.	2010	Planta	Carotenoids are converted by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases that catalyze oxidative cleavage reactions leading to apocarotenoids. However, apocarotenoids can also be further truncated by some members of this enzyme family. The plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) subfamily is known to degrade both carotenoids and apocarotenoids in vitro, leading to different volatile compounds. In this study, we investigated the impact of the rice CCD1 (OsCCD1) on the pigmentation of Golden Rice 2 (GR2), a genetically modified rice variety accumulating carotenoids in the endosperm. For this purpose, the corresponding cDNA was introduced into the rice genome under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter in sense and anti-sense orientations. Despite high expression levels of OsCCD1 in sense plants, pigment analysis revealed carotenoid levels and patterns comparable to those of GR2, pleading against carotenoids as substrates in rice endosperm. In support, similar carotenoid contents were determined in anti-sense plants. To check whether OsCCD1 overexpressed in GR2 endosperm is active, in vitro assays were performed with apocarotenoid substrates. HPLC analysis confirmed the cleavage activity of introduced OsCCD1. Our data indicate that apocarotenoids rather than carotenoids are the substrates of OsCCD1 in planta.
20363869	Analysis of five novel putative constitutive gene promoters in transgenic rice plants.	2010	J Exp Bot	Novel constitutive gene promoters are essential components of crop biotechnology. Our analysis of five such promoters, APX, SCP1, PGD1, R1G1B, and EIF5, in transgenic rice plants is reported here. The five promoter regions were linked to the gfp reporter gene and transformed into rice. Using fluorescent microscopy and q-RT-PCR, promoter activities were analysed in comparison with OsCc1, Act1, and ZmUbi1, previously characterized as strong constitutive promoters. The APX and PGD1 promoters direct high levels of gene expression in all tissues and stages, producing GFP at levels of up to 1.3% of the total soluble protein. PGD1 is particularly active in flowers and mature roots. The R1G1B is active in the whole grain including the embryo, endosperm, and aleurone layer, and thus represents a constitutive promoter with activity in whole seeds that has not been described previously. The ZmUbi1 and R1G1B promoters are markedly less active in young roots and mature leaves whilst the APX, PGD1, OsCc1, and Act1 promoters are highly active in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. Overall, our results demonstrate that APX, PGD1, and R1G1B are novel gene promoters that are highly active at all stages of plant growth with distinct levels of activity.
19061530	A novel bacterial blight resistance gene from Oryza nivara mapped to 38 kb region on chromosome 4L and transferred to Oryza sativa L.	2008	Genet Res (Camb)	Bacterial blight (BB) of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) is one of the major constraints to productivity in South-East Asia. The strategy of using major genes, singly or in combination, continues to be the most effective approach for BB management. Currently, more than two dozen genes have been designated but not all the known genes are effective against all the prevalent pathotypes. The challenge, therefore, is to continue to expand the gene pool of effective and potentially durable resistance genes. Wild species constitute an important reservoir of the resistance genes including BB. An accession of Oryza nivara (IRGC 81825) was found to be resistant to all the seven Xoo pathotypes prevalent in northern states of India. Inheritance and mapping of resistance in O. nivara was studied by using F2, BC2F2, BC3F1 and BC3F2 progenies of the cross involving Oryza sativa cv PR114 and the O. nivara acc. 81825 using the most virulent Xoo pathotype. Genetic analysis of the segregating progenies revealed that the BB resistance in O. nivara was conditioned by a single dominant gene. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of F2 population using 191 polymorphic SSR markers identified a approximately 35 centiMorgans (cM) chromosomal region on 4L, bracketed by RM317 and RM562, to be associated with BB resistance. Screening of BC3F1 and BC2F2 progenies and their genotyping with more than 30 polymorphic SSR markers in the region, covering Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone OSJNBb0085C12, led to mapping of the resistance gene between the STS markers based on annotated genes LOC_Os04g53060 and LOC_Os04g53120, which is approximately 38.4 kb. Since none of the known Xa genes, which are mapped on chromosome 4L, are effective against the Xoo pathotypes tested, the BB resistance gene identified and transferred from O. nivara is novel and is tentatively designated as Xa30(t). Homozygous resistant BC3F3 progenies with smallest introgression region have been identified.
21410466	Differentiation in wild-type allele of the sd1 locus concerning culm length between indica and japonica subspecies of Oryza sativa (rice).	2011	Hereditas	A dwarfing gene (allele) sd1-d has been intensively utilized to develop short-culm indica varieties in southeast Asia up to now. Before the first sd1-d-carrying variety IR8 was released, rice researchers had recognized the general tendency that culm length is higher in indica varieties than in temperate-japonica ones. Inter-subspecific difference of the tall (wild-type) allele SD1 at the sd1 locus was examined on the common genetic background, using five isogenic lines developed by substituting sd1-d of the recurrent parent IR36 by SD1s of two indica varieties, two temperate-japonica varieties and one tropical-japonica variety. The two indica -donor isogenic lines had longer culms than the three japonica-donor isogenic lines consistently in two different environmental conditions. Moreover, nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism between the two subspecies was detected at two sites in Exon 1 and Exon 3 of the sd1 locus. It is demonstrated that the inter-subspecific differentiation of SD1 contributes height difference between indica and japonica. The indica-originating and japonica-originating alleles at the sd1 locus were designated as SD1-in(t) and SD1-ja(t), respectively.
21212298	Dro1, a major QTL involved in deep rooting of rice under upland field conditions.	2011	J Exp Bot	Developing a deep root system is an important strategy for avoiding drought stress in rice. Using the 'basket' method, the ratio of deep rooting (RDR; the proportion of total roots that elongated through the basket bottom) was calculated to evaluate deep rooting. A new major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling RDR was detected on chromosome 9 by using 117 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the lowland cultivar IR64, with shallow rooting, and the upland cultivar Kinandang Patong (KP), with deep rooting. This QTL explained 66.6% of the total phenotypic variance in RDR in the RILs. A BC(2)F(3) line homozygous for the KP allele of the QTL had an RDR of 40.4%, compared with 2.6% for the homozygous IR64 allele. Fine mapping of this QTL was undertaken using eight BC(2)F(3) recombinant lines. The RDR QTL Dro1 (Deeper rooting 1) was mapped between the markers RM24393 and RM7424, which delimit a 608.4 kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. To clarify the influence of Dro1 in an upland field, the root distribution in different soil layers was quantified by means of core sampling. A line homozygous for the KP allele of Dro1 (Dro1-KP) and IR64 did not differ in root dry weight in the shallow soil layers (0-25 cm), but root dry weight of Dro1-KP in deep soil layers (25-50 cm) was significantly greater than that of IR64, suggesting that Dro1 plays a crucial role in increased deep rooting under upland field conditions.
15659435	Rice plant development: from zygote to spikelet.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice is becoming a model plant in monocotyledons and a model cereal crop. For better understanding of the rice plant, it is essential to elucidate the developmental programs of the life cycle. To date, several attempts have been made in rice to categorize the developmental processes of some organs into substages. These studies are based exclusively on the morphological and anatomical viewpoints. Recent advancement in genetics and molecular biology has given us new aspects of developmental processes. In this review, we first describe the phasic development of the rice plant, and then describe in detail the developmental courses of major organs, leaf, root and spikelet, and specific organs/tissues. Also, for the facility of future studies, we propose a staging system for each organ.
20198467	Identification of a second major resistance gene to Rice yellow mottle virus, RYMV2, in the African cultivated rice species, O. glaberrima.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is the most damaging rice-infecting virus in Africa. However, few sources of high resistance and only a single major resistance gene, RYMV1, are known to date. We screened a large representative collection of African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima) for RYMV resistance. Whereas high resistance is known to be very rare in Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), we identified 29 (8%) highly resistant accessions in O. glaberrima. The MIF4G domain of RYMV1 was sequenced in these accessions. Some accessions possessed the rymv1-3 or rymv1-4 recessive resistance alleles previously described in O. glaberrima Tog5681 and Tog5672, respectively, and a new allele, rymv1-5, was identified, thereby increasing the number of resistance alleles in O. glaberrima to three. In contrast, only a single allele has been reported in O. sativa. Markers specific to the different alleles of the RYMV1 gene were developed for marker-assisted selection of resistant genotypes for disease management. In addition, the presence of the dominant susceptibility allele (Rymv1-1) in 15 resistant accessions suggests that their resistance is under different genetic control. An allelism test involving one of those accessions revealed a second major resistance gene, i.e., RYMV2. The diversity of resistance genes against RYMV in O. glaberrima species is discussed in relation to the diversification of the virus in Africa.
20495564	OsSPL14 promotes panicle branching and higher grain productivity in rice.	2010	Nat Genet	Identification of alleles that improve crop production and lead to higher-yielding varieties are needed for food security. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus WFP (WEALTHY FARMER'S PANICLE) encodes OsSPL14 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14, also known as IPA1). Higher expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching and higher grain yield in rice. OsSPL14 controls shoot branching in the vegetative stage and is affected by microRNA excision. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the OsSLP14(WFP) allele to increase rice crop yield. Introduction of the high-yielding OsSPL14(WFP) allele into the standard rice variety Nipponbare resulted in increased rice production.
18997409	Biochemical and crystallographic characterization of the starch branching enzyme I (BEI) from Oryza sativa L.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Starch branching enzyme (SBE) catalyzes the cleavage of alpha-1.4-linkages and the subsequent transfer of alpha-1.4 glucan to form an alpha-1.6 branch point in amylopectin. We overproduced rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in Escherichia coli cells, and the resulting enzyme (rBEI) was characterized with respect to biochemical and crystallographic properties. Specific activities were calculated to be 20.8 units/mg and 2.5 units/mg respectively when amylose and amylopectin were used as substrates. Site-directed mutations of Tyr235, Asp270, His275, Arg342, Asp344, Glu399, and His467 conserved in the alpha-amylase family enzymes drastically reduced catalytic activity of rBEI. This result suggests that the structures of BEI and the other alpha-amylase family enzymes are similar and that they share common catalytic mechanisms. Crystals of rBEI were grown under appropriate conditions and the crystals diffracted to a resolution of 3.0 A on a synchrotron X-ray source.
20570652	Characterization of plant eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) genes: The essential role in embryogenesis and their differential expression in Arabidopsis and rice.	2010	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) is an essential component of ribosome biogenesis. In our present study, we characterize plant eIF6 genes for the first time. Although a single gene encodes eIF6 in yeast and animals, two genes were found to encode proteins homologous to animal and yeast eIF6 in Arabidopsis and rice, denoted At-eIF6;1 and At-eIF6;2, and Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2, respectively. Analysis of the yeast eif6 (tif6) mutant suggested that plant eIF6, at least in the case of At-eIF6;1, can complement the essential function of eIF6 in yeast. Evidence for the essential role of eIF6 in plants was also provided by the embryonic-lethal phenotype of the at-eif6;1 mutant. In contrast, At-eIF6;2 appears not to be essential due to its very low expression level and the normal growth phenotype of the eif6;2 mutants. Consistent with the putative role of plant eIF6 in ribosome biogenesis, At-eIF6;1 is predominately expressed in tissues where cell division actively proceeds under the control of intronic cis-regulatory elements. On the other hand, both Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2 are probably active genes because they are expressed at significant expression levels. Interestingly, the supply of ammonium nitrate as a plant nutrient was found to induce specifically the expression of Os-eIF6;2. Our present findings indicate that the eIF6 genes have differently evolved in plant and animal kingdoms and also in distinct plant species.
20576097	The mitochondrial gene orfH79 plays a critical role in impairing both male gametophyte development and root growth in CMS-Honglian rice.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has often been associated with abnormal mitochondrial open reading frames. The mitochondrial gene orfH79 is a candidate gene for causing the CMS trait in CMS-Honglian (CMS-HL) rice. However, whether the orfH79 expression can actually induce CMS in rice remains unclear.

RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed that the ORFH79 protein is mainly present in mitochondria of CMS-HL rice and is absent in the fertile line. To investigate the function of ORFH79 protein in mitochondria, this gene was fused to a mitochondrial transit peptide sequence and used to transform wild type rice, where its expression induced the gametophytic male sterile phenotype. In addition, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microspore, a reduced ATP/ADP ratio, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and a lower respiration rate in the transgenic plants were found to be similar to those in CMS-HL rice. Moreover, retarded growth of primary and lateral roots accompanied by abnormal accumulation of ROS in the root tip was observed in both transgenic rice and CMS-HL rice (YTA).

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the expression of orfH79 in mitochondria impairs mitochondrial function, which affects the development of both male gametophytes and the roots of CMS-HL rice.
20626916	Relationship, evolutionary fate and function of two maize co-orthologs of rice GW2 associated with kernel size and weight.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: In rice, the GW2 gene, found on chromosome 2, controls grain width and weight. Two homologs of this gene, ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5, have been found in maize. In this study, we investigated the relationship, evolutionary fate and putative function of these two maize genes.

RESULTS: The two genes are located on duplicated maize chromosomal regions that show co-orthologous relationships with the rice region containing GW2. ZmGW2-CHR5 is more closely related to the sorghum counterpart than to ZmGW2-CHR4. Sequence comparisons between the two genes in eight diverse maize inbred lines revealed that the functional protein domain of both genes is completely conserved, with no non-synonymous polymorphisms identified. This suggests that both genes may have conserved functions, a hypothesis that was further confirmed through linkage, association, and expression analyses. Linkage analysis showed that ZmGW2-CHR4 is located within a consistent quantitative trait locus (QTL) for one-hundred kernel weight (HKW). Association analysis with a diverse panel of 121 maize inbred lines identified one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of ZmGW2-CHR4 that was significantly associated with kernel width (KW) and HKW across all three field experiments examined in this study. SNPs or insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels) in other regions of ZmGW2-CHR4 and ZmGW2-CHR5 were also found to be significantly associated with at least one of the four yield-related traits (kernel length (KL), kernel thickness (KT), KW and HKW). None of the polymorphisms in either maize gene are similar to each other or to the 1 bp InDel causing phenotypic variation in rice. Expression levels of both maize genes vary over ear and kernel developmental stages, and the expression level of ZmGW2-CHR4 is significantly negatively correlated with KW.

CONCLUSIONS: The sequence, linkage, association and expression analyses collectively showed that the two maize genes represent chromosomal duplicates, both of which function to control some of the phenotypic variation for kernel size and weight in maize, as does their counterpart in rice. However, the different polymorphisms identified in the two maize genes and in the rice gene indicate that they may cause phenotypic variation through different mechanisms.
20631318	Identification and characterization of proteins involved in rice urea and arginine catabolism.	2010	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) production relies strongly on nitrogen (N) fertilization with urea, but the proteins involved in rice urea metabolism have not yet been characterized. Coding sequences for rice arginase, urease, and the urease accessory proteins D (UreD), F (UreF), and G (UreG) involved in urease activation were identified and cloned. The functionality of urease and the urease accessory proteins was demonstrated by complementing corresponding Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants and by multiple transient coexpression of the rice proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana. Secondary structure models of rice (plant) UreD and UreF proteins revealed a possible functional conservation to bacterial orthologs, especially for UreF. Using amino-terminally StrepII-tagged urease accessory proteins, an interaction between rice UreD and urease could be shown. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic urease activation complexes seem conserved despite limited protein sequence conservation for UreF and UreD. In plant metabolism, urea is generated by the arginase reaction. Rice arginase was transiently expressed as a carboxyl-terminally StrepII-tagged fusion protein in N. benthamiana, purified, and biochemically characterized (K(m) = 67 mm, k(cat) = 490 s(-1)). The activity depended on the presence of manganese (K(d) = 1.3 microm). In physiological experiments, urease and arginase activities were not influenced by the external N source, but sole urea nutrition imbalanced the plant amino acid profile, leading to the accumulation of asparagine and glutamine in the roots. Our data indicate that reduced plant performance with urea as N source is not a direct result of insufficient urea metabolism but may in part be caused by an imbalance of N distribution.
20639575	Functional analysis of the cucumisin propeptide as a potent inhibitor of its mature enzyme.	2010	J Biol Chem	Cucumisin is a subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase) that is found in the juice of melon fruits (Cucumis melo L.). It is synthesized as a preproprotein consisting of a signal peptide, NH(2)-terminal propeptide, and 67-kDa protease domain. We investigated the role of this propeptide (88 residues) in the cucumisin precursor. Complementary DNAs encoding the propeptides of cucumisin, two other plant subtilases (Arabidopsis ARA12 and rice RSP1), and bacterial subtilisin E were expressed in Escherichia coli independently of their mature enzymes. The cucumisin propeptide strongly inhibited cucumisin in a competitive manner with a K(i) value of 6.2 ± 0.55 nm. Interestingly, cucumisin was also strongly inhibited by ARA12 and RSP1 propeptides but not by the subtilisin E propeptide. In contrast, the propeptides of cucumisin, ARA12, and RSP1 did not inhibit subtilisin. Deletion analysis clearly showed that two hydrophobic regions, Asn(32)-Met(38) and Gly(97)-Leu(103), in the cucumisin propeptide were important for its inhibitory activity. Site-directed mutagenesis also confirmed the role of a Val(36)-centerd hydrophobic cluster within the Asn(32)-Met(38) region in cucumisin inhibition. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the cucumisin propeptide had a secondary structure without a cognate protease domain and that the thermal unfolding of the propeptide at 90 °C was only partial and reversible. A tripeptide, Ile(35)-Val(36)-Tyr(37), in the Asn(32)-Met(38) region was thought to contribute toward the formation of a proper secondary structure necessary for cucumisin inhibition. This is the first report on the function and structural information of the propeptide of a plant serine protease.
20652591	Impact of genomic environment on mitochondrial rps7 mRNA features in grasses.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	The mitochondrial genomes of flowering plants are highly recombinogenic and this can lead to altered transcriptional units, even between closely related species. We are interested in the effects that DNA rearrangements have on the generation of mature mRNAs, and to this end we have determined the termini of mitochondrial S7 ribosomal protein (rps7) mRNAs from selected grasses, using circularized-RT-PCR. Although the rps7 mRNAs show a similar size of about 750 nt by northern hybridization analysis and have virtually identical 3' UTRs, their 5' terminal extremities differ among plant species, and this is attributable to genome rearrangements in some but not all cases. In wheat, rice, and barley, the 5' ends are homogeneous for each plant but map to non-homologous sites among the three species. In contrast, the rye, brome and Lolium 5' ends are quite heterogeneous in length even though they are located within conserved genomic regions. Comparative sequence analysis suggests that certain grass lineages have retained an ancestral organization upstream of rps7 that includes a 170-bp block homologous to sequences preceding several other mitochondrial genes, whereas others have undergone independent rearrangements at a recombination-prone site. Our analysis of mature rps7 transcripts revealed two non-silent RNA edits within the coding sequences, and also editing at several sites within the conserved 5' and 3' UTR regions in these plants, raising the possibility of their role in rps7 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Taken together, our observations illustrate the dynamic nature of upstream regulatory cis-elements for mitochondrial rps7 mRNA production in contrast to conservative 3' end-formation signals, during evolution in grasses.
20653414	Direct interaction between the Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) VPg and the central domain of the rice eIF(iso)4G1 factor correlates with rice susceptibility and RYMV virulence.	2010	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The adaptation of Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) to recessive resistance mediated by the rymv1-2 allele has been reported as a model to study the emergence and evolution of virulent variants. The resistance and virulence factors have been identified as eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4G1 and viral genome-linked protein (VPg), respectively, but the molecular mechanisms involved in their interaction are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated a direct interaction between RYMV VPg and the central domain of rice eIF(iso)4G1 both in vitro, using recombinant proteins, and in vivo, using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Insertion of the E309K mutation in eIF(iso)4G1, conferring resistance in planta, strongly diminished the interaction with avirulent VPg. The efficiency of the major virulence mutations at restoring the interaction with the resistance protein was assessed. Our results explain the prevalence of virulence mutations fixed during experimental evolution studies and are consistent with the respective viral RNA accumulation levels of avirulent and virulent isolates. Our results also explain the origin of the residual multiplication of wild-type isolates in rymv1-2-resistant plants and the role of genetic context in the poor adaptability of the S2/S3 strain. Finally, the strategies of RYMV and members of family Potyviridae to overcome recessive resistance were compared.
20719766	Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Root nodule (RN) symbiosis in legumes shares genes involved in the early signaling pathway with more ancient arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis, which is widespread in higher plants. The non-legume homologs of such genes have been well documented to be not only essential for the AM symbiosis in non-legume mycorrhizal plants but also functional in the RN symbiosis in legume plants. In contrast, it has not been investigated in detail whether RN symbiosis-specific genes, which are not essential for AM symbiosis, are functionally conserved in non-legumes. Two GRAS-domain transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2, have been shown to be required for RN symbiosis, but not for AM symbiosis. In this study, we demonstrated that their homologs, OsNSP1 and OsNSP2, from rice are able to fully rescue the RN symbiosis-defective phenotypes of the mutants of corresponding genes in the model legume, Lotus japonicus. Our results indicate that some of the genes essential for RN symbiosis conserve their functions in homologs from non-legumes, which do not nodulate.
20739304	AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	OsPti1a, a functional ortholog of tomato SlPti1, negatively regulates both basal resistance and R-gene-mediated resistance in rice. To investigate the molecular function of OsPti1a in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with OsPti1a using a yeast two-hybrid system. One of the interacting proteins is a Ser/Thr kinase that directly phosphorylates OsPti1a in vitro. This protein belongs to the AGC kinase family and is highly similar to AtOxi1, which is induced in response to a wide range of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating stimuli in Arabidopsis. Thus, it was designated OsOxi1. OsOxi1 was transiently phosphorylated in response to ROS and chitin elicitor. Both OsOxi1-overexpressing transgenic lines and the ospti1a mutant were highly sensitive to ROS treatment, indicating that OsOxi1 and OsPti1a are involved in ROS-mediated signaling in opposing ways. OsOxi1 is specifically expressed at infection sites where ROS are produced after inoculation with a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of OsOxi1 enhanced basal resistance to the blast fungus, indicating that OsOxi1 positively regulates disease resistance. OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), suggesting that the phosphorylation of OsPti1a by OsOxi1 is essential for basal resistance to Xoo. Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a-dependent inhibition of the responses.
20825165	Binding of β-D-glucosides and β-D-mannosides by rice and barley β-D-glycosidases with distinct substrate specificities.	2010	Biochemistry	Predominantly, rice Os3BGlu7 operates as a β-d-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), while barley HvBII acts as a β-d-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25). Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD NMR) and transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (trNOE) spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) modeling and docking at the 6-31+G* level were used to investigate binding of S- and O-linked gluco- and manno-configured aryl-β-d-glycosides to Os3BGlu7 and HvBII. Kinetic analyses with 4-nitrophenyl β-d-thioglucoside (4NP-S-Glc) and 4-nitrophenyl β-d-thiomannoside (4NP-S-Man) indicated that the inhibitions were competitive with apparent K(i) constants of 664 and 710 μM for Os3BGlu7 and 95 and 266 μM for HvBII, respectively. The STD NMR and trNOESY experiments revealed that 4NP-S-Glc and 4NP-S-Man bound weakly in (4)C(1) conformations to Os3BGlu7; 4NP-S-Glc adopted (3)S(5) (B(3,O)) or (1)S(3) ((1,4)B) conformations, and 4NP-S-Man preferred (4)C(1) geometry, when bound to HvBII. The QM modeling and docking, based on GLIDE scores, predicted that 4NP-O-Glc, 4NP-O-Man, and 4NP-S-Man bound preferentially in (1)S(3) geometries to both enzymes, contrary to 4NP-S-Glc that could also adopt a (4)C(1) conformation, although in a "flipped-down" ring position. The experimental and computational data suggested that in glycoside recognition and substrate specificity of Os3BGlu7 and HvBII, a combination of the following determinants is likely to play key roles: (i) the inherent conformational and spatial flexibilities of gluco- and manno-configured substrates in the enzymes' active sites, (ii) the subtle differences in the spatial disposition of active site residues and their capacities to form interactions with specific groups of substrates, and (iii) the small variations in the charge distributions and shapes of the catalytic sites.
20478969	Reversible association of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase with the thylakoid membrane depends upon the ATP level and pH in rice without heat stress.	2010	J Exp Bot	Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase (RCA) in the thylakoid membrane (TM) has been shown to play a role in protection and regulation of photosynthesis under moderate heat stress. However, the physiological significance of RCA bound to the TM (TM-RCA) without heat stress remains unknown. In this study, it is first shown, using experiments in vivo, that the TM-RCA varies in rice leaves at different development stages, under different environmental conditions, and in a rice mutant. Furthermore, it is shown that the amount of TM-RCA always increased when the Rubisco activation state and the pH gradient across the TM (DeltapH) decreased. It was then demonstrated in vitro that the RCA bound dynamically to TM and the amount of TM-RCA increased during Rubisco activation. A high level of ATP and a high pH value promoted the dissociation of RCA from the TM. Both the RCA association with and dissociation from the TM showed conformational changes related to the ATP level or pH as indicated by the changes in fluorescence intensity of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid (ANS) binding to RCA. These results suggest that the reversible association of RCA with the TM is ATP and pH (or DeltapH) dependent; it might be involved in the RCA activation of Rubisco, in addition to the previously discovered role in the protection and regulation of photosynthesis under heat stress.
20566563	A kinesin with calponin-homology domain is involved in premitotic nuclear migration.	2010	J Exp Bot	Interaction and cross-talk between microtubules and actin microfilaments are important for numerous processes during plant growth and development, including the control of cell elongation and tissue expansion, but little is known about the molecular components of this interaction. Plant kinesins with the calponin-homology domain (KCH) were recently identified and associated with a putative role in microtubule-microfilament cross-linking. The putative biological role of the rice KCH member OsKCH1 is addressed here using a combined approach with Tos17 kch1 knock-out mutants on the one hand, and a KCH1 overexpression line generated in tobacco BY-2 cells. It is shown that OsKCH1 is expressed in a development and tissue-specific manner in rice and antagonistic cell elongation and division phenotypes as a result of knock-down and overexpression are reported. Further, the dynamic repartitioning of OsKCH1 during the cell cycle is described and it is demonstrated that KCH overexpression delays nuclear positioning and mitosis in BY-2 cells. These findings are discussed with respect to a putative role of KCHs as linkers between actin filaments and microtubules during nuclear positioning.
20444225	Brittle Culm 12, a dual-targeting kinesin-4 protein, controls cell-cycle progression and wall properties in rice.	2010	Plant J	Kinesins are encoded by a large gene family involved in many basic processes of plant development. However, the number of functionally identified kinesins in rice is very limited. Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm12 (BC12), a gene encoding a kinesin-4 protein. bc12 mutants display dwarfism resulting from a significant reduction in cell number and brittleness due to an alteration in cellulose microfibril orientation and wall composition. BC12 is expressed mainly in tissues undergoing cell division and secondary wall thickening. In vitro biochemical analyses verified BC12 as an authentic motor protein. This protein was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and associated with microtubule arrays during cell division. Mitotic microtubule array comparison, flow cytometric analysis and expression assays of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in root-tip cells showed that cell-cycle progression is affected in bc12 mutants. BC12 is very probably regulated by CDKA;3 based on yeast two-hybrid and microarray data. Therefore, BC12 functions as a dual-targeting kinesin protein and is implicated in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and wall composition in the monocot plant rice.
20593223	Mutation in Wilted Dwarf and Lethal 1 (WDL1) causes abnormal cuticle formation and rapid water loss in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Epidermal cell layers play important roles in plant defenses against various environmental stresses. Here we report the identification of a cuticle membrane mutant, wilted dwarf and lethal 1 (wdl1), from a rice T-DNA insertional population. The mutant is dwarf and die at seedling stage due to increased rates of water loss. Stomatal cells and pavement cells are smaller in the mutant, suggesting that WDL1 affects epidermal cell differentiation. T-DNA was inserted into a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SGNH subfamily, within the GDSL lipase superfamily. The WDL1-sGFP signal coincided with the RFP signal driven by AtBIP-mRFP, indicating that WDL1 is an ER protein. SEM analyses showed that their leaves have a disorganized crystal wax layer. Cross-sectioning reveals loose packing of the cuticle and irregular thickness of cell wall. Detailed analyses of the epicuticular wax showed no significant changes either in the total amount and amounts of each monomer or in the levels of lipid polymers, including cutin and other covalently bound lipids, attached to the cell wall. We propose that WDL1 is involved in cutin organization, affecting depolymerizable components.
20600702	Genome-wide analysis of NAC transcription factor family in rice.	2010	Gene	We investigated 151 non-redundant NAC genes in rice and 117 in Arabidopsis. A complete overview of this gene family in rice is presented, including gene structures, phylogenies, genome localizations, and expression profiles. We also performed a comparative analysis of these genes in rice and Arabidopsis. Conserved amino acid residues and phylogeny construction using the NAC conserved domain sequence suggest that OsNAC gene family was classified broadly into two major groups (A and B) and sixteen subgroups in rice. We presented more specific phylogenetic analysis of OsNAC proteins based on the DNA-binding domain and known gene function, respectively. Loss of introns was observed in the segmental duplication. Homologous, paralogous, and orthologous searches of rice and Arabidopsis revealed that the major functional diversification within the NAC gene family predated the divergence of monocots and dicots. The chromosomal localizations of OsNAC genes indicated nine segmental duplication events involving 18 genes; 32 non-redundant OsNAC genes were involved in tandem duplications. Expression levels of this gene family were checked under various abiotic stresses (cold, drought, submergence, laid-down submergence, osmotic, salinity and hormone) and biotic stresses [infection with rice viruses such as RSV (rice stripe virus) and RTSV (rice tungro spherical virus)]. Biotic stresses are novel work and increase the possibilities for finding the best candidate genes. A preliminary search based on our microarray (22K and 44K) data suggested that more than 45 and 26 non-redundant genes in this family were upregulated in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively. All of the genes were further investigated for their stress responsiveness by RT-PCR analysis. Six genes showed preferential expression under both biotic RSV and RTSV stress. Eleven genes were upregulated by at least three abiotic treatments. Our study provides a very useful reference for cloning and functional analysis of members of this gene family in rice.
20581303	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice.	2010	Plant Cell	Temporal and spatial variation in the levels of and sensitivity to hormones are essential for the development of higher organisms. Traditionally, end-product feedback regulation has been considered as the key mechanism for the achievement of cellular homeostasis. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive1. Binding of these hormones to the receptor activates BR signaling and eventually suppresses BR synthesis. This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor. Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback. Activation by RAVL1 was coordinated via E-box cis-elements in the promoters of the receptor and biosynthetic genes. Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis. Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis. This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways.
20852032	Characterization of the beta-carotene hydroxylase gene DSM2 conferring drought and oxidative stress resistance by increasing xanthophylls and abscisic acid synthesis in rice.	2010	Plant Physiol	Drought is a major limiting factor for crop production. To identify critical genes for drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant, dsm2. The mutant phenotype was caused by a T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a putative β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH). BCH is predicted for the biosynthesis of zeaxanthin, a carotenoid precursor of abscisic acid (ABA). The amounts of zeaxanthin and ABA were significantly reduced in two allelic dsm2 mutants after drought stress compared with the wild type. Under drought stress conditions, the mutant leaves lost water faster than the wild type and the photosynthesis rate, biomass, and grain yield were significantly reduced, whereas malondialdehyde level and stomata aperture were increased in the mutant. The mutant is also hypersensitive to oxidative stresses. The mutant had significantly lower maximal efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry and nonphotochemical quenching capacity than the wild type, indicating photoinhibition in photosystem II and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. Overexpression of DSM2 in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to drought and oxidative stresses and increases of the xanthophylls and nonphotochemical quenching. Some stress-related ABA-responsive genes were up-regulated in the overexpression line. DSM2 is a chloroplast protein, and the response of DSM2 to environmental stimuli is distinctive from the other two BCH members in rice. We conclude that the DSM2 gene significantly contributes to control of the xanthophyll cycle and ABA synthesis, both of which play critical roles in the establishment of drought resistance in rice.
20862512	High-affinity nitrate uptake by rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles.	2011	J Plant Res	Nitrate uptake by rice coleoptiles was evaluated using ¹⁵N-nitrate in relation to the expression of high-affinity nitrate uptake-related genes, OsNRT2s (OsNRT2.1-2.4) and OsNAR2s (OsNAR2.1 and 2.2). Apparent nitrate uptake by coleoptiles was about one-sixth of that by hydroponically cultured seedling roots. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsNRT2.1, a root-specific key gene of inducible high-affinity transport system for nitrate, was most strongly induced in coleoptiles following nitrate supply initiation, while other OsNRT2s and OsNAR2s showed modest induction. These results suggest that rice coleoptiles may have high-affinity transport systems for nitrate similar to roots, and can be model organs for nutrient uptake by submerged plant shoots.
20872132	Dissecting quantitative resistance against blast disease using heterogeneous inbred family lines in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	SHZ-2 is an indica rice cultivar that exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast; it is widely used as a resistance donor in breeding programs. To dissect the QTL responsible for broad-spectrum blast resistance, we crossed SHZ-2 to TXZ-13, a blast susceptible indica variety, to produce 244 BC(4)F(3) lines. These lines were evaluated for blast resistance in greenhouse and field conditions. Chromosomal introgressions from SHZ-2 into the TXZ-13 genome were identified using a single feature polymorphism microarray, SSR markers and gene-specific primers. Segregation analysis of the BC(4)F(3) population indicated that three regions on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9, designated as qBR2.1, qBR6.1, and qBR9.1, respectively, was associated with blast resistance and contributed 16.2, 14.9, and 22.3%, respectively, to the phenotypic variance of diseased leaf area (DLA). We further narrowed the three QTL regions using pairs of sister lines extracted from heterogeneous inbred families (HIF). Pairwise comparison of these lines enabled the determination of the relative contributions of individual QTL. The qBR9.1 conferred strong resistance, whereas qBR2.1 or qBR6.1 individually did not reduce disease under field conditions. However, when qBR2.1 and qBR6.1 were combined, they reduced disease by 19.5%, suggesting that small effect QTLs contribute to reduction of epidemics. The qBR6.1 and qBR9.1 regions contain nucleotide-binding sites and leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRR) sequences, whereas the qBR2.1 did not. In the qBR6.1 region, the patterns of expression of adjacent NBS-LRR genes were consistent in backcross generations and correlated with blast resistance, supporting the hypothesis that multiple resistance genes within a QTL region can contribute to non-race-specific quantitative resistance.
20872210	Two complementary recessive genes in duplicated segments control etiolation in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	The main objective of this study was to identify the genes causing etiolation in a rice mutant, the thylakoids of which were scattered. Three populations were employed to map the genes for etiolation using bulked segregant analysis. Genetic analysis confirmed that etiolation was controlled by two recessive genes, et11 and et12, which were fine mapped to an approximately 147-kb region and an approximately 209-kb region on the short arms of chromosomes 11 and 12, respectively. Both regions were within the duplicated segments on chromosomes 11 and 12. They possessed a highly similar sequence of 38 kb at the locations of a pair of duplicated genes with protein sequences very similar to that of HCF152 in Arabidopsis that are required for the processing of chloroplast RNA. These genes are likely the candidates for et11 and et12. Expression profiling was used to compare the expression patterns of paralogs in the duplicated segments. Expression profiling indicated that the duplicated segments had been undergone concerted evolution, and a large number of the paralogs within the duplicated segments were functionally redundant like et11 and et12.
20878142	Independent evolution of a new allele of F1 pollen sterility gene S27 encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 in Oryza nivara.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Loss of function of duplicated genes plays an important role in the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation. The widespread occurrence of gene duplication followed by rapid loss of function of some of the duplicate gene copies suggests the independent evolution of loss-of-function alleles of duplicate genes in divergent lineages of speciation. Here, we found a novel loss-of-function allele of S27 in the Asian annual wild species Oryza nivara, designated S27-niv (s), that leads to F(1) pollen sterility in a cross between O. sativa and O. nivara. Genetic linkage analysis and complementation analysis demonstrated that S27-niv (s) lies at the same locus as the previously identified S27 locus and S27-niv (s) is a loss-of-function allele of S27. S27-niv (s) is composed of two tandem mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 genes (mtRPL27a and mtRPL27b), both of which are inactive. The coding and promoter regions of S27-niv (s) showed a number of nucleotide differences from the functional S27-T65 (+) allele. The structure of S27-niv (s) is different from that of a previously identified null S27 allele, S27-glum (s), in the South American wild rice species O. glumaepatula, in which mtRPL27a and mtRPL27b are absent. These results show that the mechanisms for loss-of-function of S27-niv (s) and S27-glum (s) are different. Our results provide experimental evidence that different types of loss-of-function alleles are distributed in geographically and phylogenetically isolated species and represent a potential mechanism for postzygotic isolation in divergent species.
20938764	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of ptgms2-1, the photoperiod-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) rice exhibits a number of desirable traits for hybrid rice production. The cloning genes responsible for PTGMS and those elucidating male sterility mechanisms and reversibility to fertility would be of great significance to provide a foundation to develop new male sterile lines. Guangzhan63S, a PTGMS line, is one of the most widely used indica two-line hybrid rice breeding systems in China. In this study, genetic analysis based on F(2) and BC(1)F(2) populations derived from a cross between Guangzhan63S and 1587, determined a single recessive gene controls male sterility in Guangzhan63S. Molecular marker techniques combined with bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) were used and located the target gene (named ptgms2-1) between two SSR markers RM12521 and RM12823. Fine mapping of the ptgms2-1 locus was conducted with 45 new Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers developed between the RM12521 and RM12823 region, using 634 sterile individuals from F(2) and BC(1)F(2) populations. Ptgms2-1 was further mapped to a 50.4 kb DNA fragment between two InDel markers, S2-40 and S2-44, with genetic distances of 0.08 and 0.16 cM, respectively, which cosegregated with S2-43 located on the AP004039 BAC clone. Ten genes were identified in this region based on annotation results from the RiceGAAS system. A nuclear ribonuclease Z gene was identified as the candidate for the ptgms2-1 gene. This result will facilitate cloning the ptgms2-1 gene. The tightly linked markers for the ptgms2-1 gene locus will further provide a useful tool for marker-assisted selection of this gene in rice breeding programs.
20940062	Ligand migration and hexacoordination in type 1 non-symbiotic rice hemoglobin.	2011	Biochim Biophys Acta	Type 1 non-symbiotic rice hemoglobin (rHb1) shows bis-histidyl heme hexacoordination and is capable of binding diatomic ligands reversibly. The biological function is as yet unclear, but the high oxygen affinity makes it unlikely to be involved in oxygen transport. In order to gain insight into possible physiological roles, we have studied CO rebinding kinetics after laser flash photolysis of rHb1 in solution and encapsulated in silica gel. CO rebinding to wt rHb1 in solution occurs through a fast geminate phase with no sign of rebinding from internal docking sites. Encapsulation in silica gel enhances migration to internal cavities. Site-directed mutagenesis of FB10, a residue known to have a key role in the regulation of hexacoordination and ligand affinity, resulted in substantial effects on the rebinding kinetics, partly inhibiting ligand exit to the solvent, enhancing geminate rebinding and enabling ligand migration within the internal cavities. The mutation of HE7, one of the histidyl residues involved in the hexacoordination, prevents hexacoordination, as expected, but also exposes ligand migration through a complex system of cavities. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein Dynamics: Experimental and Computational Approaches.
20974950	Linking differential domain functions of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Grain yield in many cereal crops is largely determined by grain size. Here we report the genetic and molecular characterization of GS3, a major quantitative trait locus for grain size. It functions as a negative regulator of grain size and organ size. The wild-type isoform is composed of four putative domains: a plant-specific organ size regulation (OSR) domain in the N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family cysteine-rich domain, and a von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) in the C terminus. These domains function differentially in grain size regulation. The OSR domain is both necessary and sufficient for functioning as a negative regulator. The wild-type allele corresponds to medium grain. Loss of function of OSR results in long grain. The C-terminal TNFR/NGFR and VWFC domains show an inhibitory effect on the OSR function; loss-of-function mutations of these domains produced very short grain. This study linked the functional domains of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice.
21041675	Structural basis for the one-pot formation of the diarylheptanoid scaffold by curcuminoid synthase from Oryza sativa.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Curcuminoid synthase (CUS) from Oryza sativa is a plant-specific type III polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes the remarkable one-pot formation of the C(6)-C(7)-C(6) diarylheptanoid scaffold of bisdemethoxycurcumin, by the condensation of two molecules of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and one molecule of malonyl-CoA. The crystal structure of O. sativa CUS was solved at 2.5-Å resolution, which revealed a unique, downward expanding active-site architecture, previously unidentified in the known type III PKSs. The large active-site cavity is long enough to accommodate the two C(6)-C(3) coumaroyl units and one malonyl unit. Furthermore, the crystal structure indicated the presence of a putative nucleophilic water molecule, which forms hydrogen bond networks with Ser351-Asn142-H(2)O-Tyr207-Glu202, neighboring the catalytic Cys174 at the active-site center. These observations suggest that CUS employs unique catalytic machinery for the one-pot formation of the C(6)-C(7)-C(6) scaffold. Thus, CUS utilizes the nucleophilic water to terminate the initial polyketide chain elongation at the diketide stage. Thioester bond cleavage of the enzyme-bound intermediate generates 4-coumaroyldiketide acid, which is then kept within the downward expanding pocket for subsequent decarboxylative condensation with the second 4-coumaroyl-CoA starter, to produce bisdemethoxycurcumin. The structure-based site-directed mutants, M265L and G274F, altered the substrate and product specificities to accept 4-hydroxyphenylpropionyl-CoA as the starter to produce tetrahydrobisdemethoxycurcumin. These findings not only provide a structural basis for the catalytic machinery of CUS but also suggest further strategies toward expanding the biosynthetic repertoire of the type III PKS enzymes.
21046066	A SNP in GmBADH2 gene associates with fragrance in vegetable soybean variety "Kaori" and SNAP marker development for the fragrance.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Fragrance in soybean is due to the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). BADH2 gene coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as the candidate gene responsible for fragrance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, using the RIL population derived from fragrant soybean cultivar "Kaori" and non-fragrant soybean cultivar "Chiang Mai 60" (CM60), STS markers designed from BADH2 homolog were found associating with 2AP production. Genetic mapping demonstrated that QTL position of fragrance and 2AP production coincides with the position of GmBADH2 (Glycine max betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2). Sequence comparison of GmBADH2 between Kaori and non-fragrant soybeans revealed non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 10. Nucleotide substitution of G to A in the exon results in an amino acid change of glycine (GGC; G) to aspartic acid (GAC; D) in Kaori. The amino acid substitution changes the conserved EGCRLGPIVS motif of GmBADH2, which is essential for functional activity of GmBADH2 protein, to EGCRLDPIVS motif, suggesting that the SNP in GmBADH2 is responsible for the fragrance in Kaori. Five single nucleotide-amplified polymorphism (SNAP) markers which are PCR-based allele specific SNP markers were developed for fragrance based on the SNP in GmBADH2. Two markers specific to A allele produced a band in only Kaori, while three markers specific to G alleles produced a band in only CM60. The simple PCR-based allele specific SNAP markers developed in the present study are useful in marker-assisted breeding of fragrant soybean.
21107518	Functional markers developed from multiple loci in GS3 for fine marker-assisted selection of grain length in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	The gene GS3 has major effect on grain size and plays an important role in rice breeding. The C to A mutation in the second exon of GS3 was reported to be functionally associated with enhanced grain length in rice. In the present study, besides the C-A mutation at locus SF28, three novel polymorphic loci, SR17, RGS1, and RGS2, were discovered in the second intron, the last intron and the final exon of GS3, respectively. A number of alleles at these four polymorphic loci were observed in a total of 287 accessions including Chinese rice varieties (Oryza sativa), African cultivated rice (O. glaberrima) and AA-genome wild relatives. The haplotype analysis revealed that the simple sequence repeats (AT)(n) at RGS1 and (TCC)(n) at RGS2 had differentiated in the wild rice whilst the C-A mutation occurred in the cultivated rice recently during domestication. It also indicated that A allele at SF28 was highly associated with long rice grain whilst various motifs of (AT)(n) at RGS1 and (TCC)(n) at RGS2 were mainly associated with medium to short grain in Chinese rice. The C-A mutation at SF28 explained 33.4% of the grain length variation in the whole rice population tested in this study, whereas (AT)(n) at RGS1 and (TCC)(n) at RGS2 explained 26.4 and 26.2% of the variation, respectively. These results would be helpful for better understanding domestication of GS3 and its manipulation for grain size in rice. The genic marker RGS1 based on the motifs (AT)(n) was further validated as a functional marker using two sets of backcross recombinant inbred lines. These results suggested that the functional markers developed from four different loci within GS3 could be used for fine marker-assisted selection of grain length in rice breeding.
21132425	Isolation, fine mapping and expression profiling of a lesion mimic genotype, spl(NF4050-8) that confers blast resistance in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	We evaluated a large collection of Tos17 mutant panel lines for their reaction to three different races of Magnaporthe oryzae and identified a lesion mimic mutant, NF4050-8, that showed lesions similar to naturally occurring spl5 mutant and enhanced resistance to all the three blast races tested. Nested modified-AFLP using Tos17-specific primers and southern hybridization experiments of segregating individuals indicated that the lesion mimic phenotype in NF4050-8 is most likely due to a nucleotide change acquired during the culturing process and not due to Tos17 insertion per se. Inheritance and genetic analyses in two japonica × indica populations identified an overlapping genomic region of 13 cM on short arm of chromosome 7 that was linked with the lesion mimic phenotype. High-resolution genetic mapping using 950 F(3) and 3,821 F(4) plants of NF4050-8 × CO39 delimited a 35 kb region flanked by NBARC1 (5.262 Mb) and RM8262 (5.297 Mb), which contained 6 ORFs; 3 of them were 'resistance gene related' with typical NBS-LRR signatures. One of them harbored a NB-ARC domain, which had been previously demonstrated to be associated with cell death in animals. Microarray analysis of NF4050-8 revealed significant up-regulation of numerous defense/pathogenesis-related genes and down-regulation of heme peroxidase genes. Real-time PCR analysis of WRKY45 and PR1b genes suggested possible constitutive activation of a defense signaling pathway downstream of salicylic acid but independent of NH1 in these mutant lines of rice.
21140255	Fine mapping of qSTV11TQ, a major gene conferring resistance to rice stripe disease.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	The indica rice cultivar, Teqing, shows a high level of resistance to rice stripe virus (RSV). It is believed that this resistance is controlled by the gene, qSTV11(TQ). For positional cloning of the resistance gene, a set of chromosome single segment substitution lines (CSSSLs) was constructed, all of which had the genetic background of the susceptible japonica cultivar, Lemont, with different single substituted segments of Teqing on chromosome 11. By identifying the resistance of the CSSSLs-2006 in a field within a heavily diseased area, the resistance gene qSTV11(TQ) was mapped between the markers Indel7 and RM229. Furthermore, in that region, six new markers were developed and 52 subregion CSSSLs (CSSSLs-2007) were constructed. The natural infection experiment was conducted again at different sites, with two replicates used in each site in order to identify the resistance phenotypes of the CSSSLs-2007 and resistant/susceptible controls in 2007. Through the results of 2007, qSTV11(TQ) was localized in a region defined by the markers, CAPs1 and Indel4. In order to further confirm the position of qSTV11(TQ), another set of subregion CSSSLs (CSSSLs-2009) was constructed. Finally, qSTV11(TQ) was localized to a 55.7 kb region containing nine annotated genes according to the genome sequence of japonica Nipponbare. The relationship between qSTV11(TQ) and Stvb-i (Hayano-Saito et al. in Theor Appl Genet 101:59-63, 2000) and the reliability of the markers used on both sides of qSTV11(TQ) for marker-assisted breeding of resistance to rice stripe disease are discussed.
21153625	The Pik-p resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice is mediated by a pair of closely linked CC-NBS-LRR genes.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	The blast resistance gene Pik-p, mapping to the Pik locus on the long arm of rice chromosome 11, was isolated by map-based in silico cloning. Four NBS-LRR genes are present in the target region of cv. Nipponbare, and a presence/absence analysis in the Pik-p carrier cv. K60 excluded two of these as candidates for Pik-p. The other two candidates (KP3 and KP4) were expressed in cv. K60. A loss-of-function experiment by RNAi showed that both KP3 and KP4 are required for Pik-p function, while a gain-of-function experiment by complementation test revealed that neither KP3 nor KP4 on their own can impart resistance, but that resistance was expressed when both were introduced simultaneously. Both Pikp-1 (KP3) and Pikp-2 (KP4) encode coiled-coil NBS-LRR proteins and share, respectively, 95 and 99% peptide identity with the two alleles, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS. The Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 sequences share only limited homology. Their sequence allowed Pik-p to be distinguished from Pik, Pik-s, Pik-m and Pik-h. Both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 were constitutively expressed in cv. K60 and only marginally induced by blast infection.
21156329	A soluble acid invertase is directed to the vacuole by a signal anchor mechanism.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Enzyme activities in the vacuole have an important impact on the net concentration of sucrose. In sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid), immunolabelling demonstrated that a soluble acid invertase (β-fructofuranosidase; EC 3.2.1.26) is present in the vacuole of storage parenchyma cells during sucrose accumulation. Examination of sequences from sugarcane, barley and rice showed that the N-terminus of the invertase sequence contains a signal anchor and a tyrosine motif, characteristic of single-pass membrane proteins destined for lysosomal compartments. The N-terminal peptide from the barley invertase was shown to be capable of directing the green fluorescent protein to the vacuole in sugarcane cells. The results suggest that soluble acid invertase is sorted to the vacuole in a membrane-bound form.
21156806	Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.	2011	J Biol Chem	Eukaryotic organisms have developed diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of iron, which is required for their survival. Graminaceous plants use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM1 and HvTOM1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA1 and ENA2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in graminaceous plants.
21161500	Association mapping of grain color, phenolic content, flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity in dehulled rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Phytochemicals such as phenolics and flavonoids in rice grain are antioxidants that are associated with reduced risk of developing chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits is necessary for the improvement of nutritional quality by breeding. Association mapping based on linkage disequilibrium has emerged as a powerful strategy for identifying genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying complex traits in plants. In this study, genome-wide association mapping using models controlling both population structure (Q) and relative kinship (K) were performed to identify the marker loci/QTLs underlying the naturally occurring variations of grain color and nutritional quality traits in 416 rice germplasm accessions including red and black rice. A total of 41 marker loci were identified for all the traits, and it was confirmed that Ra (i.e., Prp-b for purple pericarp) and Rc (brown pericarp and seed coat) genes were main-effect loci for rice grain color and nutritional quality traits. RM228, RM339, fgr (fragrance gene) and RM316 were important markers associated with most of the traits. Association mapping for the traits of the 361 white or non-pigmented rice accessions (i.e., excluding the red and black rice) revealed a total of 11 markers for four color parameters, and one marker (RM346) for phenolic content. Among them, Wx gene locus was identified for the color parameters of lightness (L*), redness (a*) and hue angle (H (o)). Our study suggested that the markers identified in this study can feasibly be used to improve nutritional quality or health benefit properties of rice by marker-assisted selection if the co-segregations of the marker-trait associations are validated in segregating populations.
21169347	Gene structures, classification and expression models of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	We identified 163 AP2/EREBP (APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein) genes in rice. We analyzed gene structures, phylogenies, domain duplication, genome localizations and expression profiles. Conserved amino acid residues and phylogeny construction using the AP2/ERF conserved domain sequence suggest that in rice the OsAP2/EREBP gene family can be classified broadly into four subfamilies [AP2, RAV (related to ABI3/VP1), DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein) and ERF (ethylene-responsive factor)]. The chromosomal localizations of the OsAP2/EREBP genes indicated 20 segmental duplication events involving 40 genes; 58 redundant OsAP2/EREBP genes were involved in tandem duplication events. There were fewer introns after segmental duplication. We investigated expression profiles of this gene family under biotic stresses [infection with rice viruses such as rice stripe virus (RSV), rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and rice dwarf virus (RDV, three virus strains S, O and D84)], and various abiotic stresses. Symptoms of virus infection were more severe in RSV infection than in RTSV and RDV infection. Responses to biotic stresses are novel findings and these stresses enhance the ability to identify the best candidate genes for further functional analysis. The genes of subgroup B-5 were not induced under abiotic treatments whereas they were activated by the three RDV strains. None of the genes of subgroups A-3 were differentially expressed by any of the biotic stresses. Our 44K and 22K microarray results suggest that 53 and 52 non-redundant genes in this family were up-regulated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, respectively. We further examined the stress responsiveness of most genes by reverse transcription-PCR. The study results should be useful in selecting candidate genes from specific subgroups for functional analysis.
21172955	UV radiation-responsive proteins in rice leaves: a proteomic analysis.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Depletion of stratospheric ozone has led to increased UV radiation reaching the surface of the Earth. This may damage plants. Using physiological, proteomic and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods, we systematically studied the response of 16-day-old rice seedlings to UV [0.67 W m(-2) biologically effective UVB (UVB(BE)) and 0.28 W m(-2) UVA] exposure for 6, 12 and 24 h. UV exposure resulted in the appearance of light brown patches on leaves, a decrease in the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), lipid peroxidation, accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds (including flavonoids and other phenolic pigments) and differential expression of 22 proteins. Both physiological and molecular responses became stronger with increasing UV exposure time, indicating the effects of UV accumulation on plants. UV-induced responses included (i) phytohormone-regulative responses (up-regulation of proteins related to phytohormone synthesis such as IAA and ethylene); (ii) injurious responses (photosynthesis suppression, lipid peroxidation and visible injury); and (iii) protective responses (accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds and differential expression of proteins involved in detoxification/antioxidation, defense, protein processing, RNA processing, carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism). The identification of UV-responsive proteins provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of plant responses to UV stress. Proteomic and qPCR analysis identified one up-regulated and two induced proteins with important functions: tryptophan synthase α chain (production of radical oxygen species), glyoxalase I (detoxification/antioxidation) and a Bet v I family protein (defense). These results will contribute to future research into their roles in UV stress responses in plants.
21205035	Methanol is an endogenous elicitor molecule for the synthesis of tryptophan and tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites upon senescence of detached rice leaves.	2011	Plant J	During senescence of detached rice leaves, tryptophan (Trp) and Trp-derived secondary metabolites such as serotonin and 4-coumaroylserotonin accumulated in concert with methanol (MeOH) production. This senescence-induced MeOH induction was closely associated with levels of pectin methylesterase (PME)1 mRNA and PME enzyme activity. Exogenous challenge of detached rice leaves with 1% MeOH accelerated Trp and serotonin biosynthesis with induction of the corresponding genes. No other solvents, including ethanol, resulted in a Trp-inducing effect. This MeOH-induced Trp synthesis was positively regulated by abscisic acid but negatively regulated by cytokinin, suggesting hormonal involvement in the action of MeOH. Endogenous overproduction or suppression of MeOH either by PME1 overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing revealed that PME1 overexpressing lines produced twofold higher Trp levels with elevated Trp biosynthetic gene expression, whereas RNAi lines showed twofold reduction in Trp level in healthy control rice leaves, suggesting that MeOH acts as an endogenous elicitor to enhance Trp biosynthesis. Among many transcription factors induced following MeOH treatment, the WRKY family showed significant induction patterns, of which WRKY14 appeared to play a key regulatory role in MeOH-induced Trp and Trp-derived secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
21205822	Nuclear/nucleolar GTPase 2 proteins as a subfamily of YlqF/YawG GTPases function in pre-60S ribosomal subunit maturation of mono- and dicotyledonous plants.	2011	J Biol Chem	The YlqF/YawG families are important GTPases involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell proliferation, or cell growth, however, no plant homologs have yet to be characterized. Here we isolated rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis nuclear/nucleolar GTPase 2 (OsNug2 and AtNug2, respectively) that belong to the YawG subfamily and characterized them for pre-60S ribosomal subunit maturation. They showed typical intrinsic YlqF/YawG family GTPase activities in bacteria and yeasts with k(cat) values 0.12 ± 0.007 min(-1) (n = 6) and 0.087 ± 0.002 min(-1) (n = 4), respectively, and addition of 60S ribosomal subunits stimulated their activities in vitro. In addition, OsNug2 rescued the lethality of the yeast nug2 null mutant through recovery of 25S pre-rRNA processing. By yeast two-hybrid screening five clones, including a putative one of 60S ribosomal proteins, OsL10a, were isolated. Subcellular localization and pulldown assays resulted in that the N-terminal region of OsNug2 is sufficient for nucleolar/nuclear targeting and association with OsL10a. OsNug2 is physically associated with pre-60S ribosomal complexes highly enriched in the 25S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNA, and its interaction was stimulated by exogenous GTP. Furthermore, the AtNug2 knockdown mutant constructed by the RNAi method showed defective growth on the medium containing cycloheximide. Expression pattern analysis revealed that the distribution of AtNug2 mainly in the meristematic region underlies its potential role in active plant growth. Finally, it is concluded that Nug2/Nog2p GTPase from mono- and didicotyledonous plants is linked to the pre-60S ribosome complex and actively processed 27S into 25S during the ribosomal large subunit maturation process, i.e. prior to export to the cytoplasm.
21209101	Plant carotene cis-trans isomerase CRTISO: a new member of the FAD(RED)-dependent flavoproteins catalyzing non-redox reactions.	2011	J Biol Chem	The carotene cis-trans isomerase CRTISO is a constituent of the carotene desaturation pathway as evolved in cyanobacteria and prevailing in plants, in which a tetra-cis-lycopene species, termed prolycopene, is formed. CRTISO, an evolutionary descendant of the bacterial carotene desaturase CRTI, catalyzes the cis-to-trans isomerization reactions leading to all-trans-lycopene, the substrate for the subsequent lycopene cyclization to form all-trans-α/β-carotene. CRTISO and CRTI share a dinucleotide binding motif at the N terminus. Here we report that this site is occupied by FAD in CRTISO. The reduced form of this cofactor catalyzes a reaction not involving net redox changes. Results obtained with C(1)- and C(5)-deaza-FAD suggest mechanistic similarities with type II isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI-2). CRTISO, together with lycopene cyclase CRTY and IDI-2, thus represents the third enzyme in isoprenoid metabolism belonging to the class of non-redox enzymes depending on reduced flavin for activity. The regional specificity and the kinetics of the isomerization reaction were investigated in vitro using purified enzyme and biphasic liposome-based systems carrying specific cis-configured lycopene species as substrates. The reaction proceeded from cis to trans, recognizing half-sides of the symmetrical prolycopene and was accompanied by one trans-to-cis isomerization step specific for the C(5)-C(6) double bond. Rice lycopene β-cyclase (OsLCY-b), when additionally introduced into the biphasic in vitro system used, was found to be stereospecific for all-trans-lycopene and allowed the CRTISO reaction to proceed toward completion by modifying the thermodynamics of the overall reaction.
21216027	Effect of magnesium deficiency on antioxidant status and cadmium toxicity in rice seedlings.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals and inhibits physiological processes of plants. Magnesium (Mg) is known as one of the essential nutrients for plants. Mg deficiency in plants affects metabolic processes. Plants grown in the field may encounter several abiotic stresses, rather than a single stress. Thus, the relationship between Mg nutrition and Cd toxicity is of ecological importance. In this study, effects of Mg deficiency on antioxidant systems and Cd toxicity in rice seedlings were investigated. Mg deficiency significantly decreased Mg concentrations in shoot and roots of rice seedlings. However, fresh weight and dry weight of rice seedlings were not affected by Mg deficiency. The contents of ascorbate and glutathione (GSH), the ratio of GSH/oxidized glutathione, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase in Mg-deficient leaves were higher than respective control leaves. Cd toxicity was judged by the decrease in biomass production, decrease in chlorophyll, and induction of oxidative stress. Based on these criteria, we demonstrated that Mg deficiency protected rice seedlings from Cd stress. Moreover, chlorophyll destruction by paraquat was higher in detached leaves from Mg-sufficient than Mg-deficient seedlings. Cd concentration was higher in Mg-deficient shoot and roots than their respective control shoot and roots, suggesting that the protective effect of Mg deficiency against Cd toxicity is not due to reduction of Cd uptake. Moreover, we observed that Cd-decreased Fe and Zn contents in Mg-deficient seedlings were more pronounced than that in Mg-sufficient seedlings. Of particular interest is the finding that the increase in OsIRT1, OsZIP1, and OsZIP3 transcripts caused by Cd in Mg-deficient roots was greater than that in control roots.
21219509	Transpositional landscape of the rice genome revealed by paired-end mapping of high-throughput re-sequencing data.	2011	Plant J	Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile entities that densely populate most eukaryotic genomes and contribute to both their structural and functional dynamics. However, most TE-related sequences in both plant and animal genomes correspond to inactive, degenerated elements, due to the combined effect of silencing pathways and elimination through deletions. One of the major difficulties in fully characterizing the molecular basis of genetic diversity of a given species lies in establishing its genome-wide transpositional activity. Here, we provide an extensive survey of the transpositional landscape of a plant genome using a deep sequencing strategy. This was achieved through paired-end mapping of a fourfold coverage of the genome of rice mutant line derived from an in vitro callus culture using Illumina technology. Our study shows that at least 13 TE families are active in this genotype, causing 34 new insertions. This next-generation sequencing-based strategy provides new opportunities to quantify the impact of TEs on the genome dynamics of the species.

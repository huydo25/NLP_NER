9426621	Maturation and translation mechanisms involved in the expression of a myb gene of rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated two overlapping cDNAs coding for a MYB-related protein expressed in aerobic and anaerobic rice (Oryza sativa) roots and coleoptiles. Analysis of their sequences reveals some peculiar features, suggesting the presence of post-transcriptional regulation events: an upstream ORF, two unspliced introns and a putative leucine zipper in the ORF coded by the unspliced RNA. Transient expression in protoplasts indicates that the upstream ORF inhibits expression of a downstream coding sequence. Finally, we demonstrated that anoxia, in roots, increases the ratio between the spliced and the unspliced mRNA and affects the expression of other myb-related genes.
14550537	Diversification and evolution of L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase.	2003	FEBS Lett	L-myo-Inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS, EC 5.5.1.4), the key enzyme in the inositol and phosphoinositide biosynthetic pathway, is present throughout evolutionarily diverse organisms and is considered an ancient protein/gene. Analysis by multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree generation and comparison of newly determined crystal structures provides new insight into the origin and evolutionary relationships among the various MIPS proteins/genes. The evolution of the MIPS protein/gene among the prokaryotes seems more diverse and complex than amongst the eukaryotes. However, conservation of a 'core catalytic structure' among the MIPS proteins implies an essential function of the enzyme in cellular metabolism throughout the biological kingdom.
10527423	Expression of two PIP genes in rapidly growing internodes of rice is not primarily controlled by meristem activity or cell expansion.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Membrane intrinsic proteins facilitate movement of small molecules often times functioning as water channels. We have identified two genes from rice which encode proteins with characteristic features of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP). They possess six membrane-spanning domains, an NPA repeat, overall high sequence homologies and characteristic C- and N-terminal hallmark motifs which allowed assignment of OsPIP1a to the PIP1 subfamily and of OsPIP2a to the PIP2 subfamily. OsPIP1a and OsPIP2a showed similar but not identical expression patterns. The two genes were expressed at higher levels in seedlings than in adult plants and expression in the primary root was regulated by light. In internodes of deepwater rice plants which were induced to grow rapidly by submergence, transcript levels were slightly induced in the intercalary meristem (IM) and slightly reduced in the elongation zone (EZ) after 18 h. In internodes of GA-induced excised stem sections transcript levels transiently declined in the IM and EZ after 1 h and subsequently recovered to elevated levels after 18 h. GA also induced OsPIP expression in non-growing tissue after 18 h. In the IM of submergence-induced stem sections transcript levels remained constitutive. The different growth-promoting treatments showed no direct correlation between growth rate and OsPIP gene expression in dividing or expanding cells. In fact, treatment of excised stem sections with ABA or drought stress induced similar changes in OsPIP expression in the growing zone during the first 6 h as GA did. We conclude that regulation of OsPIP1a and OsPIP2a expression is not primarily controlled by growth. GA-induced growth may however change the water status of cells which in turn results in altered PIP abundance.
15668792	Isolation and characterization of a Ds-tagged rice (Oryza sativa L.) GA-responsive dwarf mutant defective in an early step of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway.	2005	Plant Cell Rep	We have isolated a severe dwarf transposon (Ds) insertion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which could be differentiated early in the seedling stage by reduced shoot growth and dark green leaves, and later by severe dwarfism and failure to initiate flowering. These mutants, however, showed normal seed germination and root growth. One of the sequences flanking Ds, rescued from the mutant, was of a chromosome 4-located putative ent-kaurene synthase (KS) gene, encoding the enzyme catalyzing the second step of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway. Dwarf mutants were always homozygous for this Ds insertion and no normal plants homozygous for this mutation were recovered in the segregating progeny, indicating that the Ds insertion mutation is recessive. As mutations in three recently reported rice GA-responsive dwarf mutant alleles and the dwarf mutation identified in this study mapped to the same locus, we designate the corresponding gene OsKS1. The osks1 mutant seedlings were responsive to exogenous gibberellin (GA3). OsKS1 transcripts of about 2.3 kb were detected in leaves and stem of wild-type plants, but not in germinating seeds or roots, suggesting that OsKS1 is not involved in germination or root growth. There are at least five OsKS1-like genes in the rice genome, four of which are also represented in rice expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. All OsKS1-like genes are transcribed with different expression patterns. ESTs corresponding to all six OsKS genes are represented in other cereal databases including barley, wheat and maize, suggesting that they are biologically active.
2139168	Cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a rice 13 kDa prolamin.	1990	Mol Gen Genet	A cDNA library constructed from mRNAs obtained from developing rice endosperm was screened with a cDNA clone (lambda RM7) of highest frequency of occurrence (1.8%). The translation product directed by the mRNA which was hybrid-released from lambda RM7 cDNA in a wheat germ cell-free system showed a molecular size of 13 kDa when coexisting with the protein body fraction of developing maize endosperm. A polypeptide sequence composed of 156 amino acids was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. By comparison with the 19 N-terminal amino acids obtained from Edman degradation of the isolated rice 13 kDa prolamin fraction, the signal sequence was determined as consisting of 19 amino acids. The deduced polypeptide is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as Leu and Val, and also in Gln, but lacks Lys. Hence, the amino acid composition is consistent with that of rice 13 kDa prolamin. By homology with previously reported cereal prolamins, only a single octapeptide sequence, Gln-Gln-Gln-Cys-Cys-Gln-Gln-Leu, which was observed in 15 kDa and 27 kDa zein, B- and gamma-hordein, alpha/beta- and gamma-gliadin, and gamma-secalin was conserved in the rice 10 kDa and 13 kDa prolamin. No repetitive sequences and/or sequences homologous to other cereal prolamins, except the above octapeptide, were observed for the mature 13 kDa prolamin polypeptide. The signal sequence region of the 13 kDa prolamin, however, shows homology of more than 65% in both the nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence with rice 10 kDa prolamin and maize zein.
8865668	The phytochrome gene family in grasses (Poaceae): a phylogeny and evidence that grasses have a subset of the loci found in dicot angiosperms.	1996	Mol Biol Evol	The phytochrome nuclear gene family encodes photoreceptor proteins that mediate developmental responses to red and far red light throughout the life of the plant. From studies of the dicot flowering plant Arabidopsis, the family has been modeled as comprising five loci, PHYA-PHYE. However, it has been shown recently that the Arabidopsis model may not completely represent some flowering plant groups because additional PHY loci related to PHYA and PHYB of Arabidopsis apparently have evolved independently several times in dicots, and monocot flowering plants may lack orthologs of PHYD and PHYE of Arabidopsis. Nonetheless, the phytochrome nucleotide data were informative in a study of organismal evolution because the loci occur as single copy sequences and appear to be evolving independently. We have continued our investigation of the phytochrome gene family in flowering plants by sampling extensively in the grass family. The phytochrome nuclear DNA data were cladistically analyzed to address the following questions: (1) Are the data consistent with a pattern of differential distribution of phytochrome genes among monocots and higher dicots, with homologs of PHYA, B, C, D, and E present in higher dicots, but of just PHYA, B, and C in monocots, and (2) what phylogenetic pattern within Poaceae do they reveal? Results of these analyses, and of Southern blot experiments, are consistent with the observation that the phytochrome gene family in grasses comprises the same subset of loci detected in other monocots. Furthermore, for studies of organismal phylogeny in the grass family, the data are shown to provide significant support for relationships that are just weakly resolved by other data sets.
9787463	Isolation and characterization of two importin-beta genes from rice.	1998	Plant Cell Physiol	The nuclear transport of proteins is mediated by the complex of importin-alpha and importin-beta. We isolated two cDNAs encoding importin-beta from rice. A rice importin-beta was demonstrated to interact with rice GST-importin-alpha fusion proteins. The presence of two importin-beta genes was shown for the first time among a variety of eukaryotes.
1397289	Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding rice elongation factor 1 beta'.	1992	FEBS Lett	A cDNA clone coding for rice elongation factor 1 beta' (EF-1 beta') was isolated from a rice anther cDNA library. The clone, named RB', was 980 bp long and contained a single open reading frame coding for 223 amino acids; the first 31 amino acids, except for the first methionine, which is absent in the mature protein, are identical to those of the purified protein determined with a protein sequencer. The amino acid sequence of rice EF-1 beta' shows homology to the C-terminal half of Artemia salina EF-1 beta (59%) and human EF-1 beta (63%), but might not have a phosphorylation site for casein kinase II which has been conserved in Artemia saline EF-1 beta and EF-1 delta, human EF-1 beta and silkworm EF-1 beta'.
8307147	Cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding rice elongation factor 1 beta.	1994	FEBS Lett	We have cloned and sequenced a cDNA coding for rice elongation factor 1 beta (EF-1 beta). The clone was 1420 bp long and contained an open reading frame coding for 229 amino acids. The overall identity between rice EF-1 beta and rice EF-1 beta' [Matsumoto, S., Oizumi, N., Taira, H. and Ejiri, S. (1992) FEBS Lett. 311, 46-48] is 60% at the amino acid sequence level; a higher percent identical residues (81%) were especially observed in the C-terminal region. Rice EF-1 beta has no conserved phosphorylation site for casein kinase II and no leucine zipper motif, although these motifs are well conserved in EF-1 delta (= beta in plants) subunits of animal EF-1.
9747803	Characterization of the rice pathogen-related protein Rir1a and regulation of the corresponding gene.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), local acquired resistance against Pyricularia oryzae (Cav.), the causal agent of rice blast, can be induced by a preinoculation with the non-host pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. We have cloned a cDNA (Rir1a) and a closely related gene (Rir1b) corresponding to transcripts that accumulate in leaf tissue upon inoculation with P. syringae pv. syringae. The cDNA encodes a putative 107 amino acid protein, Rir1a, that exhibits a putative signal peptide cleavage site in its hydrophobic N-terminal part and a C-terminal part that is relatively rich in glycine and proline. The Rir1b gene contains a Tourist and a Wanderer miniature transposable element in its single intron and encodes a nearly identical protein. Rir1a is similar in sequence (ca. 35% identical and ca. 60% conservatively changed amino acids) to the putative Wir1 family of proteins that are encoded by pathogen-induced transcripts in wheat. Using antibodies raised against a Rir1a-fusion protein we show that Rir1a is secreted from rice protoplasts transiently expressing a 35S::Rir1a construct and that the protein accumulates in the cell wall compartment of rice leaves upon inoculation with P. syringae pv. syringae. Possible roles of Rir1a in pathogen defense are discussed.
11435398	Conservation of microstructure between a sequenced region of the genome of rice and multiple segments of the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana.	2001	Genome Res	The nucleotide sequence was determined for a 340-kb segment of rice chromosome 2, revealing 56 putative protein-coding genes. This represents a density of one gene per 6.1 kb, which is higher than was reported for a previously sequenced segment of the rice genome. Sixteen of the putative genes were supported by matches to ESTs. The predicted products of 29 of the putative genes showed similarity to known proteins, and a further 17 genes showed similarity only to predicted or hypothetical proteins identified in genome sequence data. The region contains a few transposable elements: one retrotransposon, and one transposon. The segment of the rice genome studied had previously been identified as representing a part of rice chromosome 2 that may be homologous to a segment of Arabidopsis chromosome 4. We confirmed the conservation of gene content and order between the two genome segments. In addition, we identified a further four segments of the Arabidopsis genome that contain conserved gene content and order. In total, 22 of the 56 genes identified in the rice genome segment were represented in this set of Arabidopsis genome segments, with at least five genes present, in conserved order, in each segment. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Arabidopsis genome has undergone multiple duplication events. Our results demonstrate that conservation of the genome microstructure can be identified even between monocot and dicot species. However, the frequent occurrence of duplication, and subsequent microstructure divergence, within plant genomes may necessitate the integration of subsets of genes present in multiple redundant segments to deduce evolutionary relationships and identify orthologous genes.
12372141	Long terminal repeat retrotransposons of Oryza sativa.	2002	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute a major fraction of the genomes of higher plants. For example, retrotransposons comprise more than 50% of the maize genome and more than 90% of the wheat genome. LTR retrotransposons are believed to have contributed significantly to the evolution of genome structure and function. The genome sequencing of selected experimental and agriculturally important species is providing an unprecedented opportunity to view the patterns of variation existing among the entire complement of retrotransposons in complete genomes.

RESULTS: Using a new data-mining program, LTR_STRUC, (LTR retrotransposon structure program), we have mined the GenBank rice (Oryza sativa) database as well as the more extensive (259 Mb) Monsanto rice dataset for LTR retrotransposons. Almost two-thirds (37) of the 59 families identified consist of copia-like elements, but gypsy-like elements outnumber copia-like elements by a ratio of approximately 2:1. At least 17% of the rice genome consists of LTR retrotransposons. In addition to the ubiquitous gypsy- and copia-like classes of LTR retrotransposons, the rice genome contains at least two novel families of unusually small, non-coding (non-autonomous) LTR retrotransposons.

CONCLUSIONS: Each of the major clades of rice LTR retrotransposons is more closely related to elements present in other species than to the other clades of rice elements, suggesting that horizontal transfer may have occurred over the evolutionary history of rice LTR retrotransposons. Like LTR retrotransposons in other species with relatively small genomes, many rice LTR retrotransposons are relatively young, indicating a high rate of turnover.
2101689	Structural characterization of a rice actin gene.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA clone containing information for the rice actin gene RAc1. Transcript terminus mapping and sequence alignment between the RAc1 cDNA clone and a previously isolated RAc1 genomic clone were used to determine the structure of the RAc1 gene. This allowed us to make the first complete structural characterization of a plant actin gene. The analysis revealed the presence of a 5'-noncoding exon, separated by an intron, from the first translated exon of the RAc1 gene. This is one of the few reported cases of a plant gene containing such a 5'-noncoding exon. Sequence comparison between the previously isolated plant actin genes suggests that such an exon may be a common feature of plant actin gene structure. The present study also confirms that the rice actin gene family is composed of at least eight unique members.
2136633	Isolation of an efficient actin promoter for use in rice transformation.	1990	Plant Cell	We have characterized the 5' region of the rice actin 1 gene (Act1) and show that it is an efficient promoter for regulating the constitutive expression of a foreign gene in transgenic rice. By constructing plasmids with 5' regions from the rice Act1 gene fused to the coding sequence of a gene encoding bacterial beta-glucuronidase, we demonstrate that a region 1.3 kilobases upstream of the Act1 translation initiation codon contains all of the 5'-regulatory elements necessary for high-level beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression in transient assays of transformed rice protoplasts. The rice Act1 primary transcript has a noncoding exon separated by a 5' intron from the first coding exon. Fusions that lack this Act1 intron showed no detectable GUS activity in transient assays of transformed rice protoplasts. Deletion analysis of the Act1 5' intron suggests that the intron-mediated stimulation of GUS expression is associated, in part, with an in vivo requirement for efficient intron splicing.
1753941	Construction of expression vectors based on the rice actin 1 (Act1) 5' region for use in monocot transformation.	1991	Mol Gen Genet	It has been previously reported that the 5' region of the rice actin 1 gene (Act1) promoted high-level expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (Gus) in transformed rice cells. In this paper we describe the construction of Act1-based expression vectors for use in monocot transformation. As part of the development of these vectors, we have evaluated the influence of the Act1 first intron, the Act1-Gus junction-encoded N-terminal amino acids, and the sequence context surrounding the Act1 and Gus translation initiation site on Act1-Gus gene expression in rice and maize cells. We have found that addition of Act1 intron 1 to the transcription unit of a Gus reporter gene under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter stimulated GUS activity more than 10-fold in transformed rice cells. Optimization of the sequence context around the Gus translation initiation site resulted in a 4-fold stimulation of Gus expression in transformed rice cells. By utilizing both the Act1 intron 1 and optimized Gus translation initiation site, a 40-fold stimulation in Gus expression from the CaMV 35S promoter has been achieved in transformed rice cells; very similar results were obtained in transformed maize cells. Taken together these results suggest that the Act1-based expression vectors described here should promote the expression of foreign genes in most, if not all, transformed monocot cells to levels that have not previously been attainable with alternative expression vectors.
14581626	Rice phospholipase D isoforms show differential cellular location and gene induction.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Phospholipase D (PLD) has emerged as an important enzyme involved in signal transduction, stress responses, protein trafficking, and membrane metabolism. This report describes the cloning and characterization of three novel PLD genes from rice, designated RPLD3, RPLD4 and RPLD5. The rice PLDs, including the previously isolated RPLD1 and RPLD2, are similar to PLD subfamilies of Arabidopsis: Based on sequence homology and domain conservation, RPLD1 is most similar to the PLDalpha subfamily of PLDs while RPLD5 most closely resembles the PLDdelta type. RPLD2, 3 and 4 represent a unique subfamily, although they are most similar to PLDalpha. RPLD1 is located on chromosome 1, RPLD5 on chromosome 3, and RPLD2, RPLD3, and RPLD4 are tandemly arrayed on chromosome 5. Transcriptional analysis reveals that RPLD1, present in healthy rice vegetative tissues, is induced rapidly but transiently in wounded leaf tissues. RPLD2, also induced by wounding, is present at lower levels but for a more prolonged duration than RPLD1. Immunolocalization with peptide specific antibodies to each of the five PLDs was used to demonstrate that the isoforms have overlapping but distinct patterns of distribution in healthy rice cells. RPLD1 was detected in mesophyll cell wall, membranes, and chloroplasts, whereas RPLD3 and RPLD4 were located predominantly in the chloroplasts. Labeling of RPLD2 and RPLD5 was sparse, and was most concentrated in the secondary walls of xylem (RPLD2) and guard cells (RPLD2 and RPLD5). This combined information on structural features, expression profiles, and cellular localization will assist the basis for dissection of PLD isoform function in rice.
8790293	Novel members of a family of AT hook-containing DNA-binding proteins from rice are identified through their in vitro interaction with consensus target sites of plant and animal homeodomain proteins.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The AT hook is an AT-rich DNA-binding domain that occurs three times in mammalian high-mobility-group I/Y chromosomal proteins and has recently also been identified in DNA-binding proteins from plants. We unexpectedly isolated three rice cDNA clones encoding AT hook-containing proteins in an attempt to isolate homeobox cDNA clones by south-western screening of an expression library with known binding sites for Arabidopsis and animal homeodomain proteins. One of these clones (Os-PF1) has previously been identified due to the binding of its encoded protein to PE1, a cis-acting element from the oat phytochrome promoter. The other two clones represent newly described cDNA clones, designated Os-AT1 and Os-AT2. The Os-AT1 and Os-AT2 proteins were found to have the same specificities as Os-PF1 with respect to in vitro binding of wild-type and mutant PE1 versions. However, all three proteins appeared to bind much stronger in south-western assays to two of the rather AT-rich sequences used in our screening than to the PE1 element. In none of the AT hook proteins clear homologies to transcriptional activation domains could be identified, but the N-terminal regions of Os-AT1 and Os-PF1 were found to show similarity to histone H1 chromosomal proteins. Given their structural characteristics it is conceivable that the rice AT hook proteins bind to gene promoter regions as accessory proteins that may alter the accessibility of chromatin to other nuclear factors. Their predominant expression in young and meristematic tissues suggests that the presence of the AT hook proteins may affect the expression of genes that determine the differentiation status of cells.
9076993	Transcriptional repression by Oshox1, a novel homeodomain leucine zipper protein from rice.	1997	Plant J	This paper describes the characterization of Oshox1, a cDNA clone from rice encoding a member of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class of putative transcription factors. Oshox1 maps to chromosome 10 and belongs to a family of related rice genes. Two-hybrid assays showed that Oshox1 protein can homodimerize, but can also form heterodimers with an Arabidopsis HD-Zip protein. This suggests that protein-protein interactions may also occur between different HD-Zip proteins in rice, which would provide enormous versatility for generating specific gene-control mechanisms. Oshox1 mRNA could be detected in various rice tissues at different developmental stages, with highest levels in embryos, shoots of seedlings, and leaves of mature plants. Transgenic expression of Oshox1 in Arabidopsis retarded growth and affected leaf size and shape, indicative of a role as developmental regulator. In vitro and in vivo DNA-binding studies revealed that Oshox1 interacts with the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG, confirming that the protein represents a transcription factor. Oshox1 was found to repress reporter gene activity in rice suspension cells, most likely by a mechanism of active transcriptional repression. Repression was strictly dependent on the presence of upstream Oshox1 binding sites in the reporter gene constructs and a function of the N-terminal region of Oshox1, preceding the homeodomain.
10732669	HD-Zip proteins of families I and II from rice: interactions and functional properties.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	Proteins of the closely related homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) families I and II in plants are putative transcription factors that interact with similar pseudopalindromic DNA recognition sites. We have previously described the Oshox1 gene from rice, which encodes an HD-Zip II protein. To identify further rice HD-Zip proteins, one-hybrid screens were performed in yeast strains containing a HIS3 reporter gene with upstream HD-Zip recognition sites. This resulted in the isolation of six new cDNAs encoding HD-Zip proteins belonging to family I (Oshox4, -5, -6) or family II (Oshox2, -3, -7). In transient assays, using rice suspension-cultured cells transformed by particle bombardment, we showed previously that Oshox1 can transcriptionally repress the activity of reporter gene constructs with upstream HD-Zip binding sites. Here, we confirm the repression properties of Oshox1 by showing that the repression function can be conferred on a heterologous DNA-binding domain. This portable functional domain (residues 1-155) is located proximal to the HD-Zip domain. In yeast, the same region of the Oshox1 protein was found to confer transcriptional activation instead of repression, pointing to the possibility that cell type-specific factors may determine the functional properties of the Oshox1 protein in rice. Like Oshox1, another HD-Zip family II protein (Oshox3) was also found to function as a transcriptional repressor in rice cells. In contrast, two HD-Zip I family proteins (Oshox4 and -5) appeared to act as activators in both rice and yeast cells. Results of two-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that all HD-Zip proteins of families I and II can form homodimers and also heterodimers with all HD-Zip proteins of the same family. Heterodimerization across the HD-Zip families I and II apparently does not to occur.
8759917	Submergence enhances expression of a gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase in deepwater rice.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	Partial submergence greatly stimulates internodal growth in deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.). Previous work has shown that the effect of submergence is, at least in part, mediated by ethylene, which accumulates in the air spaces of submerged internodes. To investigate the expression of the genes encoding ethylene biosynthetic enzymes during accelerated growth of deep water rice, we cloned a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase cDNA (OS-ACO1) from internodes of submerged plants and measured the activity of the enzyme in tissue extracts with an improved assay. We found an increase in ACC oxidase mRNA levels and enzyme activity after 4 to 24 h of submergence. Thus, it is likely that ethylene biosynthesis in internodes of deep water rice is controlled, at least in part, at the level of ACC oxidase.
8720923	Cloning and characterization of a probenazole-inducible gene for an intracellular pathogenesis-related protein in rice.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	Probenazole (3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) induces disease resistance in rice against rice blast fungus. To investigate the molecular mechanism of probenazole-induced resistance, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone of a probenazole-inducible gene in rice, which encoded a protein designated PBZ1. Sequence analysis revealed that significant homology at the amino acid level exists between the predicted PBZ1 protein and intracellular pathogenesis-related (IPR) proteins. Accumulation of PBZ1 mRNA was not induced by wounding, but markedly induced by inoculation with rice blast fungus. In addition, it was induced sooner by inoculation with an incompatible race than that with a compatible race. On the other hand, when the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was examined after treatment with probenazole-related compounds, it was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity. However, it was induced after treatment with N-cyano-methyl-2-chloro-isonicotinamide (NCI), which belongs to another group of compounds known to induce disease resistance. Thus, although the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity, our findings suggest that the PBZ1 gene has an important function during the disease resistance response in rice.
8287970	Cloning and sequence analysis of a cDNA encoding rice glutaredoxin.	1994	FEBS Lett	A full-length cDNA clone (RASC8) encoding glutaredoxin (thioltransferase) was isolated from a cDNA library of an aleurone layer prepared from a developing seed of rice (Oryza sativa L.). RASC8, 568bp in length, contained an ATG codon and two possible polyadenylation signals, and encoded 112 amino acid residues. Cys-Pro-Phe-Cys, which is the active site and a highly conserved sequence among thioltransferases, was found in the deduced amino acid sequence. RASC8 was introduced into an expression vector pMALc2 and the translated product possessed thioltransferase activity.
8424958	Nucleotide sequence of the gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase of rice and its deduced amino acid sequence.	1993	Biochim Biophys Acta	The whole structure of the gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase of rice, designated as GP-28, was determined. The gene included one intron located between nucleotides 557 and 2048, corresponding to the second and third letters, respectively, of the arginine codon at position 136 which is conserved in the genes of other plant species. The open reading frame was capable of encoding a 716 amino acid sequence, which showed 73.3% similarity with that of parsley. In the carboxyl-terminal region, an arginine-rich sequence common to the rice enzyme was found, which showed low similarity with those of dicot plants.
2806257	Structure and some characterization of the gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from rice plants.	1989	Eur J Biochem	A nearly full-length cDNA and a genomic clone were isolated that encoded the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of rice plants, and the complete nucleotide sequences were determined. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 701 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly similar to that of PAL from Phaseolus vulgaris deduced from an incomplete cDNA fragment. The cloned gene spans 4412 bp and consists of two exons and one intron. The site of initiation of transcription was located -86 nucleotides (position 1) upstream from the translational initiation codon by the primer-extension method. Sequences analogous to TATA-box and GC-box were found in the 5'-upstream region from the transcriptional initiation site. Southern blot analysis showed that the PAL gene of rice plants exists as a small multi-gene family. Within this family, the genomic clone isolated in this study was shown to be responsive by light. This also indicated that this genomic sequence functions as a gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in rice plants in vivo.
8759920	Two novel genes rapidly and transiently activated in suspension-cultured rice cells by treatment with N-acetylchitoheptaose, a biotic elicitor for phytoalexin production.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	By using subtracted probes, two cDNA clones of rice, EL2 and EL3, were isolated as genes responsive within 6 min to N-acetylchitoheptaose, a potent biotic elicitor for phytoalexin biosynthesis. Analyses of the sequence of the cDNAs showed that both of EL2 and EL3 encoded basic proteins with no significant similarities to those of known genes.
16172530	DNA variation in the metallothionein genes in wild rice Oryza rufipogon: relationship between DNA sequence polymorphism, codon bias and gene expression.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	This study examines the relationship between DNA sequence variation and level of gene expression in four metallothionein genes from wild rice Oryza rufipogon. The nucleotide diversity was 0.0028 to 0.0117 over the entire coding and non-coding region, and it was negatively correlated with gene expression for three type 2 metallothionein genes. In contrast, codon bias and percent of preferred codons correlated positively with gene expression. These results indicate that the intensity of natural selection depends on the level of gene expression, which in turn shapes the level of nucleotide polymorphism. In addition, significant linkage disequilibria were frequent between the metallothionein genes, although significance was not confirmed after multiple test correction. This result suggests that metallothionein genes expressed at different levels are epistatic with respect to fitness, and that gene expression is an important factor determining level of DNA polymorphism.
14617083	OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice.	2003	Plant J	We have isolated three genes that potentially encode a HAP3/nuclear factor-YB (NF-YB)/CCAAT binding factor-A (CBF-A) subunit of a CCAAT-box binding complex in rice (Oryza sativa), and named them OsHAP3A, OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C. These genes were expressed in various organs including leaves. In the transgenic rice plants with antisense or RNAi construct of OsHAP3A, reduced expression of not only OsHAP3A but also OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C was observed. These plants had pale green leaves, in which the amount of chlorophyll was reduced and chloroplasts were degenerated. Lamella was not well developed and accumulation of starch was not detected. The degenerated chloroplast formation was accompanied by reduced expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes such as RBCS and CAB, while expression of chloroplast-encoded genes was not affected or rather increased. These results suggest that one or more OsHAP3 genes regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded chloroplast-targeted genes and normal development of chloroplasts.
14711998	PLASTOCHRON1, a timekeeper of leaf initiation in rice, encodes cytochrome P450.	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	During postembryonic development of higher plants, the shoot apical meristem produces lateral organs in a regular spacing (phyllotaxy) and a regular timing (plastochron). Molecular analysis of mutants associated with phyllotaxy and plastochron would greatly increase understanding of the developmental mechanism of plant architecture because phyllotaxy and plastochron are fundamental regulators of plant architecture. pla1 of rice is not only a plastochron mutant showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting phyllotaxy, but also a heterochronic mutant showing ectopic shoot formation in the reproductive phase. Thus, pla1 provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of temporal regulation in leaf development. In this work, we isolated the PLA1 gene by map-based cloning. The identified PLA1 gene encodes a cytochrome P450, CYP78A11, which potentially catalyzes substances controlling plant development. PLA1 is expressed in developing leaf primordia, bracts of the panicle, and elongating internodes, but not in the shoot apical meristem. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype suggest that the PLA1 gene acting in developing leaf primordia affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of vegetative growth.
1478924	Starch branching enzymes from immature rice seeds.	1992	J Biochem	Four forms of branching enzyme, termed RBE1, RBE2 (a mixture of RBE2A and RBE2B), RBE3, and RBE4, were apparently separated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography of soluble extract from immature rice seeds, and each of these four forms was further purified by gel-filtration. RBE1, RBE2A, and RBE2B were the predominant forms of the enzyme. The molecular size, amino-terminal amino acid sequence, and immunoreactivity with anti-maize branching enzyme-I (BE-I) antibody were identical among these three forms, except that the molecular mass of RBE2A was almost 3 kDa higher than those of RBE1 and RBE2B. These results indicate that RBE1, RBE2A, and RBE2B are the same (termed rice BE-I). The cDNA clones coding for rice BE-I have been identified from a rice seed library in lambda gt11, using the maize BE-I cDNA as a probe. The nucleotide sequence indicates that rice BE-I is initially synthesized as an 820-residue precursor protein, including a putative 64- or 66-residue transit peptide at the amino terminus. The rice mature BE-I contains 756 (or 754) amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 86,734 (or 86,502) Da, and shares a high degree of sequence identity (86%) with the maize protein. The consensus sequences of the four regions that form the catalytic sites of amylolytic enzymes are conserved in the central region of the rice BE-I sequence. Thus, rice BE-I as well as the maize protein belongs to a family of amylolytic enzymes.
8360192	Alteration of the structural properties of starch components by the lack of an isoform of starch branching enzyme in rice seeds.	1993	J Biol Chem	This study describes the effect of starch-synthesizing enzymes on biosynthesis of storage starch in rice amylose-extender mutants, which contain branched D-glucans with abnormal structures. Western blot analysis indicated that two out of five amylose-extender mutant lines lacked an isoform of starch branching enzyme, termed RBE3, although the levels of granule-bound starch synthase and a major form of branching enzyme, RBE1, were normal in these two mutants. Proteins corresponding to the 87-kDa RBE3 molecule were present in the three other amylose-extender mutants as well as in the wild type. However, the level of branching enzyme activity significantly decreased in all amylose-extender mutants, suggesting that the 87-kDa proteins in these three mutants are inactive forms of RBE3. Therefore, we conclude that formation of the abnormal branched glucans in the amylose-extender mutant of rice is due to the lack of the RBE3 activity. The cDNA clones encoding RBE3 have been identified from a normal rice seed cDNA library in lambda gt11, using a synthetic oligonucleotide as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence of RBE3 indicates that this protein is initially synthesized as a precursor of 825 amino acids, including a 65-residue transit peptide at the NH2 terminus. The sequences of the catalytic regions in amylolytic enzymes are highly conserved in the sequence of RBE3. Thus, the branching enzyme isoform belongs to a family of the amylolytic enzymes. RBE3 also shares a noticeable degree of sequence identity with RBE1, especially at the central portion of the protein molecule. However, RBE3 possesses an approximately 70-residue extra sequence at the NH2 terminus and lacks a COOH-terminal sequence of almost 50 residues as compared with RBE1. The structural differences at both termini may explain the distinct role in starch synthesis for RBE1 and RBE3.
14634153	A new 9-lipoxygenase cDNA from developing rice seeds.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated a novel C9 position specific lipoxygenase (r9-LOX1) cDNA from developing rice seeds. The enzymatic features of r9-LOX1 resembled those of rice LOX-L3 known to be contained in rice germ and to have C9-specific LOX activity. However, the expression level of the r9-LOX1 gene was higher in imbibed seeds rather than developing seeds. A homology search against the rice nucleotide database revealed the r9-LOX1 gene to be on rice chromosome 3 (accession number AC093017). The restriction enzyme map of the reported genomic sequence agreed with the result of the Southern blot analysis for the r9-LOX1. The enzyme could be useful for in vitro synthesis of 9,10-ketol-octadecadienoic acid.
1326298	Characterization of a plant SINE, p-SINE1, in rice genomes.	1992	Jpn J Genet	We have previously found that a short interspersed element (SINE), named p-SINE1, is present in the Waxy gene of Oryza sativa in two copies. Here, we cloned five members of p-SINE1 located at other loci in O. sativa and determined their nucleotide sequences. These sequences had a T-rich pyrimidine tract at their defined 3' end and were flanked by direct repeats of a sequence of mostly 14-15 bp long like p-SINE1s in the Waxy gene. The consensus sequence derived from total seven members of p-SINE1 was 123 bp in length and had an internal promoter region for RNA polymerase III. The 5'-half region of the sequence was partially homologous to the tRNA-related block of rabbit C family, one of SINEs in the animal system. Two of the seven p-SINE1 members were not present in the corresponding loci in African rice, Oryza glaberrima, and may thus be available for classification of some rice strains. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the Waxy gene between O. sativa and O. glaberrima showed that base substitutions have frequently occurred in a p-SINE1 member (p-SINE1-r1) and a transposable element Tnr1 also present in the Waxy gene, suggesting that these elements, which appear as repetitive sequences in the rice chromosome, tend to acquire base substitutions at a higher frequency than do unique sequences.
10394955	Identification of a rice APETALA3 homologue by yeast two-hybrid screening.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA clone OsMADS16 was isolated from the rice young inflorescence cDNA expression library by the yeast two-hybrid screening method with OsMADS4 as bait. We have previously shown that the OsMADS4 gene is a member of the PI family and that the MADS-box gene is involved in controlling development of the second and third whorls of rice flowers. The sequence comparison indicated that OsMADS16 belongs to the AP3 family. The OsMADS16 protein contains a PI-derived motif, FAFRVVPSQPNLH, that is a conserved sequence in AP3 family genes at the C-terminal region. In addition, OsMADS16 contains a paleoAP3 motif, YGGNHDLRLG, downstream of the PI-derived motif. The paleoAP3 motif is a consensus sequence in the C-terminal region of the AP3 family genes of lower eudicot and magnolid dicot species. RNA blot analysis showed that the OsMADS16 gene was expressed in the second and third whorls, whereas the OsMADS4 transcripts were present in the second, third, and fourth whorls. These expression patterns of the OsMADS16 and OsMADS4 genes are very similar to those of AP3 and PI, respectively. In the yeast two-hybrid system, OsMADS4 interacted only with OsMADS16 among several rice MADS genes investigated, suggesting that OsMADS4 and OsMADS16 function as a heterodimer in specifying sepal and petal identities. The OsMADS16 protein displayed transcription activation ability in yeast, whereas AP3 did not. It was also shown in yeast that OsMADS16 interacted with PI whereas OsMADS4 did not interact with AP3. These differences between OsMADS16 and AP3 indicate that the functions of the AP3 family genes of monocots and dicots diverged during molecular evolution processes of the B function genes. Deletion analysis showed that the 155-200 amino acid region of the OsMADS16 protein plays an important role in the transcription activation ability.
10444103	Determination of the motif responsible for interaction between the rice APETALA1/AGAMOUS-LIKE9 family proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system.	1999	Plant Physiol	A MADS family gene, OsMADS6, was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) young flower cDNA library using OsAMDS1 as a probe. With this clone, various MADS box genes that encode for protein-to-protein interaction partners of the OsMADS6 protein were isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screening method. On the basis of sequence homology, OsMADS6 and the selected partners can be classified in the APETALA1/AGAMOUS-LIKE9 (AP1/AGL9) family. One of the interaction partners, OsMADS14, was selected for further study. Both genes began expression at early stages of flower development, and their expression was extended into the later stages. In mature flowers the OsMADS6 transcript was detectable in lodicules and also weakly in sterile lemmas and carpels, whereas the OsMADS14 transcript was detectable in sterile lemmas, paleas/lemmas, stamens, and carpels. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that the region containing of the 109th to 137th amino acid residues of OsMADS6 is indispensable in the interaction with OsMADS14. Site-directed mutation analysis revealed that the four periodical leucine residues within the region are essential for this interaction. Furthermore, it was shown that the 14 amino acid residues located immediately downstream of the K domain enhance the interaction, and that the two leucine residues within this region play an important role in that enhancement.
14572664	Osgstu3 and osgtu4, encoding tau class glutathione S-transferases, are heavy metal- and hypoxic stress-induced and differentially salt stress-responsive in rice roots.	2003	FEBS Lett	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have poorly understood roles in plant responses to environmental stresses. A polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced tau class GST was identified in rice roots by protein microsequencing. PEG and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM), Zn (30 microM), Co and Ni rapidly and markedly induced osgstu4 and osgstu3 in rice seedling roots. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were also induced in roots by hypoxic stress but not by cold nor heat shock. Salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) rapidly induced osgstu3 in rice roots, whereas osgstu4 exhibited a late salt stress and no ABA response. Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid triggered osgstu4 and osgstu3 expression. Osgstu4 and osgstu3 were rapidly and markedly induced by the antioxidant dithiothreitol and the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide, which suggested that redox perturbations and reactive oxygen species are involved in their stress response regulations.
14572653	Ospdr9, which encodes a PDR-type ABC transporter, is induced by heavy metals, hypoxic stress and redox perturbations in rice roots.	2003	FEBS Lett	Little is known about the role of pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR)-type ATP-binding (ABC) proteins in plant responses to environmental stresses. We characterised ospdr9, which encodes a rice ABC protein with a reverse (ABC-TMS(6))(2) configuration. Polyethylene glycol and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM) and Zn (30 microM) rapidly and markedly induced ospdr9 in roots of rice seedlings. Hypoxic stress also induced ospdr9 in rice roots, salt stress induced ospdr9 at low levels but cold and heat shock had no effect. The plant growth regulator jasmonic acid, the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid and the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine triggered ospdr9 expression. The antioxidants dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid rapidly and markedly induced ospdr9 in rice roots; the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide also induced ospdr9 but at three times lower levels. The results suggested that redox changes may be involved in the abiotic stress response regulation of ospdr9 in rice roots.
9218720	A group 3 LEA cDNA of rice, responsive to abscisic acid, but not to jasmonic acid, shows variety-specific differences in salt stress response.	1997	Gene	A cDNA clone oslea3, encoding a group 3 late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). The encoded OSLEA3 protein has previously been found to accumulate to higher levels in roots of two salt-tolerant compared to a salt-sensitive rice variety in response to abscisic acid (ABA) [Moons et al., 1995. Plant Physiol. 107, 177-186]. The OSLEA3 protein (Mr 20.5, pI 6.5) characteristically contains ten imperfect 11-mer amino acid repeats. Exogenous application of ABA and exposure to salt shock (150 mM NaCl) rapidly induces a de novo, abundant oslea3 transcript accumulation in seedling roots, whereas application of jasmonic acid (9 microM) does not induce oslea3 expression. The stress-induced oslea3 transcript gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock, as wilting-induced damage became irreversible. oslea3 expression was compared for the salt-tolerant variety Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Taichung N1. Higher maximal mRNA levels were found in roots of the tolerant variety, also declining less rapidly upon sustained salt shock, concomitant with a delayed drop in shoot water content. DNA blot analysis indicated the existence of a small oslea3 gene family in rice with an equal gene number in both ecotypes. The results suggest that a differential regulation of oslea3 expression is an aspect of the varietal differences in salt stress tolerance.
12060225	A long leader intron of the Ostub16 rice beta-tubulin gene is required for high-level gene expression and can autonomously promote transcription both in vivo and in vitro.	2002	Plant J	A 2 kb DNA fragment, upstream of the rice beta-tubulin isotype 16 (Ostub16) coding sequence, was isolated using inverse PCR and screening of a tubulin-enriched lambda library. An intron (863 bp) present in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) is spliced out to produce the most abundant mRNA species which corresponds to the previously cloned Ostub16 cDNA. Transient expression assays performed on rice embryogenic calluses with chimeric Ostub16::GUS constructs demonstrated that the entire 2 kb upstream sequence has a strong promoter activity, and that the 863 bp intron is required for high-level GUS expression. In addition, the intron sequence is capable per se of sustaining a weak but consistent GUS expression. Two rare Ostub16 transcripts, with a start site mapping within this intron sequence, were detected in rice coleoptile cells. The transcription start site mapped at position -290 with respect to the ATG codon, and the shorter molecule originated from splicing of the same precursor mRNA. Therefore transcriptional expression of rice beta-tubulin isotype 16 results in the synthesis of two premRNA molecules (I and II) encoding for three different mRNA species. We discuss these findings in terms of function and molecular evolution of the mechanisms that control plant beta-tubulin gene expression.

15939553	Characterization of the origin recognition complex (ORC) from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Gene	The origin recognition complex (ORC) protein plays a critical role in DNA replication through binding to sites (origins) where replication commences. The protein is composed of six subunits (ORC1 to 6) in animals and yeasts. Our knowledge of the ORC protein in plants is, however, much less complete. We have performed cDNA cloning and characterization of ORC subunits in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) in order to facilitate study of plant DNA replication mechanisms. Our previous report provided a description of a gene, ORC1 (OsORC1), that encodes one of the protein subunits. The present report extends this initial analysis to include the genes that encode four other rice ORC subunits, OsORC2, 3, 4 and 5. Northern hybridization analyses demonstrated the presence of abundant transcripts for all OsORC subunits in shoot apical meristems (SAM) and cultured cells, but not in mature leaves. Interestingly, only OsORC5 showed high levels of expression in organs in which cell proliferation is not active, such as flag leaves, the ears and the non-tip roots. The pattern of expression of OsORC2 also differed from other OsORC subunits. When cell proliferation was temporarily halted for 6-10 days by removal of sucrose from the growth medium, expression of OsORC1, OsORC3, OsORC4 and OsORC5 was substantially reduced. However, the level of expression of OsORC2 remained constant. We suggest from these results that expression of OsORC1, 3, 4 and 5 are correlated with cell proliferation, but the expression of OsORC2 is not.
15659629	Functional isolation of novel nuclear proteins showing a variety of subnuclear localizations.	2005	Plant Cell	Nuclear proteins play key roles in the fundamental regulation of genome instability, the phases of organ development, and physiological responsiveness through gene expression. Although nuclear proteins have been shown to account for approximately one-fourth of total proteins in yeast, no efficient method to identify novel nuclear proteins has been applied to plants. In this study, a trial to isolate nuclear proteins in rice was attempted, and several novel nuclear proteins showing a variety of subnuclear localizations were identified. The nuclear transportation trap (NTT) system, which is a modified two-hybrid system, isolated many nuclear proteins from rice (Oryza sativa) NTT cDNA libraries. Nuclear localization of the isolated proteins was confirmed by transient introduction of green fluorescent protein fusion constructs for a subset of protein genes into onion (Allium cepa) cells. The majority of these proteins, including novel proteins and proteins initially categorized as cytoplasmic proteins, were revealed to be localized in the nucleus. Detailed characterization of unknown proteins revealed various subnuclear localizations, indicating their possible association with chromatin and the nuclear matrix with a foci or speckle-like distribution. Some also showed dual distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the novel protein fraction, a protein was further identified for its chromatin-associated localization in a specific organ of rice by immunostaining. Thus, a variety of novel nuclear architectural proteins with chromatin or matrix associating abilities, which are important in nuclear organization by influencing certain organ developments or cell responsiveness, can be isolated using the NTT method. Because nuclear proteins other than transcription regulators have rarely been characterized in plants, such as matrix proteins and development-specific chromatin proteins, their identification and subsequent characterization could provide important information for genome-wide regulatory mechanisms controlled by nuclear organization.

15792960	RNAi-mediated silencing of OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, causes male sterility by defect of microspore development in rice.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	We have cloned a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, OsGEN-L (OsGEN-like), from rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsGEN-L possesses two domains, the N- and I-regions, that are conserved in the RAD2/XPG nuclease family. Database searches and phylogenetic analyses revealed that OsGEN-L belongs to class 4 of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, and OsGEN-L homologs were found in animals and higher plants. To elucidate the function of OsGEN-L, we generated rice OsGEN-L-RNAi transgenic plants in which OsGEN-L expression was silenced. Most of the OsGEN-L-RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male-sterile. OsGEN-L-RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development. A OsGEN-L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the OsGEN-L promoter was specifically active in the anthers. Furthermore, a recombinant OsGEN-L protein possessed flap endonuclease activity and both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA-binding activities. Our results suggest that OsGEN-L plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice.
7565598	Double-stranded RNA in rice: a novel RNA replicon in plants.	1995	Mol Gen Genet	The entire sequence of 13952 nucleotides of a plasmid-like, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from rice was assembled from more than 50 independent cDNA clones. The 5' non-coding region of the coding (sense) strand spans over 166 nucleotides, followed by one long open reading frame (ORF) of 13716 nucleotides that encodes a large putative polyprotein of 4572 amino acid residues, and by a 70-nucleotide 3' non-coding region. This ORF is apparently the longest reported to date in the plant kingdom. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the large putative polyprotein includes an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase)-like domain. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of these two domains and of the entire genetic organization of the rice dsRNA with those found in potyviruses and the CHV1-713 dsRNA of chestnut blight fungus suggest that the rice dsRNA is located evolutionarily between potyviruses and the CHV1-713 dsRNA. This plasmid-like dsRNA in rice seems to constitute a novel RNA replicon in plants.
15656983	The OsLti6 genes encoding low-molecular-weight membrane proteins are differentially expressed in rice cultivars with contrasting sensitivity to low temperature.	2005	Gene	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is sensitive to chilling particularly at early stages of seedling establishment. Two closely related genes (OsLti6a, OsLti6b), which are induced by low temperature during seedling emergence were isolated from a cold tolerant temperate japonica rice cultivar. These genes are closely related to the Arabidopsis rare cold-inducible (RCI2) and barley low-temperature-inducible (BLT101) genes. Based on direct biochemical and indirect physiological evidence and similarity with a conserved protein domain in the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) database (e.g., yeast PMP3), the rice genes belong to a class of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic proteins involved in maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane during cold, dehydration and salt stress conditions. Both genes exhibit a genotype-specific expression signature characterized by early and late stress-inducible expression in tolerant and intolerant genotypes, respectively. The differences in temporal expression profiles are consistent with cultivar differences in cold-induced membrane leakiness and seedling vigor. The presence of CRT/DRE promoter cis-elements is consistent with the synchronized expression of OsLti6 genes with the C-repeat binding factor/drought responsive element-binding protein (CBF/DREB) transcriptional activator. The present results indicate that the Oslti6 genes are part of a battery of cold stress defense-related genes regulated by a common switch.
9177027	Molecular cloning, expression and subcellular localization of a BiP homolog from rice endosperm tissue.	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	The ER luminal binding protein, BiP, has been linked to prolamine protein body formation in rice. To obtain further information on the possible role of this chaperone in protein body formation we have cloned and sequenced a BiP cDNA homolog from rice endosperm. The rice sequence is very similar to the maize BiP exhibiting 92% nucleotide identity and 96% deduced amino acid sequence identity in the coding region. Substantial amino acid sequence homology exists between rice BiP and BiP homologs from several other plant and animal species including long stretches of conservation through the amino-terminal ATPase domain. Considerable variation, however, is observed within the putative carboxy-terminal peptide-binding domain between the plant and nonplant BiP sequences. A single hand of approximately 2.4 kb was visible when RNA gel blots of total RNA purified from seed tissue were probed with radiolabeled rice BiP cDNA. This band increased in intensity during seed development up to 10 days after flowering, and then decreased gradually until seed maturity. Protein gel blots indicated that BiP polypeptide accumulation parallels that of the prolamine polypeptides throughout seed development. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that BiP is localized in a non-stochastic fashion in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex of developing endosperm cells. It is abundant on the periphery of the protein inclusion body but not in the central portion of the protein body or in the cisternal ER membranes connecting the protein bodies. These data support a model which proposes that BiP associates with the newly synthesized prolamine polypeptide to facilitate its folding and assembly into a protein inclusion body, and is then recycled.
15079051	Overexpression of a zinc-finger protein gene from rice confers tolerance to cold, dehydration, and salt stress in transgenic tobacco.	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Stress perception and signal transduction leading to tolerance involve a complex interplay of different gene products. We describe here the isolation and characterization of an intronless gene (OSISAP1) from rice encoding a zinc-finger protein that is induced after different types of stresses, namely cold, desiccation, salt, submergence, and heavy metals as well as injury. The gene is also induced by stress hormone abscisic acid. Overexpression of the gene in transgenic tobacco conferred tolerance to cold, dehydration, and salt stress at the seed-germination/seedling stage as reflected by the percentage of germination/green seedlings, the fresh weight of seedlings, and their developmental pattern. Thus, OSISAP1 seems to be an important determinant of stress response in plants.
2973410	Abscisic acid and water-stress induce the expression of a novel rice gene.	1988	EMBO J	We have identified a novel rice gene, called RAB 21, which is induced when plants are subject to water-stress. This gene encodes a basic, glycine-rich protein (mol. wt 16,529) which has a duplicated domain structure. Immunoblots probed with antibodies raised against beta-galactosidase/RAB 21 fusion protein detect RAB 21 protein only in cytosolic cell fractions. RAB 21 mRNA and protein accumulate in rice embryos, leaves, roots and callus-derived suspension cells upon treatment with NaCl (200 mM) and/or the plant hormone abscisic acid (10 microM ABA). The effects of NaCl and ABA are not cumulative, suggesting that these two inducers share a common response pathway. Induction of RAB 21 mRNA accumulation by ABA is rapid (less than 15 min in suspension cells) and does not require protein synthesis, indicating that preformed nuclear and/or cytosolic factors mediate the response to this hormone. We have characterized the RAB 21 gene by determining the complete nucleotide sequence of a nearly full-length cDNA and corresponding genomic copy, and by mapping the start site of its major transcript. The proximal promoter region contains various GC-rich repeats.
14634161	The evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	In Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37)-->OsPRR95 (OsPRR59)-->OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice.
15725670	Circadian-associated rice pseudo response regulators (OsPRRs): insight into the control of flowering time.	2005	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	A small family of plant proteins, designated PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATORS (PRRs), is crucial for a better understanding of the molecular link between circadian rhythm and photoperiodic control of flowering time in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, we showed that the monocotyledonous model plant Oryza sativa also has homologous members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa PRR). In the previous experiments with rice, we mainly characterized a japonica variety (Nipponbare). By employing an indica variety (Kasalath), in this study we further characterized OsPRRs with reference to the photoperiod sensitivity Hd (Heading date) QTL (quantitative trait loci) implicated in the control of flowering time in rice. The circadian-controlled and sequential expression profiles of the five OsPRR genes were observed not only for Nipponbare but also for Kasalath. Then each of these OsPRR genes was mapped on the rice chromosomes. Among these OsPRR genes, OsPRR37 was mapped very closely to Hd2-QTL, which was identified as the major locus that enhances the photoperiod sensitivity of flowering in Nipponbare. Furthermore, we found that Kasalath has a severe mutational lesion in the OsPRR37 coding sequence.
14716315	Sequencing of a rice centromere uncovers active genes.	2004	Nat Genet	Centromeres are the last frontiers of complex eukaryotic genomes, consisting of highly repetitive sequences that resist mapping, cloning and sequencing. The centromere of rice Chromosome 8 (Cen8) has an unusually low abundance of highly repetitive satellite DNA, which allowed us to determine its sequence. A region of approximately 750 kb in Cen8 binds rice CENH3, the centromere-specific H3 histone. CENH3 binding is contained within a larger region that has abundant dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3-Lys9), consistent with Cen8 being embedded in heterochromatin. Fourteen predicted and at least four active genes are interspersed in Cen8, along with CENH3 binding sites. The retrotransposons located in and outside of the CENH3 binding domain have similar ages and structural dynamics. These results suggest that Cen8 may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of centromeres from genic regions, as in human neocentromeres, to fully mature centromeres that accumulate megabases of homogeneous satellite arrays.
9501993	Rice class III chitinase homologues isolated by random cloning of rice cDNAs.	1997	DNA Res	We obtained seven kinds of cDNA clones putatively identified as encoding class III chitinases from cDNA libraries constructed from dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)- and benzyl adenine (BA)- treated rice callus. Putative amino acid sequences encoded in these cDNA clones were compared with those of known chitinases of other plants. Two clones coded for homologues that show high similarity to class III chitinases. These clones contained the common glutamic acid at the active site and were classified as true homologues. The other five clones, however, showed relatively low similarity to class III chitinases and their active sites contained aspartic acid instead of glutamic acid. These clones may correspond to relatives of a super family of class III chitinases. The location of the genes coding for these homologues on the rice genome has been determined by genetic linkage analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphism.
12506001	SUPERWOMAN1 and DROOPING LEAF genes control floral organ identity in rice.	2003	Development	We analyzed recessive mutants of two homeotic genes in rice, SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1) and DROOPING LEAF (DL). The homeotic mutation spw1 transforms stamens and lodicules into carpels and palea-like organs, respectively. Two spw1 alleles, spw1-1 and spw1-2, show the same floral phenotype and did not affect vegetative development. We show that SPW1 is a rice APETALA3 homolog, OsMADS16. In contrast, two strong alleles of the dl locus, drooping leaf-superman1 (dl-sup1) and drooping leaf-superman2 (dl-sup2), cause the complete transformation of the gynoecium into stamens. In these strong mutants, many ectopic stamens are formed in the region where the gynoecium is produced in the wild-type flower and they are arranged in a non-whorled, alternate pattern. The intermediate allele dl-1 (T65), results in an increase in the number of stamens and stigmas, and carpels occasionally show staminoid characteristics. In the weakest mutant, dl-2, most of the flowers are normal. All four dl alleles cause midrib-less drooping leaves. The flower of the double mutant, spw1 dl-sup, produces incompletely differentiated organs indefinitely after palea-like organs are produced in the position where lodicules are formed in the wild-type flower. These incompletely differentiated organs are neither stamens nor carpels, but have partial floral identity. Based on genetic and molecular results, we postulate a model of stamen and carpel specification in rice, with DL as a novel gene controlling carpel identity and acting mutually and antagonistically to the class B gene, SPW1.
14701929	Molecular and biochemical analyses of OsRab7, a rice Rab7 homolog.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Rab7 is a small GTP-binding protein important in early to late endosome/lysosome vesicular transport in mammalian cells. We have isolated a Rab7 cDNA clone, OsRab7, from a cold-treated rice cDNA library by the subtraction screening method. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 206 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of about 23 kDa. Its predicted amino acid sequence shows significantly high identity with the sequences of other Rab7 proteins. His-tagged OsRab7 bound to radiolabeled GTPgammaS in a specific and stoichiometric manner. Biochemical and structural properties of the Rab7 wild type (WT) protein were compared to those of Q67L and T22N mutants. The detergent 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) increased the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis activities of Rab7WT. The OsRab7Q67L mutant showed much lower GTPase activity compared to the WT protein untreated with CHAPS, and the T22N mutant showed no GTP binding activity at all. The OsRab7Q67L mutant was constitutively active for guanine nucleotide binding while the T22N mutant (dominant negative) showed no guanine nucleotide binding activity. When bound to GTP, the Rab7WT and the Q67L mutants were protected from tryptic proteolysis. The cleavage pattern of the Rab7T22N mutant, however, was not affected by GTP addition. Northern and Western blot analyses suggested that OsRab7 is distributed in various tissues of rice. Furthermore, expression of a rice Rab7 gene was differentially regulated by various environmental stimuli such as cold, NaCl, dehydration, and ABA. In addition, subcellular localization of OsRab7 was investigated in the Arabidopsis protoplasts by a double-labeling experiment using GFP-fused OsRab7 and FM4-64. GFP-OsRab7 is localized to the vacuolar membrane, suggesting that OsRab7 is implicated in a vesicular transport to the vacuole in plant cells.
8820608	A rice bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, is rapidly induced by abscisic acid.	1996	Plant J	A cDNA that encoded a bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, was isolated from a rice embryo cDNA library by use of degenerate oligonucleotide probes that corresponded to the amino acid sequences conserved among the basic regions of plant G-box-binding factor-type bZIP proteins (GBF). OSBZ8 was shown to have structural features typical of the GBF-type bZIP proteins and to bind to G-box and G-box-like sequences that include ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) which have been functionally identified in the promoters of ABA-inducible genes, such as Em, Osem and Rab16. The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA was induced by treatment with ABA of imbibed mature rice embryos, of young plant tissues and of suspension-cultured cells. The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA in response to ABA preceded that of Osem and Rab16A mRNAs and was not inhibited by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. By contrast, the induction of Osem and Rab16A was partially inhibited and almost completely inhibited, respectively, by cycloheximide. These results strongly suggest that OSBZ8 might be involved in the regulation of transcription by ABA in rice.
8616263	Genomic structure of the rice aldolase isozyme C-1 gene and its regulation through a Ca 2+ -mediated protein kinase-phosphatase pathway.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Complementary and genomic DNA clones coding for aldolase C-1, the fourth-type isozyme of aldolase in rice Oryza sativa L., have been characterized. The organization of the gene is quite similar to those encoding rice aldolase C-a and a maize cytoplasmic-type aldolase, in that introns are located in the same position. Amino acid sequences are highly conserved among cytoplasmic aldolases in plants. Expression of the gene in rice callus is activated by a protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and is inhibited in the presence of thapsigargin, a reagent which increases calcium influx into the cytoplasm. The inhibition is rescued by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase inhibitor H-7. Thus, it is suggested that expression of the aldolase C-1 gene is regulated through a signal transduction pathway involving a Ca 2+ -mediated protein kinase-protein phosphatase system.

9193078	Expression of a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice, a glycinebetaine nonaccumulator, and possible localization of its protein in peroxisomes.	1997	Plant J	Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) catalyzes the last step in the plant biosynthetic pathway that leads to glycinebetaine. Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.), albeit considered a typical non-glycinebetaine accumulating species, have been found to express this enzyme at low levels. This observation evokes an interest in phylogenic evolution of the enzyme in the plant kingdom. It is reported here that rice plants possess the ability to take up exogenously added betaine aldehyde through the roots and convert it to glycinebetaine, resulting in an enhanced salt-tolerance of the plants. A gene encoding a putative BADH from the rice genome was also cloned and sequenced. The gene was found to contain 14 introns, and the overall nucleotide sequence of the coding region is c. 78% identical to that of the barley BADH cDNA. Cloning of a partial BADH cDNA from rice was accomplished by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was found to be identical to the corresponding exon regions of the rice genomic BADH gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of rice and barley BADH both contain a C-terminal tripeptide SKL, a signal known to target preproteins to microbodies. This localization was confirmed by an immuno-gold labeling study of transgenic tobacco harboring barley cDNA, which showed BADH protein inside peroxisomes. Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of BADH mRNA is salt-inducible.
10095115	Four rice genes encoding cysteine synthase: isolation and differential responses to sulfur, nitrogen and light.	1999	Gene	Four cDNA clones, rcs1, rcs2, rcs3 and rcs4, encoding cysteine synthase [O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase] were isolated from rice. The predicted amino acid sequences contain the conserved PXXSVKDR region characteristic of cysteine synthase, which includes the lysine residue that binds the cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Molecular phylogenic analysis suggests that, whereas rcs1 and rcs3 belong to the cytosolic isoform family, rcs2 and rcs4 form a new family of cysteine synthase. Transcript accumulation of each gene was examined for organ specificity, and also for response to sulfur, nitrogen and light. The rcs1 transcript accumulated in all organs examined, and was induced in shoots and roots upon sulfur starvation under non-limiting nitrogen conditions. The rcs2 transcript accumulated in shoots grown in the light, but disappeared almost completely by dark treatment. The rcs3 transcript was found more abundantly in roots than in shoots, and was reduced in the dark, as well as under sulfur and nitrogen deprivation. The rcs4 transcript was scarce in all organs examined. These observations indicate that cysteine synthase genes encode functionally distinct cysteine synthase isoforms, and that they are coordinately regulated by the availability of sulfur, nitrogen, and light.
12147736	Molecular cloning and characterization of plant genes encoding novel peroxisomal molybdoenzymes of the sulphite oxidase family.	2002	J Exp Bot	The Arabidopsis AtMCP and rice OsMCP genes which encode proteins highly homologous to molybdoenzymes of the sulphite oxidase family were isolated and characterized. Both proteins seemed to possess only a molybdenum cofactor as the redox centre, unlike all the other eukaryotic molybdoenzymes. Putative MCP orthologues were identified in 17 plant species, indicating that MCPs are widely distributed over the plant kingdom [corrected]. An analysis using a green fluorescent protein fusion showed that AtMCP possesses a peroxisomal targeting signal at its C-terminus. Putative peroxisomal targeting signals were also found in all plant MCPs, suggesting the existence of a new redox pathway in this organelle.

8680309	Starch debranching enzyme (R-enzyme or pullulanase) from developing rice endosperm: purification, cDNA and chromosomal localization of the gene.	1996	Planta	Starch debranching enzyme (R-enzyme or pullulanase) was purified to homogeneity from developing endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Fujihikari) using a variety of high-performance liquid chromatography columns, and characterized. A cDNA clone encoding the full length of the rice endosperm debranching enzyme was isolated and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2958 bp. The mature debranching enzyme of rice appears to be composed of 912 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass (Mr) of 102,069 Da, similar in size to its Mr of about 100,000 Da estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid sequence of rice debranching enzyme is substantially similar to that of bacterial pullulanase, while it bears little similarity to that of bacterial isoamylase or to glycogen debranching enzymes from human muscle and rabbit muscle. Southern blot analyses strongly suggest that the debranching enzyme gene is present as a single copy in the rice genome. Analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphism with a probe including the 3'-untranslated region of cDNA for rice debranching enzyme confirmed that the debranching enzyme gene is located on chromosome 4.
16027975	Essential amino acids of starch synthase IIa differentiate amylopectin structure and starch quality between japonica and indica rice varieties.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	Four amino acids were variable between the 'active' indica-type and 'inactive' japonica-type soluble starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) of rice plants; Glu-88 and Gly-604 in SSIIa of indica-cultivars IR36 and Kasalath were replaced by Asp-88 and Ser-604, respectively, in both japonica cultivars Nipponbare and Kinmaze SSIIa, whereas Val-737 and Leu-781 in indica SSIIa were replaced by Met-737 in cv. Nipponbare and Phe-781 in cv. Kinmaze SSIIa, respectively. The SSIIa gene fragments shuffling experiments revealed that Val-737 and Leu-781 are essential not only for the optimal SSIIa activity, but also for the capacity to synthesize indica-type amylopectin. Surprisingly, however, a combination of Phe-781 and Gly-604 could restore about 44% of the SSIIa activity provided that Val-737 was conserved. The introduction of the 'active' indica-type SSIIa gene enabled the japonica-type cv. Kinmaze to synthesize indica-type amylopectin. The starch in the transformed japonica rice plants exhibited gelatinization-resistant properties that are characteristic of indica-rice starch. Transformed lines expressing different levels of the IR36 SSIIa protein produced a variety of starches with amylopectin chain-length distribution patterns that correlated well with their onset temperatures of gelatinization. The present study confirmed that the SSIIa activity determines the type of amylopectin structure of rice starch to be either the typical indica-type or japonica-type, by playing a specific role in the synthesis of the long B(1) chains by elongating short A and B(1) chains, notwithstanding the presence of functional two additional SSII genes, a single SSI gene, two SSIII genes, and two SSIV genes in rice plants.
8666249	Cloning of the rice seed alpha-globulin-encoding gene: sequence similarity of the 5'-flanking region to those of the genes encoding wheat high-molecular-weight glutenin and barley D hordein.	1996	Gene	A genomic clone encoding the rice endosperm major globulin (alpha-globulin) with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa was isolated, and its nucleotide (nt) sequence and transcription start point (tsp) were determined. The tsp was identical to that of the gene encoding the wheat high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunit. The consensus '-300 element' and an A + T-rich sequence exist upstream from the TATA box in the 5'-flanking region. A nt sequence of about 130 bp in the 5'-flanking region was found to be markedly homologous to those of the genes encoding the wheat HMW glutenin subunit and barley D hordein.
8980514	The same nuclear proteins bind to the 5'-flanking regions of genes for the rice seed storage protein: 16 kDa albumin, 13 kDa prolamin and type II glutelin.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Expression of rice seed storage-protein genes is dramatically regulated over a short period of seed maturation. To characterize the expression mechanism of the rice seed storage protein genes, their expression of major storage protein genes (16 kDa albumin, 13 kDa prolamin and type II glutelin) were compared by RNA blot analysis. Their coordinate expression suggests that the transcriptional regulatory machinery is shared among the glutelin, prolamin and albumin-genes. We isolated two novel genomic genes for prolamins (PG5a and PG5b) and obtained the promoter region of the glutelin gene by PCR. The 5'-flanking regions of these three rice seed storage protein genes were found to contain some similar conserved sequences. Nuclear extract partially purified from maturing rice seeds was used for the gel shift assay of the 5' region of the RA gene. We identified two DNA sequences of RA gene which were recognized by independent DNA-binding proteins. The complexes of these DNA sequences and DNA-binding proteins were inhibited by the fragments containing the 5' regions of the prolamin and glutelin genes, suggesting that these three genes share transcription factors.
9049271	Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Many plant basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) proteins have been isolated several of which have been shown to play a role in seed-specific gene expression. We isolated a novel bZIP protein (REB) gene encoding 425 amino acid residues from rice endosperm, which is similar to Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) of maize. The gene product, termed REB, contains Pro- and Gly-rich regions at its N terminus, followed by the typical basic and leucine-repeat regions. Recombinant REB binds to the region from -754 to -562 in the alpha-globulin gene promoter, but not to promoters of other major storage genes such as glutelin, prolamin and albumin. The 5' region of the alpha-globulin gene possesses three binding sites for REB, which were determined as GCCACGT(A/C)AG, by using synthetic oligonucleotides. A Super-shift assay using anti-REB antibody suggested that REB is a major DNA-binding protein for the alpha-globulin gene promoter in rice endosperm.
12520304	Mobilization of a transposon in the rice genome.	2003	Nature	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important crop worldwide and, with the availability of the draft sequence, a useful model for analysing the genome structure of grasses. To practice efficient rice breeding through genetic engineering techniques, it is important to identify the economically important genes in this crop. The use of mobile transposons as gene tags in intact plants is a powerful tool for functional analysis because transposon insertions often inactivate genes. Here we identify an active rice transposon named miniature Ping (mPing) through analysis of the mutability of a slender mutation of the glume-the seed structure that encloses and determines the shape of the grain. The mPing transposon is inserted in the slender glume (slg) mutant allele but not in the wild-type allele. Search of the O. sativa variety Nipponbare genome identified 34 sequences with high nucleotide similarity to mPing, indicating that mPing constitutes a family of transposon elements. Excision of mPing from slg plants results in reversion to a wild-type phenotype. The mobility of the transposon mPing in intact rice plants represents a useful alternative tool for the functional analysis of rice genes.
10664124	Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria.	2000	Planta	Two cDNA clones encoding F(1)F(0)-ATPase inhibitor proteins, which are loosely associated with the F(1) part of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase, were characterized from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). A Northern hybridization showed that the two genes (designated as IF(1)-1 and IF(1)-2) are transcribed in all the organs examined. However, the steady-state mRNA levels varied among organs. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two IF(1) genes and the amino acid sequence of the mature IF(1) protein from potato revealed that IF(1)-1 and IF(1)-2 have N-terminal extensions with features that are characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting signal. To determine the subcellular localization of the gene products, the IF(1)-1 or IF(1)-2 proteins were fused in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the fused GFP-beta-glucuronidase, and expressed transiently in onion or dayflower epidermal cells. Localized fluorescence was detected in mitochondria, confirming that the two IF(1) proteins are targeted to mitochondria.
11027709	Expression of a gene encoding mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice increases under submerged conditions.	2000	Plant Physiol	It is known that alcoholic fermentation is important for survival of plants under anaerobic conditions. Acetaldehyde, one of the intermediates of alcoholic fermentation, is not only reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase but also can be oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). To determine whether ALDH plays a role in anaerobic metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare), we characterized a cDNA clone encoding mitochondrial ALDH from rice (Aldh2a). Analysis of sub-cellular localization of ALDH2a protein using green fluorescent protein and an in vitro ALDH assay using protein extracts from Escherichia coli cells that overexpressed ALDH2a indicated that ALDH2a functions in the oxidation of acetaldehyde in mitochondria. A Southern-blot analysis indicated that mitochondrial ALDH is encoded by at least two genes in rice. We found that the Aldh2a mRNA was present at high levels in leaves of dark-grown seedlings, mature leaf sheaths, and panicles. It is interesting that expression of the rice Aldh2a gene, unlike the expression of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Aldh2a gene, was induced in rice seedlings by submergence. Experiments with ruthenium red, which is a blocker of Ca(2+) fluxes in rice as well as maize (Zea mays), suggest that the induction of expression of Adh1 and Pdc1 by low oxygen stress is regulated by elevation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) level. However, the induction of Aldh2a gene expression may not be controlled by the cytosolic Ca(2+) level elevation. A possible involvement of ALDH2a in the submergence tolerance of rice is discussed.
3267237	Putative termination sites for rDNA transcription in rice.	1988	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A clone bearing a 9.8 kb insert DNA containing the rDNA unit was identified by screening an EcoR1 library of rice DNA in lambda Charon 4 phage with [32P]-rRNAs. The S1 nuclease mapping of the rDNA-precursor rRNA hybrids showed the presence of two transcription termini on the rDNA. They were mapped at positions 616 and 620 nucleotides downstream to the end of the 25S rRNA gene. The 18 nucleotide sequence, where the transcription terminates on the rDNA in rice and mice are homologous albeit in the reverse orientation.
2543387	Initiation of transcription of rDNA in rice.	1989	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Three direct repeats of 320, 340 and 238 nucleotides were detected upstream to the 5' end of the 18S rRNA gene of an rDNA unit present on a 9.8 kb EcoRI fragment of the rice DNA. The primer extension analysis showed that the site of initiation of transcription is in the 1st repeat at an A, the 623rd nucleotide upstream to the 5' end of the 18S rRNA gene. Different stretches of the intergenic spacer DNA linked to the Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene were transcribed in the intact nuclei of rice embryos. The S1 nuclease protection analysis of the transcripts using [32P]-labelled Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene as the probe showed the presence of multiple promoters for rDNA transcription.
8940135	Characterization of three rice basic/leucine zipper factors, including two inhibitors of EmBP-1 DNA binding activity.	1996	J Biol Chem	The promoter of the wheat Em gene contains elements with a CACGTG core sequence (G-boxes), which are recognized by EmBP-1, a wheat basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein. G-boxes are required for Em expression in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid and for transactivation by the Viviparous-1 protein (VP1) using transient expression systems. In order to identify other factors that are part of the transcriptional complex that associates with G-boxes, we have screened a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA library with biotinylated EmBP-1. We have isolated osZIP-1a, a homolog of EmBP-1 and other plant G-box-binding factors. We show that EmBP-1 and osZIP-1a will preferentially heterodimerize in vitro. Overexpression of osZIP-1a in rice protoplasts can enhance expression from the Em promoter only in the presence of abscisic acid. Two other clones have been identified by screening with EmBP-1: osZIP-2a and osZIP-2b. These osZIP-2 factors represent a novel class of bZIP proteins with an unusual DNA-binding domain that does not recognize G-boxes. The osZIP-2 factors can heterodimerize with EmBP-1 and prevent it from binding to the Em promoter. Interestingly, osZIP-1a does not heterodimerize with the osZIP-2 factors and its DNA binding activity is unaffected by their presence. Thus, osZIP-2 factors may be involved in sequestering a particular group of G-box-binding factors into inactive heterodimers.
8049366	Isolation of a monocot 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene that is elicitor-inducible.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	The rice (Oryza sativa) phytoalexins, momilactones and oryzalexins, are synthesized by the isoprenoid pathway. An early step in this pathway, one that is rate-limiting in mammalian systems, is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). A gene that encodes this enzyme has been isolated from rice, and found to contain an open reading frame of 1527 bases. The encoded protein sequence of the rice HMGR appears to be conserved with respect to other HMGR proteins, and 1 or 2 membrane-spanning domains characteristic of plant HMGRs are predicted by a hydropathy plot of the amino acid sequence. The protein is truncated at its 5' end, and shows reduced sequence conservation in this region as compared to other plant sequences. The rice genome contains a small family of HMGR genes. The isolated gene, HMGR I, is expressed at low levels in both vegetative and floral organs of rice plants. It is not induced in plants by wounding, but is strongly and rapidly induced in suspension cells by a fungal cell wall elicitor from the pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of rice blast disease. This suggests that HMGR I may be important in the induction of rice phytoalexin biosynthesis in response to pathogen attack, and therefore may play a key role as a component of the inducible defense mechanism in rice.
15280039	Stemar-13-ene synthase, a diterpene cyclase involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S in rice.	2004	FEBS Lett	In suspension-cultured rice cells, diterpenoid phytoalexins are produced in response to exogenously applied elicitors. We isolated a cDNA encoding a diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin elicitor. The OsDTC2 cDNA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, and the recombinant OsDTC2 was indicated to function as stemar-13-ene synthase that converted syn-copalyl diphosphate to stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The level of OsDTC2 mRNA in suspension-cultured rice cells began to increase 3 h after addition of the elicitor and reached the maximum after 8 h. The expression of OsDTC2 was also induced in UV-irradiated rice leaves. In addition, we indicated that stemar-13-ene accumulated in the chitin-elicited suspension-cultured rice cells and the UV-irradiated rice leaves.
8148649	PF1: an A-T hook-containing DNA binding protein from rice that interacts with a functionally defined d(AT)-rich element in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter.	1994	Plant Cell	Phytochrome-imposed down-regulation of the expression of its own phytochrome A gene (PHYA) is one of the fastest light-induced effects on transcription reported in plants to date. Functional analysis of the oat PHYA3 promoter in a transfection assay has revealed two positive elements, PE1 and PE3, that function synergistically to support high levels of transcription in the absence of light. We have isolated a rice cDNA clone (pR4) encoding a DNA binding protein that binds to the AT-rich PE1 element. We tested the selectivity of the pR4-encoded DNA binding activity using linker substitution mutations of PE1 that are known to disrupt positive expression supported by the PHYA3 promoter in vivo. Binding to these linker substitution mutants was one to two orders of magnitude less than to the native PE1 element. Because this is the behavior expected of positive factor 1 (PF1), the presumptive nuclear transcription factor that acts in trans at the PE1 element in vivo, the data support the conclusion that the protein encoded by pR4 is in fact rice PF1. The PF1 polypeptide encoded by pR4 is 213 amino acids long and contains four repeats of the A-T hook DNA binding motif found in high-mobility group I-Y (HMGI-Y) proteins. In addition, PF1 contains an 11-amino acid-long hydrophobic region characteristic of HMG I proteins, its N-terminal region shows strong similarities to a pea H1 histone sequence and a short peptide sequence from wheat HMGa, and it shows a high degree of similarity along its entire length to the HMG Y-like protein encoded by a soybean cDNA, SB16. In vitro footprinting and quantitative gel shift analyses showed that PF1 binds preferentially to the PE1 element but also at lower affinity to two other AT-rich regions upstream of PE1. This feature is consistent with the binding characteristics of HMG I-Y proteins that are known to bind to most runs of six or more AT base pairs. Taken together, the properties of PF1 suggest that it belongs to a newly described family of nuclear proteins containing both histone H1 domains and A-T hook DNA binding domains.
8062823	Identification of a high affinity NH4+ transporter from plants.	1994	EMBO J	Despite the important role of the ammonium ion in metabolism, i.e. as a form of nitrogen that is taken up from the soil by microorganisms and plants, little is known at the molecular level about its transport across biomembranes. Biphasic uptake kinetics have been observed in roots of several plant species. To study such transport processes, a mutant yeast strain that is deficient in two NH4+ uptake systems was used to identify a plant NH4+ transporter. Expression of an Arabidopsis cDNA in the yeast mutant complemented the uptake deficiency. The cDNA AMT1 contains an open reading frame of 501 amino acids and encodes a highly hydrophobic protein with 9-12 putative membrane spanning regions. Direct uptake measurements show that mutant yeast cells expressing the protein are able to take up [14C]methylamine. Methylamine uptake can be efficiently competed by NH4+ but not by K+. The methylamine uptake is optimal at pH 7 with a Km of 65 microM and a Ki for NH4+ of approximately 10 microM, is energy-dependent and can be inhibited by protonophores. The plant protein is highly related to an NH4+ transporter from yeast (Marini et al., accompanying manuscript). Sequence homologies to genes of bacterial and animal origin indicate that this type of transporter is conserved over a broad range of organisms. Taken together, the data provide strong evidence that a gene for the plant high affinity NH4+ uptake has been identified.
8388748	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA which encodes a ubiquitin protein and a 52 amino acid extension protein.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA clone encoding the ubiquitin protein fused to a ribosomal protein. This clone encodes a single ubiquitin polypeptide and extension protein of 53 amino acids. This extension protein shows a high degree of homology with those of the yeast ubil or ubi2 gene, both of which encode the same protein. Northern blot analysis suggested that the expression pattern of this gene is more similar to other ribosomal protein genes not linked to ubiquitin protein than to the polyubiquitin gene.
8218399	The primary structure of two proteins from the small ribosomal subunit of rice.	1993	Biochim Biophys Acta	We isolated two rice cDNAs which encode an open reading frame of 117 amino acids or 82 amino acids. Their deduced amino acid sequence correspond to the ribosomal proteins (r-protein). A comparison of the amino acid sequence shows that the deduced amino acid sequence of one cDNA is homologous to the rat r-protein S20 and Xenopus r-protein S22. Another encoded products with a high degree of homology to the rat r-protein S21 and the yeast r-protein YS25.
8373808	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA which encodes the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A.	1993	Biochim Biophys Acta	We isolated a rice cDNA which encodes an open reading frame of 413 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) protein. A comparison to the equivalent sequence from tobacco and mouse shows 93.7% and 68.0% homology, respectively.
8218398	The primary structure of two proteins from the large ribosomal subunit of rice.	1993	Biochim Biophys Acta	We isolated two rice cDNAs which encode an open reading frame of 389 amino acids. Their deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to the ribosomal protein (r-protein). A comparison of amino acid sequence shows that the deduced amino acid sequence of one cDNA is homologous to Arabidopsis, yeast and the rat r-protein L3. Another encoded products with a high degree of homology to the rat r-protein L7A and yeast r-protein L4.
12000455	OsPNH1 regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice.	2002	Plant J	The Arabidopsis PINHEAD/ZWILLE (PNH/ZLL) gene is thought to play an important role in the formation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in leaf adaxial cell specification. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of rice development, we have isolated a rice homologue of PNH/ZLL, called OsPNH1. Around the SAM, OsPNH1 was strongly expressed in developing leaf primordia, specifically in the presumptive vascular domains, developing vascular tissues, a few cell-layers of the adaxial region, and future bundle sheath extension cells. In the SAM, only weak expression was observed in the central region, whereas strong expression was detected in the mid-vein region of leaf founder cells in the peripheral SAM domain. We produced transgenic rice plants containing the antisense OsPNH1 strand. The antisense OsPNH1 plants developed malformed leaves with an altered vascular arrangement and abnormal internal structure. These plants also formed an aberrant SAM with reduced KNOX gene expression. We examined the subcellular localization of the OsPNH1-GFP fusion protein and found that it was localized in the cytoplasm. On the basis of these observations, we propose that OsPNH1 functions not only in SAM maintenance as previously thought, but also in leaf formation through vascular development.
7901749	Sequence variation, differential expression and chromosomal location of rice chitinase genes.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	Rice chitinases are encoded by a small multigene family. To clarify the overall organization of rice chitinase genes, we have isolated and characterized the genes Cht-1, Cht-2 and Cht-3. Although all the three genes encode class I chitinase, the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions of Cht-1 and Cht-3 are very similar (90%), while that of Cht-2 is clearly more divergent (78%). Only Cht-2 has a 130 bp intron and encodes a C-terminal peptide sequence similar to that known to function as a vacuolar targeting signal. In 5' flanking regions of Cht-1 and Cht-3, but not of Cht-2, conserved sequences (GGCCGGCYGCCCYAG) were found. Related sequences were found also in the 5' flanking regions of another chitinase gene and a beta-glucanase gene which has also been reported to be stress-induced in rice. RNA blot hybridization analysis demonstrated that the stress-induced expression patterns of the Cht-1 and Cht-3 genes are similar, but quite different from that of Cht-2. However, all three genes are active in unstressed roots. By restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis, Cht-1 and Cht-3 were mapped onto chromosome 6 and shown to be closely linked (0.8 cM). Cht-2 was mapped onto chromosome 5. All these features suggest that the expression patterns of rice class I chitinase genes may be correlated with their levels of sequence divergence and their chromosomal location.
9339541	RIRE1, a retrotransposon from wild rice Oryza australiensis.	1997	Genes Genet Syst	RIRE1 is a retrotransposon present in wild rice Oryza australiensis in an extraordinary number of copies, and only a portion of the LTR sequence has been determined previously. Here, we isolated and sequenced DNA segments of various portions of RIRE1, revealing that the sequences of LTR and the internal region were 1523 and 5277 bp in length, respectively. The internal region shows homology with the pol region in copia, a Drosophila retrotransposon, indicating that RIRE1 is a copia-like retrotransposon. The internal region of RIRE1 contained an open reading frame coding for genes, gag, pro, int, rt and rh, like copia and retroelements related to it. A clone screened from a library of the O. australiensis genomic DNA contained solo LTR, which was flanked by direct repeats of a 5-bp sequence. This suggests that RIRE1 generates a duplication of the target sequence of 5 bp upon retroposition. We observed that many RIRE1 members were nested by another RIRE1 member. This indicates that these RIRE1 members have received another RIRE1 to make an extraordinary number of copies in the O. australiensis genome without giving a deleterious effect on the growth of rice cells.
15031413	The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis.	2004	Plant Cell	We have identified and characterized a novel gene, PAIR1 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1), required for homologous chromosome pairing and cytokinesis in male and female meiocytes of rice (Oryza sativa). The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis-specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes. The PAIR1 gene encodes a 492-amino acid protein, which contains putative coiled-coil motifs in the middle, two basic regions at both termini, and a potential nuclear localization signal at the C terminus. Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis. During prophase I of the pair1 meiocyte, all the chromosomes became entangled to form a compact sphere adhered to a nucleolus, and homologous pairing failed. At anaphase I and telophase I, chromosome nondisjunction and degenerated spindle formation resulted in multiple uneven spore production. However, chromosomal fragmentation frequent in plant meiotic mutants was never observed in all of the pair1 meiocytes. These observations clarify that the PAIR1 protein plays an essential role in establishment of homologous chromosome pairing in rice meiosis.
16410547	PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome synapsis in rice meiosis I.	2006	J Cell Sci	The PAIR2 gene is required for homologous chromosome synapsis at meiosis I in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and encodes a HORMA-domain protein that is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOP1 and Arabidopsis ASY1. Immunocytological and electron microscopic analyses indicate that PAIR2 proteins associate with axial elements (AEs) at leptotene and zygotene, and is removed from the AEs of arm regions when homologous chromosomes have been synapsed. Immunocytology against a centromeric histone H3 variant revealed that PAIR2 remains at centromeres until diakinesis, by which time the homologous centromeres had already been synapsed. However, neither precocious segregation of sister chromatids nor kinetochore dysfunction is observed, and AEs are normally assembled in the mutant. In the pair2-null mutant, homologous chromosome synapsis is completely eliminated. This study provides the first description of AE-associated protein in monocot plants and indicates that PAIR2 plays an essential role in promoting homologous chromosome synapsis. However, PAIR2 does not play a role in AE formation, sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres or kinetochore assembly in meiosis I of rice.
12897248	The MSP1 gene is necessary to restrict the number of cells entering into male and female sporogenesis and to initiate anther wall formation in rice.	2003	Plant Cell	The function of the novel gene MSP1 (MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE), which controls early sporogenic development, was elucidated by characterizing a retrotransposon-tagged mutation of rice. The MSP1 gene encoded a Leu-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase. The msp1 mutation gave rise to an excessive number of both male and female sporocytes. In addition, the formation of anther wall layers was disordered and the tapetum layer was lost completely. Although the mutation never affected homologous chromosome pairing and chiasma maintenance, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at various stages of meiotic prophase I, which resulted in complete male sterility. Meanwhile, plural megaspore mother cells in a mutant ovule generated several megaspores, underwent gametogenesis, and produced germinable seeds when fertilized with wild-type pollen despite disorganized female gametophytes. In situ expression of MSP1 was detected in surrounding cells of male and female sporocytes and some flower tissues, but never in the sporocytes themselves. These results suggest that the MSP1 product plays crucial roles in restricting the number of cells entering into male and female sporogenesis and in initiating anther wall formation in rice.
8722567	Characterization of cDNA encoding for phosphoglucose isomerase of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	DNA Seq	Two types of genes (Pgi-a and Pgi-b) encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9) were cloned from cDNA libraries of rice cultured cells (Oryza sativa L.). Pgi-a and Pgi-b consisted of 2132 and 2030 nucleotides, respectively. The homology between these genes was 93.0% at nucleotide level. The homology scores between these genes in protein coding region and 3' non-coding region were 95.6% and 79.4%, respectively. PGI proteins encoded by Pgi-a and Pgi-b consisted of 567 and 568 amino acid, respectively, sharing 95.8% homology at amino acid sequences. Of 11 PGI genes from other plant species and organisms whose amino acid sequences had been determined, a dicotyledonous plant Clarkia lewisii PGI showed the highest homology (about 80%) with rice PGIs. GC contents at the third position of rice PGI genes were about 40%. In order to confirm the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Pgi-a was subcloned into an expression vector, pBluescript II SKp, which was introduced into Escherichia coli. The transformant had an additional PGI activity from Pgi-a.
2370848	The alpha-amylase genes in Oryza sativa: characterization of cDNA clones and mRNA expression during seed germination.	1990	Mol Gen Genet	Two cDNA clones, pOS103 and pOS137, were isolated which code for distinct alpha-amylase isozymes in germinating rice seeds. Sequence analysis indicated that the clones encode polypeptides of approximately 48 kDa, both of which possess a signal peptide involved in directing secretion of the protein. Comparison of the two rice alpha-amylase amino acid sequence showed that they are 76% similar to each other, while showing 85% to 90% similarity with other cereal alpha-amylases. A comparison of eleven cereal alpha-amylases also revealed three new conserved regions (I', II', and IV') not previously identified in the animal, bacterial, and fungal alpha-amylases. Regions I' and IV' are sites for intron splicing while region II' is probably involved in calcium binding. One of the rice alpha-amylase cDNAs, pOS103, encodes a protein that has two potential N-glycosylation sites, one in the signal peptide and the other in the mature portion of the protein. The cDNA clone, pOS137, encodes an alpha-amylase with a single glycosylation site in the signal peptide, suggesting that the mature OS137 isozyme is not glycosylated. Analysis of the expression of these genes in germinating rice seeds indicated that mRNA corresponding to pOS103 and pOS137 could be detected throughout a 48 h period of seed imbibition. RNA levels, however, were dramatically stimulated by treatment of embryoless half-seeds with exogenous GA3. Our results demonstrate that at least two forms of alpha-amylase are expressed in germinating rice seeds and that the expression of these genes is regulated by the phytohormone GA3.
10713441	Rice gibberellin-insensitive gene homolog, OsGAI, encodes a nuclear-localized protein capable of gene activation at transcriptional level.	2000	Gene	This paper reports isolation and properties of a rice gene, OsGAI, a putative homolog of the GAI of Arabidopsis thaliana. OsGAI encodes a polypeptide of 625 amino acids, which shows 53-55% identity to GAI and RGA from A. thaliana, and 85% identity to wheat rht-D1a and maize d8. Genomic DNA blot analysis indicated the OsGAI to be a single-copy gene in the rice genome. RNA blot hybridization showed that OsGAI transcripts increased within 6h upon GA(3) but not ABA application. This GA-induced increment in OsGAI transcripts did not require de novo protein synthesis. High levels of OsGAI transcripts were detected in nodes, internodes, leaf sheaths and ears of adult plants and leaf sheaths of young seedlings, where GA enhances cell elongation and division. Transiently expressed OsGAI-GFP fusion protein located to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells. Transactivation assays clearly indicated that OsGAI protein is a transcriptional activator or a coactivator.
15527966	Characterization of Oryza sativa telomerase reverse transcriptase and possible role of its phosphorylation in the control of telomerase activity.	2004	Gene	Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been characterized in the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana. A TERT homolog has now been identified in the monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa L.) on the basis of its predicted homology to the A. thaliana enzyme (AtTERT). At least five alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice TERT (OsTERT) gene were detected. The full-length OsTERT protein shares structural features with TERTs of other species, including a calculated molecular size of 144 kDa, an isoelectric point of 9.6, and conserved sequence motifs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsTERT clusters with AtTERT and is more related to the human and mouse enzymes than to those of yeast and ciliated protozoa, consistent with the evolutionary relations among these eukaryotes. Telomerase activity was abundant in shoot apices and cultured cells but was low or absent in leaves or roots of rice plants, whereas similarly spliced OsTERT transcripts were detected in all tissues examined and cultured cells. Similar to mouse and human TERT proteins, OsTERT contains two putative phosphorylation sites for Akt kinase. Incubation of a rice cell extract with Akt or with protein phosphatase 2A potentiated or inhibited telomerase activity, respectively, whereas Akt did not affect the activity in Arabidopsis cell extract. In addition, the kinase activated the telomerase in a leaf extract. The mechanism of telomerase regulation in rice thus appears to differ from that in Arabidopsis (which is mediated predominantly at the level of AtTERT transcription), possibly reflecting the taxonomic distance between monocotyledons and dicotyledons.
11470506	OsPAA2, a distinct alpha 1 subunit gene for the 20S proteasome in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2001	Gene	The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic complex that is involved in removing abnormal proteins and other diverse biological functions. The 20S proteasome is constituted of 28 subunits arranged in four rings of seven subunits, and exists as a hollow cylinder. The two outer rings and the two inner rings are composed of seven different alpha and beta type subunits, respectively, giving an alpha 7 beta 7 beta 7 alpha 7 structure. We previously reported the primary structures of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies in rice (Oryza sativa), representing the first set for all the subfamilies from monocot. In this study, a distinct cDNA sequence encoding the alpha1 subunit, OsPAA2, was identified. The amino acid sequence similarity between the two rice alpha1 subunits was as low as 59.6%, contrasting with those between paralogs of Arabidopsis proteasome subunit genes. The expression pattern of the OsPAA2 gene was different from that of another alpha1 gene, OsPAA1. These data suggest that OsPAA2 might play a distinct role from that of OsPAA1 in the 20S proteasome complex.
16202241	Cloning and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding glutamate decarboxylase.	2005	J Biochem Mol Biol	In this study, we have isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) glutamate decarboxylase (RicGAD) clone from a root cDNA library, using a partial Arabidopsis thaliana GAD gene as a probe. The rice root cDNA library was constructed with mRNA, which had been derived from the roots of rice seedlings subjected to phosphorus deprivation. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the RicGAD clone was 1,712 bp long, and harbors a complete open reading frame of 505 amino acids. The 505 amino acid sequence deduced from this RicGAD clone exhibited 67.7 % and 61.9 % identity with OsGAD1 (AB056060) and OsGAD2 (AB056061) in the database, respectively. The 505 amino acid sequence also exhibited 62.9, 64.1, and 64.2 % identity to Arabidopsis GAD (U9937), Nicotiana tabacum GAD (AF020425), and Petunia hybrida GAD (L16797), respectively. The RicGAD was found to possess a highly conserved tryptophan residue, but lacks the lysine cluster at the C-proximal position, as well as other stretches of positively charged residues. The GAD sequence was expressed heterologously using the high copy number plasmid, pVUCH. Our activation analysis revealed that the maximal activation of the RicGAD occurred in the presence of both Ca(2+) and calmodulin. The GAD-encoded 56 approximately 58 kDa protein was identified via Western blot analysis, using an anti-GAD monoclonal antibody. The results of our RT-PCR analyses revealed that RicGAD is expressed predominantly in rice roots obtained from rice seedlings grown under phosphorus deprivation conditions, and in non-germinated brown rice, which is known to have a limited phosphorus bioavailability. These results indicate that RicGAD is a Ca(2+)/ calmodulin-dependent enzyme, and that RicGAD is expressed primarily under phosphate deprivation conditions.
10778756	Diverse response of rice and maize genes encoding homologs of WPK4, an SNF1-related protein kinase from wheat, to light, nutrients, low temperature and cytokinins.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	The wheat gene WPK4 encodes a 56-kDa protein kinase that belongs to group 3 of the SNF1-related protein kinase family (SnRK3), and is up-regulated by light and cytokinins and down-regulated by sucrose. In order to determine whether or not this particular regulation pattern is general among plant species, we isolated and characterized homologous genes from rice and maize. Two rice genes, OsPK4 and OsPK7, encode proteins comprising 508 and 520 amino acids, and show, respectively, 75% and 76% sequence similarity to WPK4. OsPK4 and OsPK7 proteins produced in Escherichia coli were able to phosphorylate themselves and myelin basic proteins, the reaction requiring magnesium and/or manganese ions. Transcripts of OsPK4 were detected in all tissues tested, and amounts were increased upon illumination, nutrient deprivation and treatment with cytokinins. In contrast, transcripts of OsPK7 were not found in any tissues except in mature leaves at low levels, and did not accumulate under any of the stress conditions examined. A maize gene, ZmPK4, encodes a protein with 518 amino acids that shows 74% similarity to WPK4. Its transcripts were constitutively expressed in all tissues, regardless of light, nutrient and cytokinin status, but were increased upon exposure to low temperature. These results indicate that, despite the sequence similarity between their products, genes for SnRK3 proteins are differentially regulated in response to environmental stimuli.

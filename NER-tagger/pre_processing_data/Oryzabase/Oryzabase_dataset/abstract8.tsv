10773343	Xylem-specific expression of wound-inducible rice peroxidase genes in transgenic plants.	2000	Plant Sci	A peroxidase gene, poxA, was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic library. The gene consists of four exons whose combined sequences were identical to that of the prxRPA mRNA whose levels were dramatically stimulated by wounding as well as by treatment of rice shoots with ethephon or UV irradiation [H. Ito, F. Kimizuka, A. Ohbayashi, H. Matsui, M. Honma, A. Shinmyo, Y. Ohashi, A.B. Caplan, R.L. Rodriguez, Molecular cloning and characterization of two complementary DNAs encoding putative peroxidases from rice (Oryza sativa L.) shoots, Plant Cell Rep. 13 (1994) 361-366]. The temporal and spatial expression properties of the poxA gene promoter as well as that from a second related peroxidase gene, poxN, were analyzed in transgenic tobacco and rice plants using the uidA gene as a reporter. In transgenic tobacco, UV- and wound-responsive cis-elements were located within 144 bp from the translational start codon of the poxA gene. The poxN promoter, however, was inactive in the heterologous host as no significant GUS activity was evident. On the other hand, chimeric uidA genes containing 2.2 kb of the poxA promoter or 1.4 kb of poxN promoter were active in transgenic rice plants. Both peroxidase promoters directed GUS activities in a spatial and tissue specific manner coincident with the expression patterns exhibited by their mRNAs. Histochemical analysis of transgenic rice plants showed that both peroxidase genes are expressed in the vascular bundles of the shoot apex and lamina joint, and in xylem-parenchyma cells of the leaf blade and sheath.
11846882	Position dependent expression of GL2-type homeobox gene, Roc1: significance for protoderm differentiation and radial pattern formation in early rice embryogenesis.	2002	Plant J	In early plant embryogenesis, the determination of cell fate in the protodermal cell layer is considered to be the earliest event in radial pattern formation. To elucidate the mechanisms of epidermal cell fate determination and radial pattern formation in early rice embryogenesis, we have isolated a GL2-type homeobox gene Roc1 (Rice outermost cell-specific gene1), which is specifically expressed in the protoderm (epidermis). In early rice embryogenesis, cell division occurs randomly and the morphologically distinct layer structure of the protoderm cannot be observed until the embryo reaches more than 100 microm in length. Nonetheless, in situ hybridization analyses revealed that specific expression of Roc1 in the outermost cells is established shortly after fertilization, much earlier than protoderm differentiation. In the regeneration process from callus, the Roc1 gene is also expressed in the outermost cells of callus in advance of tissue and organ differentiation, and occurs independently of whether the cells will differentiate into epidermis in the future or not. Furthermore, this cell-specific Roc1 expression could be induced flexibly in the newly produced outermost cells when we cut the callus. These findings suggest that the expression of Roc1 in the outermost cells may be dependent on the positional information of cells in the embryo or callus prior to the cell fate determination of the protoderm (epidermis). Furthermore, the Roc1 expression is downregulated in the inner cells of ligule, which have previously been determined as protodermal cells, also suggesting that the Roc1 expression is position dependent and that this position dependent Roc1 expression is important also in post-embryonic protoderm (epidermis) differentiation.
9426242	Transcript levels of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes in rice are increased by low temperature.	1997	Gene	We identified two genes for alternative oxidase (AOX) from rice. One AOX gene (designated AOX1a) is located approx. 1.9 kb downstream of another AOX gene (designated AOX1b). Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences of the two AOX genes showed that the AOX1a gene is interrupted by three introns, as are AOX genes of other plants. On the other hand, two introns are inserted in the AOX1b gene. The predicted AOX1a and AOX1b precursor proteins consist of 332 and 335 amino acid residues, respectively. A genomic Southern hybridization analysis indicated that rice has several AOX genes other than the two tandem-arranged AOX genes. Steady-state mRNA levels of both of the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b were increased under low temperature (4 degrees C). However, no difference in the pattern of induction of transcription between the genes for AOX1a and AOX1b was observed.
10095070	Expression of novel homeobox genes in early embryogenesis in rice.	1999	Biochim Biophys Acta	We isolated four novel cDNA clones of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which encode predicted proteins with a KN1-like homeodomain. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis with solid cDNA libraries as templates showed that these genes are expressed in distinct patterns during the early stages of rice embryogenesis.
12034492	Organ-specific alternative transcripts of KNOX family class 2 homeobox genes of rice.	2002	Gene	We identified three genes (HOS58, HOS59 and HOS66) of rice (Oryza sativa), which encode predicted proteins with the KNOX family class 2 homeodomain. These proteins contain three conserved domains, the KNOX domain, ELK domain and homeodomain, from an N-terminus to a C-terminus. In addition to similarity of predicted amino acid sequences, these genes showed a similar exon/intron structure. cDNA cloning and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of these genes indicated tissue-specific expression of alternative transcripts. The expression of the longer mRNAs of HOS58 (HOS58L) and HOS59L was detected in all organs examined such as roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths, flowers and calli, whereas the shorter mRNAs of HOS58 (HOS58S) and HOS59S were expressed in leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flowers. The expression of HOS66L was detected in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flowers, whereas the expression of HOS66S was detected in roots and flowers. The alternative transcripts of HOS66 arose by use of alternative transcription start sites. The longer transcripts contained an exon 1 which encodes an alanine/glycine-rich region, whereas the shorter ones lacked it. These results suggest that the expression of the alternative transcripts is organ-specific, and their products have different degrees of abilities for activation or repression of transcription.
15094187	Radial axis differentiation in a globular embryo is marked by HAZ1, a PHD-finger homeobox gene of rice.	2004	Gene	Homeobox genes that encode transcription factors play important roles in development and differentiation of both plant and animal systems. From a cDNA library of 3-day after-pollination (DAP) rice embryos we cloned a HAZ1 cDNA that encodes a protein with a PHD-finger domain and a homeodomain. A database search showed that HAZ1 was most similar in its entire amino acid sequence to Zmhox1a (52% identity) and Zmhox1b (50%), PHD-finger family homeodomain proteins of maize. Differing from Zmhox1, overexpression of HAZ1 brought no morphological change either in tobacco or in rice. In situ hybridization showed that HAZ1 was expressed at a higher level in the outer layers of a developing embryo than in the inner parts of the embryo at 3 DAP. At 4 and 5 DAPs, the expression of HAZ1 was concentrated at the ventral part of an embryo. These results indicate that HAZ1 marks outer layer cells of a globular embryo before any morphological differentiation is discerned in it. Radial axis differentiation marked by HAZ1 is then collapsed dynamically along with embryo morphogenesis, and HAZ1 later marks the ventral surface of the embryo.
16081169	Expression of SERK family receptor-like protein kinase genes in rice.	2005	Biochim Biophys Acta	Some SERK-family receptor-like protein kinase genes have been shown to confer embryonic competence to cells. In this study, we isolated two novel rice genes, OsSERK1 and OsSERK2, belonging to the SERK-family. OsSERK2 showed constitutive expression. The OsSERK1 promoter showed reporter gene activities in some specific tissues in a germinating seed, leaf and root, but not in a developing embryo. This promoter activity suggests that OsSERK1 may have roles in non-embryonic tissues rather than in the embryo.
11438692	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers. We have used full-scan GC-MS and Kovats retention indices to show function for the two encoded recombinant fusion proteins. Both proteins show 3 beta-hydroxylase activity for the steps GA(20) to GA(1), GA(5) to GA(3), GA(44) to GA(38), and GA(9) to GA(4). In addition, indirect evidence suggests that the OsGA3ox1 protein also has 2,3-desaturase activity, which catalyzes the steps GA(9) to 2,3-dehydro-GA(9) and GA(20) to GA(5) (2,3-dehydro GA(20)), and 2 beta-hydroxylase activity, which catalyzes the steps GA(1) to GA(8) and GA(4) to GA(34). Molecular and linkage analysis maps the OsGA3ox1 gene to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5; the OsGA3ox2 gene maps to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1 that corresponds to the D18 locus. The association of the OsGA3ox2 gene with the d18 locus is confirmed by sequence and complementation analysis of three d18 alleles. Complementation of the d18-AD allele with the OxGA3ox2 gene results in transgenic plants with a normal phenotype. Although both genes show transient expression, the highest level for OsGA3ox1 is from unopened flower. The highest level for OsGA3ox2 is from elongating leaves.
7682174	Processing followed by complete editing of an altered mitochondrial atp6 RNA restores fertility of cytoplasmic male sterile rice.	1993	EMBO J	Two atp6 genes were found in the mitochondrial genome of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) rice carrying the [cms-bo] cytoplasm. One (N-atp6) was identical to the normal cytoplasmic gene, while the second (B-atp6) was identified as a candidate CMS gene by Southern analysis of the mitochondrial genome of CMS cybrid rice. The coding sequence of B-atp6 was identical to the normal N-atp6 gene but its 3'-flanking sequence was different starting at 49 bases downstream from the stop codon. Northern analysis showed that B-atp6 is transcribed into a 2.0 kb RNA in the absence of the Rf-1 gene, whereas two discontinuous RNAs, of approximately 1.5 and 0.45 kb, were detected in the presence of the Rf-1 gene. Determination of the 3' and 5' ends of these RNAs suggested that the two discontinuous RNAs were generated from the 2.0 kb RNA by RNA processing at sites within the B-atp6-specific sequences by the action of the Rf-1 gene. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones derived from the N-atp6 RNA and the processed and unprocessed RNAs of B-atp6 indicated that the processed B-atp6 RNAs were edited as efficiently as the N-atp6, whereas unedited and partially edited RNAs were detected among unprocessed RNAs. RNA processing by Rf-1 thus influences the sequential post-transcriptional editing of the B-atp6 RNAs. Because the unprocessed RNAs of B-atp6 are possibly translated into altered polypeptides, our results suggest that interaction of RNA processing and editing plays a role in controlling CMS expression and the restoration of fertility in rice.
12451175	A pectin glucuronyltransferase gene is essential for intercellular attachment in the plant meristem.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Intercellular attachment is an essential process in the morphogenesis of multicellular organisms. A unique mutant, nolac-H18 (nonorganogenic callus with loosely attached cells), generated by T-DNA transformation using leaf-disk cultures of haploid Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, lost the ability to form tight intercellular attachments and adventitious shoots. The gene tagged with T-DNA, named NpGUT1 (glucuronyltransferase 1), was similar to the gene for the catalytic domains of animal glucuronyltransferases and was expressed predominantly in shoot and root apical meristems. The transformation of NpGUT1 complemented the nolac-H18 mutation, and the expression of antisense NpGUT1 RNA produced crumbled shoots. The mutation caused defects in the glucuronic acid of rhamnogalacturonan II of pectin, which drastically reduced the formation of borate cross-linking of rhamnogalacturonan II. NpGUT1, which encodes a unique glucuronyltransferase, is a glycosyltransferase gene identified in pectin biosynthesis and is essential for intercellular attachment in plant meristems and tissues.
12059099	Enhanced resistance to seed-transmitted bacterial diseases in transgenic rice plants overproducing an oat cell-wall-bound thionin.	2002	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Bacterial attack is a serious agricultural problem for growth of rice seedlings in the nursery and field. The thionins purified from seed and etiolated seedlings of barley are known to have antimicrobial activity against necrotrophic pathogens; however, we found that no endogenous rice thionin genes alone are enough for resistance to two major seed-transmitted phytopathogenic bacteria, Burkholderia plantarii and B. glumae, although rice thionin genes constitutively expressed in coleoptile, the target organ of the bacteria. Thus, we isolated thionin genes from oat, one of which was overexpressed in rice. When wild-type rice seed were germinated with these bacteria, all seedlings were wilted with severe blight. In the seedling infected with B. plantarii, bacterial staining was intensively marked around stomata and intercellular spaces. However, transgenic rice seedlings accumulating a high level of oat thionin in cell walls grew almost normally with bacterial staining only on the surface of stomata. These results indicate that the oat thionin effectively works in rice plants against bacterial attack.
9055819	Cloning of cDNA encoding the rice 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and analysis of light-induced expression of the gene.	1997	Gene	Cloning of rice cDNA encoding the chlorophyll-binding 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and the light-induced expression of the gene are reported. One of the light-responsive cDNA clones, isolated by screening with a light-specific subtracted cDNA probe, was shown to encode PSII-S of rice. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that the PSII-S gene, psbS, is a single-copy gene in rice. A brief exposure to red light induced a severalfold increase in the steady state level of PSII-S transcripts in etiolated seedlings. The red light effect was reversed by far-red light, suggesting involvement of phytochrome in the PSII-S gene regulation. Prolonged exposure (3 h) to blue light, however, revealed a much stronger effect than red light on the accumulation of PSII-S transcripts in the etiolated seedlings. In dark-adapted green plants, prolonged exposure to blue light induced re-accumulation of transcripts encoding PSII-S, whereas red light had little effect.
9654145	A novel importin alpha from rice, a component involved in the process of nuclear protein transport.	1998	FEBS Lett	In eukaryotes, nuclear proteins that are transported into nuclei have nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are recognized by proteins called importin alpha. We isolated a rice cDNA, #61L, and the corresponding gene that encodes a protein, which shows significant homology to the importin alpha. Although the encoded protein had only 23-27% amino acid identity to the importin alphas from various organisms including plants, the fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase showed a specific binding activity to the NLS of SV40 T-antigen. These results suggest that the rice #61L protein is a novel importin alpha in plants.
7757340	Molecular cloning and characterization of cDNA for a rice protein that contains seven repetitive segments of the Trp-Asp forty-amino-acid repeat (WD-40 repeat).	1995	Plant Cell Physiol	A cDNA clone for a polypeptide that contained seven repetitive segments of the Trp-Asp forty-amino-acid repeat (WD-40 repeat) was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from the greening leaves of rice. The cDNA was 1,285 bp long and contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 334 amino acid residues, which was designated it RWD (rice protein containing the WD-40 repeat). RWD exhibited greater homology to a group of receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK), a product of auxin-regulated gene from cultured cells (arcA) and a Chlamydomonas beta subunit-like polypeptide (Cblp) rather than to the beta subunits of heterotrimeric G protein complexes. The mRNA for RWD (1.3 kb) was found in all organs of rice plants, in particular, in roots. Therefore, RWD is suggested to be a protein that is expressed constitutively.
15597740	The rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa5 encodes a novel form of disease resistance.	2004	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The rice xa5 gene for disease resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae has been positionally cloned and encodes the gamma subunit of transcription factor IIA (TFIIAgamma). TFIIAgamma is a general eukaryotic transcription factor with no previously known role in disease resistance. xa5 is unusual in that it is recessive and does not conform to one of the typical resistance gene structural classes. Sequencing of TFIIAgamma in resistant and susceptible isolines revealed two nucleotide substitutions resulting in an amino acid change between resistant and susceptible cultivars. This association was conserved across 27 resistant and nine susceptible rice lines in the Aus-Boro group.
7919992	The rice bZIP transcriptional activator RITA-1 is highly expressed during seed development.	1994	Plant Cell	Systematic protein-DNA binding studies have shown that plant basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins exhibit a differential binding specificity for ACGT motifs. Here, we show that the rice transcription activator-1 (RITA-1) displays a broad binding specificity for palindromic ACGT elements, being able to bind A-, C-, and G-box but not T-box elements. By using gel mobility shift assays with probes differing in sequences flanking the hexameric core, we identified high-affinity A-, C-, and G-box binding sites. Quantitative and competition DNA binding studies confirmed RITA-1 specificity for these sites. Using rice protoplasts as a transient expression system, we demonstrated that RITA-1 can transactivate reporter genes possessing high-affinity but not low-affinity RITA-1 binding sites. Our results established a direct relationship between in vivo transactivation and in vitro binding activity. Transient expression assays that demonstrated the ability of RITA-1 to transactivate a construct containing rita-1 5' flanking sequences suggest that the factor may be autoregulated. Histochemical analysis of transgenic rice plants showed that a rita-1-beta-glucuronidase transgene is expressed in aleurone and endosperm cells of developing rice seeds. We propose that RITA-1 plays a role in the regulation of rice genes expressed in developing rice seeds.
1376283	Nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone encoding a major allergenic protein in rice seeds. Homology of the deduced amino acid sequence with members of alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family.	1992	FEBS Lett	A cDNA clone of rice major allergenic protein (RAP) was isolated from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds. The cDNA had an open reading frame (486 nucleotides) which coded a 162 amino acid residue polypeptide comprising a 27-residue signal peptide and a 135-residue mature protein of M(r) 14,764. The deduced amino acid sequence of RAP showed a considerable similarity to barley trypsin inhibitor [1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7998-8003] and wheat alpha-amylase inhibitor [1981, Phytochemistry 20, 1781-1784].
15516498	Characterization of a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase gene that is up-regulated by gibberellin in rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	Xyloglucan endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that mediate cleavage and rejoining of the beta (1-4)-xyloglucans of the primary cell wall are considered to play an important role in the construction and restructuring of xyloglucan cross-links. A novel rice (Oryza sativa) XTH-related gene, OsXTH8, was cloned and characterized after being identified by cDNA microarray analysis of gibberellin-induced changes in gene expression in rice seedlings. OsXTH8 was a single copy gene; its full-length cDNA was 1,298 bp encoding a predicted protein of 290 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsXTH8 falls outside of the three established subfamilies of XTH-related genes. OsXTH8 was preferentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in response to gibberellic acid. In situ hybridization and OsXTH8 promoter GUS fusion analysis revealed that OsXTH8 was highly expressed in vascular bundles of leaf sheath and young nodal roots where the cells are actively undergoing elongation and differentiation. OsXTH8 gene expression was up-regulated by gibberellic acid and there was very little effect of other hormones. In two genetic mutants of rice with abnormal height, the expression of OsXTH8 positively correlated with the height of the mutants. Transgenic rice expressing an RNAi construct of OsXTH8 exhibited repressed growth. These results indicate that OsXTH8 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to gibberellin and potentially involved in cell elongation processes.
12177461	High-level and ubiquitous expression of the rice cytochrome c gene OsCc1 and its promoter activity in transgenic plants provides a useful promoter for transgenesis of monocots.	2002	Plant Physiol	Expression patterns of a rice (Oryza sativa) cytochrome c gene OsCc1 and its promoter activity were characterized in transgenic rice plants. OsCc1 transcripts accumulate in most cell types, but to varying levels. Large amounts of OsCc1 transcripts are found in the roots, calli, and suspension cells, but relatively lower in mature leaves, demonstrating its higher levels of expression in non-photosynthetic tissues. Unlike the human cytochrome c gene, which is responsive to cAMP, OsCc1 expression is not enhanced in various rice tissues after dibutyryl cAMP treatments. OsCc1 promoter was linked to the sgfp gene and its activities in different tissues and cell types of transgenic rice plants were analyzed in comparison with the Act1 and RbcS promoters. OsCc1 promoter directs expression in virtually all organs of transgenic plants including roots, leaves, calli, embryos, and suspension cells, showing a particularly high activity in calli and roots. Activity of the OsCc1 promoter was 3-fold higher than Act1 in calli and roots and comparable with RbcS in leaves, representing a useful alternative to the maize (Zea mays) Ubi1 and the rice Act1 promoters for transgene expression in monocots.
14750524	The OsFOR1 gene encodes a polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) that regulates floral organ number in rice.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated a cDNA clone, OsFOR1, from the immature panicles of rice. The OsFOR1 (Oryza sativa floral organ regulator 1) gene encodes a protein that contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. This domain comprises 10 tandem repeats of a canonical 24-amino acid LRR sequence. The structure and the number of LRRs for OsFOR1 are similar to those of polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) from various other plant species. Moreover, the OsFOR1 recombinant protein, when fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), shows PGIP activity against the Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase. OsFOR1 is highly expressed in the calli and immature and mature panicles, while detectable at only low levels in seedling roots and mature stems. In situ hybridization experiments showed the transcripts of OsFOR1 are present in young spikelet primordia and in almost all of the young floral organs. Transgenic approaches were used to study in vivo functioning. Antisense expression of OsFOR1 resulted in an increase in the numbers of floral organs, including the stamen, carpel, palea/lemma, stigma, and lodicule. OsFOR1 transcript was not detected in the frizzy panicle mutant, which is defective in its spikelet formation but normal in inflorescence-meristem initiation and maintenance. Therefore, we suggest that OsFOR1 plays a role in the formation and/or maintenance of floral organ primordia.
10080707	Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1999	Plant Mol Biol	An anther-specific cDNA clone of rice, RA8, was isolated from an anther cDNA library by differential screening. RNA blot analysis indicated that the RA8 transcript is present specifically in anthers and the transcript level increased as flowers matured, reaching the highest level in mature flowers. The RA8 clone contains an open reading frame of 264 amino acid residues with a hydrophobic N-terminal region. The deduced amino acid sequences did not show significant homology to any known sequences. Genomic DNA blot analysis showed that RA8 is a single-copy gene. A genomic clone corresponding to the RA8 cDNA was isolated and its promoter region was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. Transgenic rice plants exhibited anther-specific expression of the GUS reporter gene. Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers. Experiments showed that expression of the gene starts when microspores are released from tetrads, and it reaches to the maximum level at the late vacuolated-pollen stage. The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants.
10852934	leafy hull sterile1 is a homeotic mutation in a rice MADS box gene affecting rice flower development.	2000	Plant Cell	Rice contains several MADS box genes. It has been demonstrated previously that one of these genes, OsMADS1 (for Oryza sativa MADS box gene1), is expressed preferentially in flowers and causes early flowering when ectopically expressed in tobacco plants. In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of OsMADS1 in rice also results in early flowering. To further investigate the role of OsMADS1 during rice flower development, we generated transgenic rice plants expressing altered OsMADS1 genes that contain missense mutations in the MADS domain. There was no visible alteration in the transgenic plants during the vegetative stage. However, transgenic panicles typically exhibited phenotypic alterations, including spikelets consisting of elongated leafy paleae and lemmas that exhibit a feature of open hull, two pairs of leafy palea-like and lemma-like lodicules, a decrease in stamen number, and an increase in the number of carpels. In addition, some spikelets generated an additional floret from the same rachilla. These characteristics are very similar to those of leafy hull sterile1 (lhs1). The map position of OsMADS1 is closely linked to that of lhs1 on chromosome 3. Examination of lhs1 revealed that it contains two missense mutations in the OsMADS1 MADS domain. A genetic complementation experiment showed that the 11.9-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type OsMADS1 gene rescued the mutant phenotypes. In addition, ectopic expression of the OsMADS1 gene isolated from the lhs1 line resulted in lhs1-conferred phenotypes. These lines of evidence demonstrate that OsMADS1 is the lhs1 gene.
15983871	Structure, evolution, and expression of the two invertase gene families of rice.	2005	J Mol Evol	Invertases catalyze the irreversible hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose. Plants contain two unrelated families of these enzymes: acid forms that derive from periplasmic invertases of eubacteria and are found in cell wall and vacuole, and neutral/alkaline forms evolved from the cytosolic invertases of cyanobacteria. Genomes of rice (Oryza sativa) and thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) contain multiple genes encoding these two families. Here for rice we identify the member genes of a cell-wall group (designated OsCIN1-9), a vacuolar group (OsVIN1-2), and two ancient neutral/alkaline groups: alpha (OsNIN1-4) and beta (OsNIN5-8). In Arabidopsis these groups contain six, two, four and five members, respectively. It is believed that the vacuolar group evolved from the cell-wall group. We provide evidence that the N-terminal signal peptide that directs cell-wall invertases co-translationally into the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion was replaced in the vacuolar group by a sequence similar to the complex N-terminal motif that targets alkaline phosphatase post-translationally to the vacuolar membrane of yeast. Since the last common ancestor of Arabidopsis and rice, the two invertase families evolved equally rapidly via gene duplication and gene loss, but the acid invertase family underwent approximately 10 events of intron loss compared with a single event of intron gain in the neutral/alkaline invertase family. Transcripts were detected for all rice invertase genes except OsCIN9. The acid invertase genes showed greater spatial and temporal diversity of expression than the neutral/alkaline genes.
12475618	Isolation and characterization of two fructokinase cDNA clones from rice.	2003	Phytochemistry	Two cDNA clones, OsFKI and OsFKII, encoding fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) were isolated from immature seeds of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by PCR. OsFKI cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 323 amino acids that was 59-71% identical to previously characterized plant fructokinases. In contrast, OsFKII cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 336 amino acids that shared only 64% amino acid identity with OsFKI. The deduced proteins both possessed an ATP-binding motif and putative substrate recognition site sequences that were previously identified in bacterial fructokinases. Genomic DNA blot analysis also revealed that each fructokinase gene exists as a single copy in the rice genome. The identity of OsFKI and OsFKII as fructokinases was confirmed by the expression of enzyme activity in E. coli. Although both OsFKI and OsFKII utilized fructose as substrate, only OsFKII activity was strongly inhibited at a high fructose concentration. The mRNA corresponding to OsFKII accumulated at high levels in developing rice grains, whereas there were only low levels of OsFKI transcripts in immature seeds. These results indicate that fructokinase in rice endosperm is encoded by two divergent genes, which play different roles in rice grains for starch storage based on their sensitivity to substrate inhibition and level of transcripts in endosperm.
15849305	A novel short-root gene encodes a glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase required for maintaining normal root cell shape in rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification occurring in many secreted and membrane-associated proteins in eukaryotes. It plays important roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Most of these protein modifications depend on UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. In this study, a T-DNA insertional rice (Oryza sativa) mutant exhibiting a temperature-sensitive defect in root elongation was isolated. Genetic and molecular analysis indicated that the mutated phenotype was caused by loss of function of a gene encoding a glucosamine-6-P acetyltransferase (designated OsGNA1), which is involved in de novo UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis. The aberrant root morphology of the gna1 mutant includes shortening of roots, disruption of microtubules, and shrinkage of cells in the root elongation zone. Our observations support the idea that protein glycosylation plays a key role in cell metabolism, microtubule stabilization, and cell shape in rice roots.
15169941	Identification and molecular characterization of myosin gene family in Oryza sativa genome.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Myosins play an important role in various developmental processes in plants. We have identified 14 myosin genes in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) genome using sequence information available in public databases. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences with other plant and non-plant myosins revealed that two of the predicted sequences belonged to class VIII and the others to class XI. All of these genes were distributed on seven chromosomes in the rice genome. Domain searches on these sequences indicated that a typical rice myosin consisted of Myosin_N, head domain, neck (IQ motifs), tail, and dilute (DIL) domain. Based on the sequence information obtained from predicted myosins, we isolated and sequenced two full-length cDNAs, OsMyoVIIIA and OsMyoXIE, representing each of the two classes of myosins. These two cDNAs isolated from different organs existed in isoforms due to differential splicing and showed minor differences from the predicted myosin in exon organization. Out of 14 myosin genes 11 were expressed in three major organs: leaves, panicles, and roots, among which three myosins exhibited different expression levels. On the other hand, three of the total myosin sequences showed organ-specific expression. The existence of different myosin genes and their isoforms in different organs or tissues indicates the diversity of myosin functions in rice.
15952069	The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage. The mutant phenotype showed linkage to Ds insertion into Osnop gene region. This mutant contained a deletion of 65 kb chromosomal region at the site of Ds insertion containing 14 predicted genes. Out of these deleted genes, Delegen 5-7, 9-10 were redundant, as two or three copies were present with 100% homology in other regions of rice genome. RT-PCR analysis showed that Delegen 5-7 were expressed not only in wild type plants but also in the mutant plants. In addition to this, Delegen 8-10 transcripts could not be detected under normal growth conditions, and Delegen 12 was expressed only in roots, thus deletion of these genes may not affect the pollen development. Our data and analysis also ruled out the possibility of delegen 1-4, 11, and 13 as candidates contributing to the pollen-less phenotype. Further investigation showed that the delegen 14 was expressed only in late stage of pollen development with the highest expression at the stage of pollen release and germination by RT-PCR, Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, and promoter-GUS transgenic plants. Thus, the delegen 14 gene is the best candidate for Osnop, corresponding to the pollen-less phenotype in the mutant. Our data suggest that delegen 14 may play an important role during late stage of pollen development and its germination. Since the delegen 14 gene has both C(2) and GRAM domains, it can be assumed that this gene cross-links both calcium and phosphoinositide signaling pathways. This is the first report to suggest possible functions for this gene in plant development.
9517002	Isolation and characterization of a water stress-specific genomic gene, pwsi 18, from rice.	1998	Plant Cell Physiol	One of the water stress-specific cDNA clones of rice characterised previously, wsi18, was selected for further study. The wsi18 gene can be induced by water stress conditions such as mannitol, NaCl, and dryness, but not by ABA, cold, or heat. A genomic clone for wsi18, pwsi18, contained about 1.7 kbp of the 5' upstream sequence, two introns, and the full coding sequence. The 5'-upstream sequence of pwsi18 contained putative cis-acting elements, namely an ABA-responsive element (ABRE), three G-boxes, three E-boxes, a MEF-2 sequence, four direct and two inverted repeats, and four sequences similar to DRE, which is involved in the dehydration response of Arabidopsis genes. The gusA reporter gene under the control of the pwsi18 promoter showed transient expression in response to water stress. Deletion of the downstream DRE-like sequence between the distal G-boxes-2 and -3 resulted in rather low GUS expression.
15047876	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	EIN2 is a central signal transducer in the ethylene-signaling pathway, and a unique membrane-anchored protein. By screening a cDNA library, we have isolated a cDNA clone (OsEIN2) that encodes the rice EIN2 homolog. The full-length ORF clone was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. OsEIN2 shares significant amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis EIN2 (57% similarity and 42% identity). Both the numbers and positions of introns and exons in the OsEIN2 and AtEIN2 coding regions are also conserved. To address whether this structural similarity is indicative of functional conservation of the corresponding proteins, we also generated transgenic lines expressing the antisense construct of OsEIN2. Those plants were stunted and shoot elongation was severely inhibited. Their phenotypes were similar to that found with wild-type rice seedlings that were treated with AgNO3, an ethylene signal inhibitor. In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types. These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis: Our antisense transgenic plants produced approximately 3.5 times more ethylene than the wild-type plants. Expression analysis of rice ACS and ACO genes showed that the transcript levels of OsACS1 and OsACO1 were elevated in the transgenic plants.
16141453	Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development.	2005	Plant Cell	The tapetum, the innermost of four sporophytic layers in the anther wall, comes in direct contact with the developing male gametophyte and is thought to play a crucial role in the development and maturation of microspores. Here, we report the identification of rice (Oryza sativa) Undeveloped Tapetum1 (Udt1), which is required for the differentiation of secondary parietal cells to mature tapetal cells. T-DNA or retrotransposon Tos17 insertions in the Udt1 gene caused male sterility. The anther walls and meiocytes of the mutants were normal during the early premeiosis stage, but their tapeta failed to differentiate and became vacuolated during the meiotic stage. In addition, meiocytes did not develop to microspores, and middle layer degeneration was inhibited. Consequently, the anther locules contained no pollen. The UDT1:green fluorescent protein fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. This, together with its homology with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins, suggests that UDT1 is a transcription factor. DNA microarray analysis identified 958 downregulated and 267 upregulated genes in the udt1-1 anthers, suggesting that Udt1 plays a major role in maintaining tapetum development, starting in early meiosis.
11527396	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel Jasmonate inducible pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, JIOsPR10, from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedling leaves.	2001	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene, homologous to a sorghum pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from 2-week-old jasmonic acid-treated rice seedling leaves, and named as JIOsPR10 (jasmonate inducible). JIOsPR10 encoded a 160-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 17,173.23 Da and a pI of 5.84. JIOsPR10 was highly similar (77%) to the sorghum PR10 protein, but showed less than 55% similarity with other identified PR10s at the amino acid level. Genomic Southern analyses indicated the presence of related genes in the rice genome. The JIOsPR10 transcript was not detected in the healthy leaves, and was not induced after cut. Further expression analysis revealed that the signaling components of defense/stress pathways, jasmonate, salicylate, and H(2)O(2) significantly up-regulated the JIOsPR10 mRNA over the cut control, whereas two other stress regulators, ethylene and abscisic acid, failed to induce its expression. Interestingly the protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, cantharidin, endothall, and okadaic acid, rapidly and potently up-regulated the JIOsPR10 expression, suggesting involvement of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Additionally, the inducible expression of the JIOsPR10 gene was influenced by light signal(s). Finally, the blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) also specifically elicited the accumulation of JIOsPR10 mRNA in leaves. Induction of the JIOsPR10 gene expression by signaling molecules, PP inhibitors and pathogen attack, strongly indicate a role for this novel gene in rice self-defense/stress response(s).
8978691	Targeting presequence acquisition after mitochondrial gene transfer to the nucleus occurs by duplication of existing targeting signals.	1996	EMBO J	We have cloned a gene for mitochondrial ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), which is encoded in lower plants by the mitochondrial genome, in higher plants by the nuclear genome, demonstrating genetic information transfer from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus during flowering plant evolution. The sequence s11-1 encodes an N-terminal extension as well as an organelle-derived RPS11 region. Surprisingly, the N-terminal region has high amino acid sequence similarity with the presequence of the beta-subunit of ATP synthase from plant mitochondria, suggesting a common lineage of the presequences. The deduced N-terminal region of s11-2, a second nuclear-encoded homolog of rps11, shows high sequence similarity with the putative presequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit Vb. The sharing of the N-terminal region together with its 5' flanking untranslated nucleotide sequence in different proteins strongly suggests an involvement of duplication/recombination for targeting signal acquisition after gene migration. A remnant of ancestral rps11 sequence, transcribed and subjected to RNA editing, is found in the mitochondrial genome, indicating that inactivation of mitochondrial rps11 gene expression was initiated at the translational level prior to termination of transcription.
9057336	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA for plastidic copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	A cDNA encoding plastidic Cu/Zn-SOD was isolated from rice. The deduced amino acid sequence included a transit peptide in the amino-terminal residues and showed a high similarity to those of plastidic Cu/Zn-SODs from other plants. The level of expression of this transcript was high in green leaves and differed from that of other rice SOD mRNAs in various tissues.
10050312	Gene cloning and expression of cytosolic glutathione reductase in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1998	Plant Cell Physiol	We have isolated a cDNA (RGRC2) encoding glutathione reductase (GR) from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The comparison of deduced amino acid sequences from RGRC2 and other plant GR cDNAs indicated that RGRC2 encodes a putative cytosolic isoform. The recombinant RGRC2 protein had enzymatic properties comparable to those of GR from rice embryo. Subcellular fractionation showed that the RGRC2 protein is localized primarily in cytosol. mRNA and protein of RGRC2 were observed mainly in roots and calli but little in leaf tissues. Southern blot analysis showed that the RGRC2 gene exists as a single copy gene. Here, we have also isolated a genomic clone completely corresponding to RGRC2. The RGRC2 gene is split into 16 exons spread about 7.4 kb of chromosomal DNA, with coding sequence beginning in the 2nd exon and ending in the 16th exon. From the presence of two ABA-responsive elements in the 5'-flanking region of RGRC2, we examined the expression in rice seedlings treated with ABA and the ABA-related environmental stresses, chilling, drought and salinity. The expression of RGRC2 was strongly induced by all these treatments. We suggest that the expression of the rice cytosolic GR gene is regulated via ABA-mediated signal transduction pathway under environmental stresses.
10192910	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA for an iron-superoxide dismutase in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1999	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We have isolated a cDNA encoding Fe-SOD from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The deduced amino acid sequence consists of a polypeptide with 255 amino acids, including a putative transit peptide (40 a.a.) in amino-terminal residues. This sequence is similar to the known plant Fe-SODs but not classified in the group of known Fe-SODs. The metal analysis and SOD assays of the partial purified recombinant protein expressed in E. coli showed that this cDNA encodes an iron-containing SOD. However this SOD activity was not inhibited by the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, which was expected to inhibit known Fe-SOD activity. mRNA of rice Fe-SOD was detected in all vegetative tissues examined, being especially abundant in calli, and strongly increased by light induction. These results suggested that this cDNA encodes rice Fe-SOD, which is apparently distinct from known plant Fe-SODs.
11118226	A recurrent general RNA binding domain appended to plant methionyl-tRNA synthetase acts as a cis-acting cofactor for aminoacylation.	2000	EMBO J	The cDNA encoding rice methionyl-tRNA synthetase was isolated. The protein exhibited a C-terminal polypeptide appended to a classical MetRS domain. This supplementary domain is related to endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAPII), a cytokine produced in mammals after cleavage of p43, a component of the multisynthetase complex. It is also related to Arc1p and Trbp111, two tRNA binding proteins. We expressed rice MetRS and a derivative with a deletion of its EMAPII-like domain. Band-shift analysis showed that this extra-domain provides MetRS with non-specific tRNA binding properties. The EMAPII-like domain contributed a 10-fold decrease in K:(M) for tRNA in the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by the native enzyme, as compared with the C-terminally truncated MetRS. Consequently, the EMAPII domain provides MetRS with a better catalytic efficiency at the free tRNA concentration prevailing in vivo. This domain binds the acceptor minihelix of tRNA(Met) and facilitates its aminoacylation. These results suggest that the EMAPII module could be a relic of an ancient tRNA binding domain that was incorporated into primordial synthetases for aminoacylation of RNA minihelices taken as the ancestor of modern tRNA.
7816019	Physical mapping of the 5S ribosomal RNA genes on rice chromosome 11.	1994	Mol Gen Genet	One 5S ribosomal RNA gene (5S rDNA) locus was localized on chromosome 11 of japonica rice by in situ hybridization. The biotinylated DNA probe used was prepared by direct cloning and direct labeling methods, and the locus was localized to the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p1.1) by imaging methods. The distance between the signal site and the centromere is 4.0 arbitrary units, where the total length of the short arm is 43.3 units. The 5SrDNA locus physically identified and mapped in rice was designated as 5SRrn. The position of the 5S rDNA locus reported here differs from that in indica rice; possible reasons for this difference are discussed. DNA sequences of 5S rDNA are also reported.
12974810	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants.	2003	Plant J	Asymmetric cell division is one of the most important mechanisms in the diversification of cell function and fate. In Arabidopsis, SCARECROW (SCR) is essential for the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell in the root. To learn more about how SCR is involved in asymmetric division, we analyzed the rice SCR (OsSCR) expression. In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR. In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation. In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs. Before the second asymmetric division of subsidiary mother cells (SMCs), localized OsSCR expression was observed in SMCs in the area close to the GMCs. Before these asymmetric divisions, the localization of OsSCR mRNA in GMC-forming cells and SMCs was observed in the area of the daughter GMC and subsidiary cells. OsSCR expression was also observed in the initiation area of ligule formation, and its downregulation occurred in the inner L2 cells generated by asymmetric division. Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm.
14561741	Residues in internal repeats of the rice cation/H+ exchanger are involved in the transport and selection of cations.	2004	J Biol Chem	In plants, the cation/H+ exchanger (CAX) translocates Ca2+ and other metal ions into vacuoles using the H+ gradient formed by H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase. Such exchangers carrying 11 transmembrane domains (TMs) have been isolated from plants, yeast, and bacteria. In this study, multiple sequence alignment of several CAXs revealed the presence of highly conserved 36-residue regions between TM3 and TM4 and between TM8 and TM9. These two repetitive motifs are designated repeats c-1 and c-2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated 31 mutations in the repeats of the Oryza sativa CAX, which translocates Ca2+ and Mn2+. Mutant exchangers were expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that is sensitive to Ca2+ and Mn2+ because of the absence of vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+/H+ exchanger. Mutant exchangers were classified into six classes according to their tolerance for Ca2+ and Mn2+. For example, the class III mutants had no tolerance for either ion, and the class IV mutants had tolerance only for Ca2+. The biochemical function of each residue was estimated. We investigated the membrane topology of the repeats using a method combining cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl reagents. Our results suggest that repeat c-1 re-enters the membrane from the vacuolar luminal side and forms a solution-accessible region. Furthermore, several residues in repeats c-1 and c-2 were found to be conserved in animal Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Finally, we suggest that these re-entrant repeats may form a vestibule or filter for cation selection.
16087344	Expressions of rice sucrose non-fermenting-1 related protein kinase 1 genes are differently regulated during the caryopsis development.	2005	Plant Physiol Biochem	The rice sucrose non-fermenting-1 related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) family consists of three genes, which were named OSK1, OSK24 and OSK35. In order to elucidate the distinct functions of OSK genes, we identified precise regions for their expression by the promoter: GUS expression analyses as well as in situ mRNA localization experiments. At first, we isolated genomic clones corresponding to each member of OSKs in order to obtain the promoter sequences. All OSK genes house 11 exons and 10 introns and the positions of introns within the coding regions are fully conserved in all these genes. Histochemical analyses using OSK promoter: beta-glucronidase (OSKP:GUS) reporter genes showed that expression patterns of OSK1P:GUS and OSK24P:GUS were quite different in the developing caryopsis. The expression of OSK1P:GUS was nearly restricted in the vascular tissues during the caryopsis development. In contrast, the OSK24P:GUS expression was detected in the pericarp at the early stage with a shift to the endosperm as the endosperm cells were formed, and GUS staining was confined to both aleurone layer and endosperm cells around 15 days after flowering, when cell division of cellular endosperm were almost finished. The shifting pattern of the OSK24 expression was correlated with the appearance of starch granules in each tissue. Similar correlation between OSK24 expression and emergence of starch granules was also observed at another temporal sink organ, the basal part of leaf sheath. These results suggest that OSK24 (rice SnRK1b) most probably have a special role in carbohydrate metabolism of the sink organs.
9085264	Isolation and characterization of a rice MADS box gene belonging to the AGL2 gene family.	1997	Mol Cells	The MADS box genes that encode regulatory proteins play important roles in both the formation of flower meristem and the determination of floral organ identity. We have characterized a flower-specific cDNA that belongs to the AGL2 gene family from rice, designated OsMADS5. The cDNA displays the structure of a typical plant MADS box gene, which consists of a MADS domain, K domain, a short I region between the MADS and K domain, and the C-terminal region downstream of the K domain. The gene was classified as a member of the AGL2 gene family from sequence homology analysis. The OsMADS5 protein is the most similar to OsMADS1 of rice (72% identity). In spatial and temporal RNA blot analyses, the OsMADS5 gene was expressed preferentially in anthers and weakly in carpels. During flower development, the gene was more highly expressed in the early floral stage than in the late. To study the functions of the gene, the cDNA clone was expressed ectopically using the CaMV 35S promoter in a heterologous tobacco plant system. Transgenic plants of OsMADS5 exhibited the phenotype of weak dwarfism and early flowering. These results indicate that OsMADS5 is structurally related to the AGL2 family and may be involved in controlling flowering time.
7579155	Phenotypic alterations of petal and sepal by ectopic expression of a rice MADS box gene in tobacco.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Floral organ development is controlled by a group of regulatory factors containing the MADS domain. In this study, we have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone from rice, OsMADS3, which encodes a MADS-domain containing protein. The OsMADS3 amino acid sequence shows over 60% identity to AG of Arabidopsis, PLE of Antirrhinum majus, and AG/PLE homologues of petunia, tobacco, tomato, Brassica napus, and maize. Homology in the MADS box region is most conserved. RNA blot analysis indicated that the rice MADS gene was preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in stamen and carpel. In situ localization studies showed that the transcript was present primarily in stamen and carpel. The function of the rice OsMADS3 was elucidated by ectopic expression of the gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter in a heterologous tobacco plant system. Transgenic plants exhibited an altered morphology and coloration of the perianth organs. Sepals were pale green and elongated. Limbs of the corolla were split into sections which in some plants became antheroid structures attached to tubes that resembled filaments. The phenotypes mimic the results of ectopic expression of dicot AG gene or AG homologues. These results indicate that the OsMADS3 gene is possibly an AG homologue and that the AG genes appear to be structurally and functionally conserved between dicot and monocot.
9339904	Characterization of two rice MADS box genes that control flowering time.	1997	Mol Cells	Plants contain a variety of the MADS box genes that encode regulatory proteins and play important roles in both the formation of flower meristem and the determination of floral organ identity. We have characterized two flower-specific cDNAs from rice, designated OsMADS7 and OsMADS8. The cDNAs displayed the structure of a typical plant MADS box gene, which consists of the MADS domain, I region, K domain, and C-terminal region. These genes were classified as members of the AGL2 gene family based on sequence homology. The OsMADS7 and 8 proteins were most homologous to OM1 and FBP2, respectively. The OsMADS7 and 8 transcripts were detectable primarily in carpels and also weakly in anthers. During flower development, the OsMADS genes started to express at the young flower stage and the expression continued to the late stage of flower development. The OsMADS7 and 8 genes were mapped on the long arms of the chromosome 8 and 9, respectively. To study the functions of the genes, the cDNA clones were expressed ectopically using the CaMV 35S promoter in a heterologous tobacco plant system. Transgenic plants expressing the OsMADS genes exhibited the phenotype of early flowering and dwarfism. The strength of the phenotypes was proportional to the levels of transgene expression and the phenotypes were co-inherited with the kanamycin resistant gene to the next generation. These results indicate that OsMADS7 and 8 are structurally related to the AGL2 family and are involved in controlling flowering time.
7858231	Isolation and characterization of two beta-tubulin cDNA clones from rice.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Two cDNA clones encoding two different beta-tubulins, RTUB-1 and RTUB-2, were isolated from a rice cDNA library and their nucleotide sequences were analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequences showed amino acid sequence identity between 92% and 97% with other plant beta-tubulins. Southern blot analysis using gene-specific and coding-region probes suggested that beta-tubulins in rice are encoded by multigene families. The two cDNA clones represent two subfamilies of rice tubulins, RTUB-1 and RTUB-2, consisting of 3 to 4 genes and a single gene, respectively. The transcript levels of RTUB-1 and RTUB-2 genes were higher in actively elongating tissues such as etiolated shoot tissues and light-grown root tissues of four-day old seedlings.

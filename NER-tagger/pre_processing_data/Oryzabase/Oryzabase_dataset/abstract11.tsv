12615950	AtDUR3 encodes a new type of high-affinity urea/H+ symporter in Arabidopsis.	2003	Plant Cell	Urea is the major nitrogen form supplied as fertilizer in agricultural plant production but also an important nitrogen metabolite in plants. We report the cloning and functional characterization of AtDUR3, a high-affinity urea transporter in plants. AtDUR3 contains 14 putative transmembrane-spanning domains and represents an individual member in Arabidopsis that belongs to a superfamily of sodium-solute symporters. Heterologous expression in urea uptake-defective yeast as well as two-electrode voltage clamp and uptake studies using (14)C-labeled urea in AtDUR3-expressing oocytes demonstrated that AtDUR3 mediates urea transport. In both heterologous systems, urea transport was stimulated at low pH. In oocytes, inward currents indicated that urea is cotransported with protons. By contrast, a supply of Na(+) ions could not stimulate urea transport. Transport of (14)C-labeled urea by AtDUR3 in oocytes exhibited saturation kinetics with a K(m) of approximately 3 micro M. AtDUR3 was expressed in shoots and roots and upregulated during early germination and under nitrogen deficiency in roots. We propose a role of AtDUR3 in urea uptake by plant cells at low external urea concentrations.
7858235	Isolation and expression analysis of two rice genes encoding the major intrinsic protein.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated two rice cDNAs (rMip1 and rTip1) which are homologous to the genes encoding the major intrinsic protein (Mip) (soybean nod-26 and Arabidopsis gamma-Tip), respectively. Expression of rTip1 in shoots and roots of rice seedlings was enhanced by water stress, salt stress and exogenous ABA. rMip1 was expressed only in shoots. Although mRNA level of rMip1 in shoots was induced to a small extent by exogenous ABA, it did not show any increase under water or salt stress over the course of 12 h. On the basis of the differential expression patterns and evolutional distinctions, it is suggested that the possible channel proteins encoded by rMip1 and rTip1 genes may function in different transport systems.
14535884	Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity.	2003	Plant J	Casein kinases are critical in cell division and differentiation across species. A rice cDNA fragment encoding a putative casein kinase I (CKI) was identified via cDNA macroarray under brassinosteroid (BR) treatment, and a 1939-bp full-length cDNA, OsCKI1, was isolated and found to encode a putative 463-aa protein. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis indicated that OsCKI1 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues and upregulated by treatments with BR and abscisic acid (ABA). Enzymatic assay of recombinant OsCKI1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed that the protein was capable of phosphorylating casein. The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation. Treatment of wild-type plants with CKI-7, a specific inhibitor of CKI, also confirmed these functions of OsCKI1. Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels. Transgenic plants were less sensitive than control plants to ABA or BR treatment during germination, suggesting that OsCKI1 may be involved in various hormone-signaling pathways. OsCKI1-GFP fusion studies revealed the localization of OsCKI1 to the nucleus, suggesting a possible involvement in regulation of gene expression. In OsCKI1-deficient plants, differential gene expression was investigated using cDNA chip technology, and results indicated that genes related to signal transduction and hormone metabolism were indeed with altered expression.
12561471	[Analysis and mapping of homologous sequences of barley disease resistance gene Mlo and maize disease resistance gene Hm1 in rice].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	The encoding products of the disease resistance (R) gene of barley, Mlo, and the maize R gene, Hm1, do not contain the recognizable structural domains of most of the known plant R gene products. The two genes do not comply with the gene-for-gene theory in the response to pathogen infection either. Two sequences, OsMlo-1 and DFR-1 which were homologous to the barley Mlo and maize Hm1, respectively, were isolated from rice. The OsMlo-1 was mapped between two molecular markers, RZ667 and RG424, and located at a distance of 20.6 centi-Morgan (cM) from RZ667 and 6.0 cM from RG424 on rice chromosome 6. The DFR-1 was flanked by molecular markers R2635 and RG462 with an estimated genetic distance of 11.3 cM from R2635 and 23.9 cM from RG462 on rice chromosome 1. Using other published rice molecular linkage maps as references, it was found that the chromosomal locations of OsMlo-1 and DFR-1 were correspondence with two previously identified rice blast resistant QTLs (quantitative trait loci), respectively. The results suggest that the genes homologous to barley Mlo and maize Hm1 in rice may be involved in defense responses induced by pathogen infection.
10528264	OsMADS13, a novel rice MADS-box gene expressed during ovule development.	1999	Dev Genet	MADS-box genes have been shown to play a major role in defining plant architecture. Recently, several MADS-box genes have been reported that are highly expressed in the ovule. However, only for the Petunia genes FBP7 and FBP11 has a function in defining ovule identity been shown. We have isolated a rice MADS-box gene named OsMADS13. Expression analysis has shown that this gene is highly expressed in developing ovules. In order to facilitate a detailed characterization of rice ovule-expressed genes, a comprehensive morphological description of ovule development in rice has been performed. The predicted amino acid sequence of OsMADS13 shows significant homology with ZAG2, a maize MADS-box gene, which is also expressed mainly in the ovule. Mapping of the gene in the rice genome showed that it is located on chromosome 12, which is syntenic to two maize regions where ZAG2 and its paralogous gene ZMM1 have been mapped. Our results suggest that OsMADS13 is the ortholog of ZAG2 and ZMM1 and might play a role in rice ovule and seed development.
12172034	Three novel MYB proteins with one DNA binding repeat mediate sugar and hormone regulation of alpha-amylase gene expression.	2002	Plant Cell	The expression of alpha-amylase genes in cereals is induced by both gibberellin (GA) and sugar starvation. All alpha-amylase genes isolated from cereals contain a TATCCA element or its variants at positions approximately 90 to 150 bp upstream of the transcription start sites. The TATCCA element was shown previously to be an important component of the GA response complex and the sugar response complex of alpha-amylase gene promoters. In the present study, three cDNA clones encoding novel MYB proteins with single DNA binding domains were isolated from a rice suspension cell cDNA library and designated OsMYBS1, OsMYBS2, and OsMYBS3. Gel mobility shift experiments with OsMYBSs showed that they bind specifically to the TATCCA element in vitro. Yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 bind to the TATCCA element and transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element in vivo. Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation. Transient expression assays also showed that these three OsMYBSs cooperate with a GA-regulated transcription factor, HvMYBGa, in the transactivation of a low-pI barley alpha-amylase gene promoter in the absence of GA. Two-hybrid experiments with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 is able to form a homodimer. The present study demonstrates that differential DNA binding affinity, promoter transactivation ability, dimerization, and interactions with other protein factors determine the biological function of OsMYBSs. This study also suggests that common transcription factors are involved in the sugar and hormonal regulation of alpha-amylase gene expression in cereals.
15683393	Detecting active methanogenic populations on rice roots using stable isotope probing.	2005	Environ Microbiol	Methane is formed on rice roots mainly by CO2 reduction. The present study aimed to identify the active methanogenic populations responsible for this process. Soil-free rice roots were incubated anaerobically under an atmosphere of H2/(13CO2) or N2/(13CO2) with phosphate or carbonate (marble) as buffer medium. Nucleic acids were extracted and fractionated by caesium trifluoroacetate equilibrium density gradient centrifugation after 16-day incubation. Community analyses were performed for gradient fractions using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. In addition, rRNA was extracted and analysed at different time points to trace the community change during the 16-day incubation. The Methanosarcinaceae and the yet-uncultured archaeal lineage Rice Cluster-I (RC-I) were predominant in the root incubations when carbonate buffer and N2 headspace were used. The analysis of [13C]DNA showed that the relative 16S rRNA gene abundance of RC-I increased whereas that of the Methanosarcinaceae decreased with increasing DNA buoyant density, indicating that members of RC-I were more active than the Methanosarcinaceae. However, an unexpected finding was that RC-I was suppressed in the presence of high H2 concentrations (80%, v/v), which during the early incubation period caused a lower CH4 production compared with that with N2 in the headspace. Eventually, however, CH4 production increased, probably because of the activity of Methanosarcinaceae, which became prevalent. Phosphate buffer appeared to inhibit the activity of the Methanosarcinaceae, resulting in lower CH4 production as compared with carbonate buffer. Under these conditions, Methanobacteriaceae were the prevalent methanogens. Our study suggests that the active methanogenic populations on rice roots change in correspondence to the presence of H2 (80%, v/v) and the type of buffer used in the system.
15685422	Purification and characterization of two ascorbate peroxidases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) expressed in Escherichia coli.	2005	Biotechnol Lett	To clarify the diversity and function of isozymes of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in plants, a method of producing large quantities of these proteins is needed. Here, we describe an Escherichia coli expression system for the rapid and economic expression of two rice APX genes, APXa and APXb (GeneBank accession Nos. D45423 and AB053297, respectively). The two genes were cloned into the pGEX-6p-3 vector to allow expression of APX as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The GST-APXa and GST-APXb fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, with final yields of 40 and 73 mg g(-1) dry cells, respectively. Specific activities were 15 and 20 mM ascorbate min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. The K(m) values for ascorbate were 4 and 1 mM, respectively, and those for H(2)O(2) were 0.3 and 0.7 mM, respectively indicating that the two rice isoenzymes have different properties.
2649869	Nucleotide sequences of two genes encoding the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein of rice.	1989	Nucleic Acids Res	
1392604	A rice cab gene promoter contains separate cis-acting elements that regulate expression in dicot and monocot plants.	1992	Plant Cell	The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus are encoded by families of nuclear cab genes. The expression of most cab genes is tissue specific and photoregulated in angiosperms. In transgenic tobacco plants, expression of the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) is photoregulated and tissue specific from 5' upstream sequences of the rice cab1R gene; deletion of sequences upstream from position -170 with respect to the transcription start site eliminates the enhanced and photoregulated expression in the transgenic plants. Using an in situ transient expression assay, we have determined that the sequence OCT-R, an octamer repeat that lies within the -269 to -170 region of cab1R, is essential for photoregulated expression of the chimeric GUS gene in leaf cells of maize and rice but is not required for expression in illuminated tobacco leaves. Conversely, box III*- and G-box-like sequences found near OCT-R in cab1R are necessary for high-level transient expression of the reporter gene in tobacco leaf tissue but are not required for transient expression in maize or rice leaves.
11264415	Molecular evolution of the teosinte branched gene among maize and related grasses.	2001	Mol Biol Evol	Several authors have proposed that changes in a small number of regulatory genes may be sufficient for the evolution of novel morphologies. Recent analyses have indicated that teosinte branched1 (tb1), a putative bHLH transcription factor, played such a role during the morphological evolution of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte. To address whether or not tb1 played a similar role during the evolution of the Andropogoneae, the tribe to which maize belongs, and to examine the rate and pattern of tb1 evolution within this tribe, we analyzed tb1-like sequences from 23 members of the Andropogoneae and five other grasses. Our analysis revealed that the TB1 protein evolves slowly within three conserved domains but rapidly outside these domains. The nonconserved regions of the gene are characterized by both a high nonsynonymous substitution rate and frequent indels. The ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (d(N)) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (d(S)) was not significantly greater than 1.0, providing no evidence for positive selection. However, the d(N)/d(S) ratio varied significantly among lineages and was high compared with those of other plant nuclear genes. Variation in the d(N)/d(S) ratio among the Andropogoneae could be explained by unequal levels of purifying selection among lineages. Consistent with this interpretation, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution differed along several lineages, while the synonymous substitution rate did not differ significantly. Finally, using tb1, we examined phylogenetic relationships within the Andropogoneae. The phylogeny suggests that the tribe underwent a rapid radiation during its early history and that the monoecious Andropogoneae are polyphyletic.
16163610	Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses.	2005	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	In the present study, we cloned and identified a full-length cDNA of a rice gene, OsBIHD1, encoding a homeodomain type transcriptional factor. OsBIHD1 is predicted to encode a 642 amino acid protein and the deduced protein sequence of OsBIHD1 contains all conserved domains, a homeodomain, a BELL domain, a SKY box, and a VSLTLGL box, which are characteristics of the BELL type homedomain proteins. The recombinant OsBIHD1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli bound to the TGTCA motif that is the characteristic cis-element DNA sequence of the homeodomain transcriptional factors. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the OsBIHD1 protein localized in the nucleus of the plant cells. The OsBIHD1 gene was mapped to chromosome 3 of the rice genome and is a single-copy gene with four exons and three introns. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of OsBIHD1 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance. Expression of OsBIHD1 was also up-regulated rapidly during the first 6 h after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during the incompatible interaction between M. grisea and a resistant genotype. These results suggest that OsBIHD1 is a BELL type of homeodomain transcription factor present in the nucleus, whose induction is associated with resistance response in rice.

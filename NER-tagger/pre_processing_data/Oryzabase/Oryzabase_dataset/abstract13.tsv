1597177	cDNA cloning of rice lipoxygenase L-2 and characterization using an active enzyme expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli.	1992	Eur J Biochem	A full-length cDNA of rice lipoxygenase L-2 was cloned from 3-day-old seedlings. The identity of the clone was determined by amino acid sequencing of selected peptides of the purified enzyme and immunological characterization of an active enzyme that was produced from the cDNA in Escherichia coli by cultivation at 15 degrees C. The nucleotide sequence showed a strong bias toward G and C in the selection of nucleotides, especially at the third position of the codons (93% G/C). The complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated to be 96,657 Da based on 865 amino acids. The amino acid sequence shares similarity with those of dicot lipoxygenases throughout the enzyme at a level of 50%. A hydropathy profile calculated from the amino acid sequence resembled those of dicot lipoxygenases, suggesting conservation of the secondary structure of these enzymes. The active enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli, was characterized for pH dependence of the enzyme activity, intramolecular specificity, heat stability and Km. The enzyme had the same properties as the L-2 enzyme that was isolated from seedlings, but differed from the lipoxygenase L-3 isolated from mature plants.
11487705	Repression domains of class II ERF transcriptional repressors share an essential motif for active repression.	2001	Plant Cell	We reported previously that three ERF transcription factors, tobacco ERF3 (NtERF3) and Arabidopsis AtERF3 and AtERF4, which are categorized as class II ERFs, are active repressors of transcription. To clarify the roles of these repressors in transcriptional regulation in plants, we attempted to identify the functional domains of the ERF repressor that mediates the repression of transcription. Analysis of the results of a series of deletions revealed that the C-terminal 35 amino acids of NtERF3 are sufficient to confer the capacity for repression of transcription on a heterologous DNA binding domain. This repression domain suppressed the intermolecular activities of other transcriptional activators. In addition, fusion of this repression domain to the VP16 activation domain completely inhibited the transactivation function of VP16. Comparison of amino acid sequences of class II ERF repressors revealed the conservation of the sequence motif (L)/(F)DLN(L)/(F)(x)P. This motif was essential for repression because mutations within the motif eliminated the capacity for repression. We designated this motif the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, and we identified this motif in a number of zinc-finger proteins from wheat, Arabidopsis, and petunia plants. These zinc finger proteins functioned as repressors, and their repression domains were identified as regions that contained an EAR motif.
11250078	Characterization and expression of the genes for cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb (COX6b) from rice and Arabidopsis thaliana.	2001	Gene	Many of the subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondria of higher plants are encoded by nuclear genes. These genes are less characterized compared to mitochondrial-encoded genes. We previously isolated a cDNA encoding COX6b (designated OsCOX6b1 in this study) from the rice nuclear genome and analyzed its expression. The deduced protein had an extended N-terminus compared with human and yeast COX6b proteins. In this study, we identified another COX6b gene (OsCOX6b2) in rice and revealed that it was actually expressed. The deduced protein of this gene did not have an extended N-terminus and had about the same size as the human and yeast proteins. Genomic Southern hybridization analysis revealed that there was at least one OsCOX6b-homologus sequences in the rice genome other than OsCOX6b1 and OsCOX6b2. Furthermore, we identified three COX6b genes in a dicotyledonous plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. One of these genes (AtCOX6b1) was relatively long, with a length similar to that of OsCOX6b1, and the other two (AtCOX6b2 and AtCOX6b3) were shorter, with lengths similar to the length of OsCOX6b2. Genomic Southern hybridization analysis indicated there were no additional COX6b genes in the Arabidopsis genome. The coding regions of OsCOX6b1 and AtCOX6b1 were separated by four introns and those of OsCOX6b2, AtCOX6b2 and AtCOX6b3 were separated by three introns. A Northern hybridization analysis showed that OsCOX6b1, AtCOX6b1 and AtCOX6b3 were expressed in all organs examined, although with some differences in the amount of expression among the organs. OsCOX6b2 and AtCOX6b2 were strongly expressed in roots but most of the transcripts of AtCOX6b2 were degraded. The evolution of COX6b genes from rice and Arabidopsis is discussed.
16208489	Anaconda, a new class of transposon belonging to the Mu superfamily, has diversified by acquiring host genes during rice evolution.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	A new type of transposon, named Anaconda (Anac) has been found in rice (Oryza sativa). In this paper, we demonstrate that Anaconda elements have diversified by acquisition of host cellular genes, amplification of the elements, and substitution and deletion of short segments. We identified four Anaconda elements in studies of rice alternative oxidase (AOX) genes, and subsequently isolated an additional 23 elements based on the identity of their terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). The Anaconda elements have long TIRs (114-458 bp). They also have direct repeats of 9 or 10 bp in their flanking regions that are thought to have been generated upon transposition. These structural features reveal that the Anaconda elements belong to the Mu superfamily. The most prominent feature of the Anaconda elements is the high frequency with which they have acquired host cellular genes. Of the 27 elements found here, 19 appear to have sequences presumably derived from rice genes, for example, the genes for AOX1c (four elements), cytochrome P450 (five elements), L: -asparaginase (five elements), and PCF8 (two elements). Four elements, AnacA1-A4, have both the AOX1c and P450 genes. One element, AnacB14, involves a gene similar to mudrA of maize MuDR. Database analyses revealed that the loci of 26 of the 27 Anaconda elements in the subspecies japonica are the same as those in the subspecies indica. This suggests that these elements were incorporated before the divergence of these two subspecies.
10586517	RIRE2, a novel gypsy-type retrotransposon from rice.	1999	Genes Genet Syst	The 441-bp DNA segment in a PCR-amplified fragment from Oryza sativa cv. IR36 was found to have a sequence with features characteristic of LTRs of retroelements, which was named RIRE2 (Rice retroelement #2) and further analyzed. Cloning and sequencing analyses of the DNA segments connected to LTR-like sequence showed that RIRE2 has a long internal region almost 10 kb long that is flanked by LTR-like sequences. This internal region carries a primer binding site (PBS) and polypurine tract (PPT) which are necessary for cDNA synthesis of retroelements. The PBS sequence is complementary to the 3' end region of tRNA(Arg). The internal region has an rt gene homologous to that of gypsy-type retrotransposons, evidence that RIRE2 is indeed a retrotransposon related to gypsy from Drosophila. RIRE2 has an extra sequence more than 4 kb long in the region downstream of gag-pol. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative amino-acid sequences of the rt gene as well as the int gene showed that RIRE2 is related to a group of gypsy-type retrotransposons of a large size that include Grande1-4 of teosinte, Tat4-1 and Athila1-1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, and Cyclops-2 of pea, but distantly related to any other group of gypsy-type retrotransposons, including RIRE3 and RIRE8 of rice. RIRE2 and Grande1-4 had the highest homology in the gag-pol region, but the nucleotide sequences of the LTR regions differed. Both elements had significant homology in the middle area of the extra regions downstream of gag-pol, in which they had an open reading frame encoding a protein with no known function on the opposite strand from that coding for gag-pol.
15969500	Molecular cloning and characterization of oryzacystatin-III, a novel member of phytocystatin in rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica).	2005	J Agric Food Chem	On the basis of cDNA sequences, we found that the calli of rice encodes an amino acid sequence that shares 56% and 89% identity, respectively, with oryzacystatin-I and oryzacystatin-II. This sequence differs from that of oryzacystatin-II in the N-terminal region (Gln(7)-Ala(19) in the oryzacystatin-III numbering), and this region contained a glycine residue (Gly(14)), which is evolutionarily conserved in the cystatin superfamily. We named this novel protein oryzacystatin-III. Nucleotide sequencing of the 5'-flanking region of the oryzacystatin-III gene showed that it is highly homologous to the oryzacystatin-II gene but distinct from the oryzacystatin-II locus. Oryzacystatin-III inhibited papain, ficin, and human cathepsin B. The inhibition constants for papain and ficin differ from those of oryzacystatin-I and -II, and cathepsin B activity is affected only by oryzacystatin-III, showing differences in the interaction of these inhibitors with enzymes. These data suggest that the above three inhibitors may play unique physiological roles in the regulations of rice cysteine proteinases.
1377969	Nucleotide sequence of a long cDNA from the rice waxy gene.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	
2745459	Structure and expression of the rice glutelin multigene family.	1989	J Biol Chem	A near full-length cDNA and three genomic clones for rice (Oryza sativa L.) glutelin were isolated and studied. Based on nucleic acid sequence and Southern blot analyses, the three isolated glutelin genomic clones were representative members of three gene subfamilies each containing five to eight copies. A comparison of DNA sequences displayed by relevant regions of these genomic clones showed that two subfamilies, represented by clones Gt1 and Gt2, were closely related and evolved by more recent gene duplication events. The 5'-flanking and coding sequences of Gt1 and Gt2 displayed at least 87% homology. In contrast, Gt3 showed little or no homology in the 5'-flanking sequences upstream of the putative CAAT boxes and exhibited significant divergence in all other portions of the gene. Conserved sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of these genes were identified and discussed in light of their potential regulatory role. The derived primary sequences of all three glutelin genomic clones showed significant homology to the legume 11 S storage proteins indicating a common gene origin. A comparison of the derived glutelin primary sequences showed that mutations were clustered in three peptide regions. One peptide region corresponded to the highly mutable hypervariable region of legume 11 S storage proteins, a potential target area for protein modification. Expression studies indicated that glutelin mRNA transcripts are differentially accumulated during endosperm development. Promoters of Gt2 and Gt3 were functional as they direct transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in cultured plant cells.
12040100	Isolation and characterization of a putative transducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress in Oryza sativa.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	Following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that prevents correct folding or assembly of ER proteins, at least three responses occur to maintain cell homeostasis: induction of chaperones, attenuation of protein synthesis, and enhancement of lipid synthesis. Transducers that transmit ER stress to the nucleus have already been identified in yeast and mammals. We report here isolation of a cDNA, OsIre1, from rice encoding a putative homolog of Ire1p, a yeast transducer of ER stress. OsIre1 encodes a polypeptide consisting of 893 amino acids, in which two hydrophobic stretches are present in the amino-terminal (N-terminal) and middle regions, possibly serving as a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain was found to possess serine/threonine protein kinase and ribonuclease-like domains showing high similarities with regions in Ire1 homologs from other organisms. A fusion protein of OsIre1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in tobacco BY2 cells could be demonstrated to localize to the ER and the N-terminal domain of OsIre1 could substitute for yeast Ire1p in yeast cells. When produced in bacteria as a fusion protein, the C-terminal region of OsIre1 showed autophosphorylation activity. These results thus indicate that OsIre1 encodes a putative plant transducer of ER stress.
12399401	Molecular evidence on the origin and evolution of glutinous rice.	2002	Genetics	Glutinous rice is a major type of cultivated rice with long-standing cultural importance in Asia. A mutation in an intron 1 splice donor site of the Waxy gene is responsible for the change in endosperm starch leading to the glutinous phenotype. Here we examine an allele genealogy of the Waxy locus to trace the evolutionary and geographical origins of this phenotype. On the basis of 105 glutinous and nonglutinous landraces from across Asia, we find evidence that the splice donor mutation has a single evolutionary origin and that it probably arose in Southeast Asia. Nucleotide diversity measures indicate that the origin of glutinous rice is associated with reduced genetic variation characteristic of selection at the Waxy locus; comparison with an unlinked locus, RGRC2, confirms that this pattern is specific to Waxy. In addition, we find that many nonglutinous varieties in Northeast Asia also carry the splice donor site mutation, suggesting that partial suppression of this mutation may have played an important role in the development of Northeast Asian nonglutinous rice. This study demonstrates the utility of phylogeographic approaches for understanding trait diversification in crops, and it contributes to growing evidence on the importance of modifier loci in the evolution of domestication traits.
16164597	PHYTOCLOCK 1 encoding a novel GARP protein essential for the Arabidopsis circadian clock.	2005	Genes Cells	Previously, we screened 50 000 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana carrying a P(GI)::LUC+ bioluminescence reporter gene mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate for mutants with phenotypes of extensively altered circadian rhythms, and identified three loci, PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL1), PCL2 and PCL3, whose mutations cause arrhythmia. Here we succeeded to clone the PCL1 gene and show that the PCL1 gene encodes a novel DNA binding protein belonging to the GARP protein family and is essential for a functional clock oscillator in A. thaliana. The PCL1 gene satisfies the requirements for the clock oscillator gene: (i) pcl1 null mutations caused arrhythmia in multiple circadian outputs, including expression of potential clock genes TOC1, CCA1 and LHY, and flowering lacked a photoperiodic response; (ii) PCL1 expression showed circadian rhythm in both constant light and constant dark; (iii) over-expression of the PCL1 gene gradually caused arrhythmicity in all the multiple circadian outputs examined; and (iv) the PCL1 gene controlled its own expression via negative feedback. Therefore, the PCL1 gene is the clock oscillator gene essential to the generation of clock oscillation in the higher plant.
11133985	A rice functional transcriptional activator, RISBZ1, responsible for endosperm-specific expression of storage protein genes through GCN4 motif.	2001	J Biol Chem	The GCN4 motif, a cis-element that is highly conserved in the promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, plays a central role in controlling endosperm-specific expression. This motif is the recognition site for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to the group of maize Opaque-2 (O2)-like proteins. Five different basic leucine zipper cDNA clones, designated RISBZ1-5, have been isolated from a rice seed cDNA library. The predicted gene products can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences. Although all the RISBZ proteins are able to interact with the GCN4 motif, only RISBZ1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter fused to a pentamer of the GCN4 motif. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain revealed that the proline-rich N-terminal domain (27 amino acids in length) is responsible for transactivation. The RISBZ1 protein is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other RISBZ subunit proteins. RISBZ1 gene expression is restricted to the seed, where it precedes the expression of storage protein genes. When the RISBZ1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and the chimeric gene was introduced into rice, the beta-glucuronidase gene is specifically expressed in aleurone and subaleurone layer of the developing endosperm. These findings suggest that the specific expression of transcriptional activator RISBZ1 gene may determine the endosperm specificity of the storage protein genes.
7697296	Identification and characterization of a family of genes for the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase of Oryza sativa L.	1994	Plant Cell Physiol	A cDNA clone (cOSA2) encoding a plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase was isolated from rice. Southern blot analysis indicated that the genes that corresponds to cOSA2 was different from that to cOSA1. Northern blots revealed OSA2 mRNA in roots, calli and shoots. OSA1 transcripts were detected only by RT-PCR in these tissues.
15388982	Diterpene cyclases responsible for the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, momilactones A, B, and oryzalexins A-F in rice.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces diterpene phytoalexins, such as momilactones, oryzalexins, and phytocassanes. Using rice genome information and in vitro assay with recombinant enzymes, we identified genes (OsKS4 and OsKS10) encoding the type-A diterpene cyclases 9beta-pimara-7,15-diene synthase and ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase which are involved in the biosynthesis of momilactones A, B and oryzalexins A-F respectively. Transcript levels of these two genes increased remarkably after ultraviolet (UV) treatment, which is consistent with elevated production of phytoalexins by UV. These two genes might prove powerful tools for understanding plant defense mechanisms in rice.
15341631	Biological functions of ent- and syn-copalyl diphosphate synthases in rice: key enzymes for the branch point of gibberellin and phytoalexin biosynthesis.	2004	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) and syn-CDP as precursors for several classes of phytoalexins and the phytohormones, gibberellins (GAs). It has recently been shown that a loss-of-function mutation of OsCPS1, a gene encoding a putative ent-CDP synthase, results in a severely GA-deficient dwarf phenotype in rice. To clarify the biological functions of the ent- and syn-CDP synthases involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins and/or GAs, we isolated two cDNAs, OsCyc1 and OsCyc2, encoding putative diterpene cyclases from ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare). The production of phytoalexins in rice leaves is known to be highly induced by UV treatment. Using a bacterial expression system, we demonstrated that OsCyc1 encodes syn-CDP synthase and that OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 encode ent-CDP synthase. The level of expression of the OsCyc1 and OsCyc2 transcripts in rice leaves increased drastically in response to UV treatment, whereas expression of the OsCPS1 transcript was not induced by UV light. These results suggest that OsCyc1, OsCyc2 and OsCPS1 are responsible for the biosynthesis of momilactones A and B and oryzalexin S, oryzalexins A-F and phytocassanes A-E, and GAs, respectively. Our results strongly suggest the presence of two ent-CDP synthase isoforms in rice, one that participates in the biosynthesis of GAs and a second that is involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins.
12242506	Characterization of transposable elements in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using Representational Difference Analysis (RDA).	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	Representational Difference Analysis was applied to characterize genomic differentiations between rice ( Oryza sativa) and foxtail millet ( Setaria italica) and subsequently to identify rice transposable elements. Rice was used as the tester and millet as the driver. A total of eleven, non-redundant, positive clones were isolated from the library. Their analysis revealed that they all represent dispersed repetitive DNA sequences. In addition, homology searches using the BLAST procedure showed that they correspond to seven distinct rice transposable elements. Three had been previously identified as gypsy-like retroelements ( Retrosat1, RIRE3 and RIRE8). The remaining four are novel: we named them hipa (a CACTA-like transposon), houba (a copia-like retroelement), hopi and dagul (two gypsy-like retroelements). The RDA clones were used as probes in Southern hybridization experiments with genomic DNAs of several species from the family Poaceae. The results suggest that the genomic differentiations associated with the activity of these transposable elements are of relatively recent origin. In addition, comparison of the hybridization patterns obtained for several Oryza species suggests that several independent amplifications of these transposable elements might have occurred within the genus.
12569425	Molecular phylogeny and evolution of the plant-specific seven-transmembrane MLO family.	2003	J Mol Evol	Homologues of barley Mlo encode the only family of seven-transmembrane (TM) proteins in plants. Their topology, subcellular localization, and sequence diversification are reminiscent of those of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) from animals and fungi. We present a computational analysis of MLO family members based on 31 full-size and 3 partial sequences, which originate from several monocot species, the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, and the moss Ceratodon purpureus. This enabled us to date the origin of the Mlo gene family back at least to the early stages of land plant evolution. The genomic organization of the corresponding genes supports a monophyletic origin of the Mlo gene family. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five clades, of which three contain both monocot and dicot members, while two indicate class-specific diversification. Analysis of the ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous changes in coding sequences provided evidence for functional constraint on the evolution of the DNA sequences and purifying selection, which appears to be reduced in the first extracellular loop of 12 closely related orthologues. The 31 full-size sequences were examined for potential domain-specific intramolecular coevolution. This revealed evidence for concerted evolution of all three cytoplasmic domains with each other and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, suggesting interplay of all intracellular domains for MLO function.
11911477	Purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of rice class III chitinase.	2002	Mol Cells	Several chitinases were expressed in a rice cell suspension culture and detected in the medium. One of them, designated as RCB4, was isolated 248 fold from the culture filtrate to homogeneity by 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose, Sephadex G-75 column chromatography, and native gel slicing. RCB4 had a molecular mass of 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The optimum temperature was 40 degrees C, and 96% of its activity still remained at 60 degrees C. The optimum pH was 4, and 95% of its activity was maintained at pH 2. Using a substrate (GlcNAc)6, the Km and Vmax values of RCB4 were 0.53 mM and 11.1 mM/min, respectively. The N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of RCB4 were determined to be VNSNLFRDYIGA and MALWA, respectively. A cDNA (C12523) clone that contained the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of RCB4 was obtained, sequenced, and renamed RCB41. RCB41 encoded 307 amino acid protein with a signal peptide of 25 amino acids and showed a 45% similarity to gladiolus chitinase GBC-a, one of the class III chitinase family. The expression of RCB4l in E. coli showed that RCB41 encodes a chitinase.
15232225	Further evidence of microcolinearity between barley and rice genomes at two orthologous regions.	2004	Mol Cells	Two genetic markers, BCD135 and RZ567 were used to select clones from genomic BAC libraries of barley and rice for sequencing and subsequent sequence comparisons. A set of two orthologous BACs each from barley and rice was selected by hybridization with BCD135 and RZ567 cDNA probes. A total of 556-kb stretch including two barley BACs (773K135 and 745C13) and two orthologous rice BACs (24K23 and 49D11) was completely sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis between orthologous BACs from the two species revealed presence of two conserved genes at BCD135 region and only one gene at the RZ567 regions. The two conserved genes were in the same order and orientation in both the species however, separated by significantly larger distance in barley. The larger distance between two barley genes was mainly due to presence of different retrotransposable elements and their derivatives (78.9% of the intergenic region) that expanded the barley BCD135 region at the rate of 9.1X. An additional gene of unknown function was also inserted along with several retrotransposable elements between two conserved genes at barley BCD135 region. More genome expansion rate (10X) around barley RZ567 locus was estimated by extremely high proportion (> 70%) of retrotransposons. Among different retrotransposons, the Sabrina elements rather than BARE were more prevalent in both the regions. Contrary to it, the BCD135 region of rice was composed of only 17.1% retrotransposable elements and no significant retrotransposons except 14 miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs) were observed in its RZ567 region. The sequence comparison between orthologous regions of rice and barley genomes was useful for gene identification and determination of individual gene structure indicating the possibility of effective utilization of rice genome sequences in understanding the large genome of barley. (The sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank data library under the accession no. AF474072 (773K14), AF474071 (745C13), AF480497 (24K23) and AF480496 (49D11)).
12271140	Rice phosphate transporters include an evolutionarily divergent gene specifically activated in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Using a genome-wide approach, we asked how many transporter genes contribute to symbiotic phosphate uptake and analyzed their evolutionary conservation. Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene OsPT11 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. This induction was confined to the root system and was tightly correlated with the degree of root colonization by Glomus intraradices. OsPT11 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere. Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate OsPT11, corroborating the high signal specificity for OsPT11 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. OsPT11 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function. Recently, a phosphate transporter gene in potato was shown to be induced during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Assessment of the phylogenetic relationship of the rice and potato protein revealed that the rice is nonorthologous to the potato protein. Further, there are no structural commonalities in the promoter regions. Thus, although cytological and physiological features of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis seem to be conserved, the molecular components may differ significantly between distantly related plant species.
15233790	A new rice zinc-finger protein binds to the O2S box of the alpha-amylase gene promoter.	2004	Eur J Biochem	A putative transcription factor, named RAMY, that binds to the 20-bp O2S sequences of the regulatory region of the Amy2 gene promoter has been identified using the yeast one-hybrid system from a rice library. The full length RAMY cDNA clone encodes a 218-amino acid protein and is homologous to the late embryogenesis-abundant protein (LEA5). In vitro mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that RAMY can bind with O2S specifically through an unusual zinc finger with a CXCX(4)CX(2)H consensus sequence. Low levels of RAMY mRNAs were detected in rice leaves and roots by Northern blot hybridization. The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) induces expression of both RAMY and Amy2 genes, as performed by Northern blot hybridization, but the increase in RAMY mRNA level occurs prior to that of the Amy2 mRNA level in the GA-treated aleurone tissues. These data suggest that RAMY may act as a trans-acting protein and is probably involved in the GA-induced expression of the rice alpha-amylase gene.
7508918	A novel lipoxygenase from rice. Primary structure and specific expression upon incompatible infection with rice blast fungus.	1994	J Biol Chem	A novel lipoxygenase cDNA (3,007 base pairs) was isolated from rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Aichiasahi) which had been infected with an incompatible race of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. A single copy of the gene is present in the rice genome and encodes a protein of 923 residues with a molecular weight of 102,714. This gene product shares the least amino acid sequence homology among plant lipoxygenases identified to date. A novel feature of this gene product is a putative transit peptide sequence at the amino terminus, suggesting the enzyme is localized in chloroplasts. An active lipoxygenase was expressed from the cDNA in Escherichia coli and characterized. The lipoxygenase introduces molecular oxygen exclusively into the C-13 position of linoleic and linolenic acids. The gene is expressed at high levels 15 h after inoculation with an incompatible race of M. grisea, at a low level after inoculation with a compatible race of the pathogen, and is not expressed in mock-infected leaves. Gene expression begins at the same time that the pathogen begins to penetrate into leaf tissue. This novel lipoxygenase gene expression is a part of the early response of the host to pathogenic attack.
7493934	A rice HAL2-like gene encodes a Ca(2+)-sensitive 3'(2'),5'-diphosphonucleoside 3'(2')-phosphohydrolase and complements yeast met22 and Escherichia coli cysQ mutations.	1995	J Biol Chem	A plant homolog of yeast HAL2 gene (RHL) was cloned from rice (Orizya sativa L.). The RHL cDNA complemented an Escherichia coli cysteine auxotrophic mutant, cysQ, and the yeast HAL2 mutant, met22. The latter is a methionine auxotroph and cannot use sulfate, sulfite, or sulfide as sulfur sources but exhibits wild-type activities of the enzymes necessary to assimilate sulfate and has normal sulfur uptake system. These results demonstrated that HAL2, cysQ, and RHL genes encode proteins with similar function in sulfur assimilatory pathway. The RHL cDNA expressed a 40-kDa protein that was shown to catalyze the conversion of adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3'(2')-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) to AMP. The enzyme activity is Mg(2+)-dependent, sensitive to Ca2+, Li+, and Na+ and activated by K+. The inhibition by Ca2+ depends on the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio and is reversible by high Mg2+ concentration. The substrate specificity and kinetics of RHL enzyme are very similar to the Chlorella 3'(2'),5'-diphosphonucleoside 3'(2')-phosphohydrolase (DPNPase). Our evidence suggests that this enzyme regulates the flux of sulfur in the sulfur-activation pathway by converting PAPS to APS. Several residues that are essential for the activity of this enzyme were identified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the possible role of DPNPase in salt tolerance is discussed.
3026911	A simple and rapid nucleotide sequencing strategy and its application in analyzing a rice histone 3 gene.	1986	Gene	An improved rapid method for sequencing a target DNA is described. A new plasmid, pAA-PZ1, which contains the origin of replication from phage M13 and a portion of the Tn9 transposon was constructed. A long fragment of target DNA cloned into this vector is progressively shortened in vivo from one end by transposon-mediated deletions. The plasmids carrying different lengths of target DNA are then made into single-stranded DNA in the same host upon infection with an M13 phage and their sequence is determined using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method. This method bypasses the in vitro enzymatic manipulations for progressive deletions and requires no subcloning. Using this strategy, we sequenced 1.3 kb of rice DNA containing a histone 3 gene within three weeks.
10080693	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	For identification of genes involved in embryogenesis in the model cereal rice, we have constructed a collection of cDNA libraries of well-defined stages of embryo development before, during and after organ differentiation. Here, we focus on the possible role of KNOX (maize Knotted1-like) class homeobox genes in regulation of rice embryogenesis. Three types of KNOX clones were identified in libraries of early zygotic embryos. Two of these, Oskn2 and Oskn3, encode newly described KNOX genes, whereas the third (Oskn1) corresponds to the previously described OSH1 gene. In situ hybridizations showed that during the early stages of embryo development, all three KNOX genes are expressed in the region where the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is organizing, suggesting that these genes are involved in regulating SAM formation. Whereas OSH1 was previously proposed to function also in SAM maintenance, Oskn3 may be involved in patterning organ positions, as its expression was found to mark the boundaries of different embryonic organs following SAM formation. The expression pattern of Oskn2 suggested an additional role in scutellum and epiblast development. Transgenic expression of Oskn2 and Oskn3 in tobacco further supported their involvement in cell fate determination, like previously reported for Knotted1 and OSH1 ectopic expression. Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology. The observation that the KNOX genes produce similar though distinct phenotypic reponses in tobacco, indicates that their gene products act on overlapping but different sets of target genes, or that cell-type specific factors determine their precise action.
12676326	Mechanism underlying regulated expression of RFL, a conserved transcription factor, in the developing rice inflorescence.	2003	Mech Dev	LFY and its orthologues are necessary for flower specification in diverse dicotyledonous plants. The spatial and temporal RNA expression pattern of a rice LFY-like gene: RFL differs significantly from that in several other species studied thus far. The onset of RFL expression coincides with inflorescence meristem (panicle meristem) initiation, and continues during panicle branching. Notably, incipient flower primordia have lower expression levels, and during floral organogenesis the expression is restricted to second-whorl lodicules. To explore mechanisms underlying this distinct expression pattern, we have tested the transcription regulatory functions of sequences upstream to RFL coding sequences either alone, or together with intragenic segments. Sequences 3.0 kb upstream of the RFL reading frame do not confer correctly regulated reporter gene expression in transgenic rice. In contrast, RFL intron1 or 2 can individually confer the expected profile in the developing panicle and floret. However, the additional repression of expression in vegetative tissues, is a pattern achieved by intron2 together with far-upstream sequences. Strikingly, RFL intron2 sequences can even utilize the Arabidopsis thaliana LFY promoter to confer regulated transcription in young rice panicles. By sequence comparison of RFL upstream sequences, intron1, intron2 and the Arabidopsis LFY promoter, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements unique to RFL. These data exemplify the use of regulatory circuits specific to rice RFL that may underlie its divergent function.
1620614	Type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins depurinate plant 25S rRNA without species specificity.	1992	Nucleic Acids Res	Four different type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) with RNA N-glycosidase activity were tested for their ability to attack the large rRNA of plant ribosomes derived from tobacco plants, as well as from the plant species from which the particular RIP had been isolated. Incubation of tobacco ribosomes with RIPs isolated from either Phytolacca americana L. (pokeweed), Dianthus barbatus L. (carnation), Spinacia oleracea L. (spinach) or Chenopodium amaranthicolor Coste and Reyn. (chenopodium) rendered the 25S rRNA sensitive to aniline-catalyzed hydrolysis, generating a single rRNA-fragment of about 350 nucleotides. The same fragment was generated when rRNAs from pokeweed, carnation, spinach or chenopodium ribosomes were aniline-treated without any deliberate treatment of the ribosomes with the respective RIP. This indicated that ribosomes from all RIP-producing plants were already inactivated by their own RIPs during preparation. These results demonstrate that plant ribosomes are generally susceptible to RIP attack, including modification by their own RIPs. Direct sequencing of the newly generated fragments revealed that a single N-glycosidic bond at an adenosine residue within the highly conserved sequence 5'-AGUACGAGAGGA-3' was cleaved by all of the RIPs investigated, a situation also found in animal, yeast and Escherichia coli ribosomes.
15542489	Rice contains two disparate ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases with distinct metabolic functions.	2004	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces ent-copalyl diphosphate for both gibberellin (GA) phytohormone and defensive phytoalexin biosynthesis, raising the question of how this initial biosynthetic step is carried out for these distinct metabolic processes. Here, a functional genomics approach has been utilized to identify two disparate ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases from rice (OsCPS1ent and OsCPS2ent). Notably, it was very recently demonstrated that only one of these (OsCPS1ent) normally operates in GA biosynthesis as mutations in this gene result in severely impaired growth. Evidence is presented here strongly indicating that the other (OsCPS2ent) is involved in related secondary metabolism producing defensive phytochemicals. In particular, under appropriate conditions, OsCPS2ent mRNA is specifically induced in leaves prior to production of the corresponding phytoalexins. Thus, transcriptional control of OsCPS2ent seems to be an important means of regulating defensive phytochemical biosynthesis. Finally, OsCPS1ent is significantly more similar to the likewise GA-specific gene An1/ZmCPS1ent in maize (Zea mays) than its class II terpene synthase paralogs involved in rice secondary metabolism. Hence, we speculate that this cross-species conservation by biosynthetic process reflects derivation of related secondary metabolism from the GA primary biosynthetic pathway prior to the early divergence between the separate lineages within the cereal/grass family (Poaceae) resulting in modern rice and maize.
10341448	The GRAS gene family in Arabidopsis: sequence characterization and basic expression analysis of the SCARECROW-LIKE genes.	1999	Plant J	Mutations at the SCARECROW (SCR) locus in Arabidopsis thaliana result in defective radial patterning in the root and shoot. The SCR gene product contains sequences which suggest that it is a transcription factor. A number of Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have been identified that encode gene products bearing remarkable similarity to SCR throughout their carboxyl-termini, indicating that SCR is the prototype of a novel gene family. These ESTs have been designated SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL). The gene products of the GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE (GAI) and the REPRESSOR of ga1-3 (RGA) loci show high structural and sequence similarity to SCR and the SCLs. Sequence analysis of the products of the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) gene family indicates that they share a variable amino-terminus and a highly conserved carboxyl-terminus that contains five recognizable motifs. The SCLs have distinct patterns of expression, but all of those analyzed show expression in the root. One of them, SCL3, has a tissue-specific pattern of expression in the root similar to SCR. The importance of the GRAS gene family in plant biology has been established by the functional analyses of SCR, GAI and RGA.
15088147	Cloning of a putative monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants and its expression in response to submergence and other stresses.	2004	Planta	Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to construct a subtractive cDNA library from plants of non-submerged and 7-day-submerged rice (Oryza sativa L., FR13A, a submergence-tolerant cultivar). One clone of the subtractive cDNA library, S23, was expressed abundantly during submergence. The full length of S23 was amplified using 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and found to consist of 1,671 bp with an open reading frame of 1,077 bp (181-1257) encoding 358 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence showed a high homology with monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase (UDPgalactose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-D-galactosyl transferase; EC 2.4.1.46, MGDG synthase) from Arabidopsis thaliana; therefore, we named the gene OsMGD. Time-course studies showed that the expression of OsMGD in the rice cultivars FR13A and IR42 (submergence-susceptive cultivar) during submergence was gradually increased and that expression in FR13A was higher than in IR42. The expression of OsMGD in FR13A was influenced by benzyladenine and illumination. The accumulation of OsMGD mRNA in both FR13A and IR42 was also increased by ethephon, gibberellin, drought and salt treatment, but cold stress had no effect on the expression of the gene. These results suggest that the expression of OsMGD mRNA requires benzyladenine or illumination, and that the process is also mediated by ethephon and gibberellin. Salt and drought stress have an effect similar to that of submergence. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of OsMGD may relate to photosynthesis, and play an important role during submergence.
15645304	Identification and cloning of a submergence-induced gene OsGGT (glycogenin glucosyltransferase) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppression subtractive hybridization.	2005	Planta	A submergence-induced gene, OsGGT, was cloned from 7-day submerged rice (Oryza sativa L. plants, FR13A (a submergence-tolerant cultivar, Indica), using suppression subtractive hybridization and both 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length OsGGT cDNA contains 1,273 bp with an open reading frame of 1,140 bp (17-1,156) that encodes 379 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence is homologous with glycogenin glucosyltransferase. We found that the OsGGT gene is located in the 17,970-20,077 bp region of genome fragment AAAA01002475.1 of the Indica cultivar and in the 53,293-51,186 bp region of genome fragment AC037426.12 of chromosome 10 of the Japanica cultivar. A time-course study showed that OsGGT-gene expression increased in FR13A during submergence but decreased in IR42 (submergence-intolerant cultivar, Indica). The expression of the OsGGT gene in FR13A was induced by salicylic acid and benzyladenine. The accumulation of OsGGT mRNA in FR13A also increased in response to ethylene, gibberellin, abscisic acid, drought and salt treatment, but methyl jasmonate treatment and cold stress had no effect on expression. These results suggest that the OsGGT gene could be related to submergence stress and associated with a general defensive response to various environmental stresses.
12972663	Molecular cloning and functional analysis of a novel type of Bowman-Birk inhibitor gene family in rice.	2003	Plant Physiol	Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) genes encode serine protease inhibitors that have repetitive cysteine-rich domains with reactive sites for the trypsin or chymotrypsin family. We have identified seven BBI genes from japonica rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica var Teqing). All of the genes identified were found in a single cluster on the southern end of the long arm of rice chromosome 1. Four of the seven BBI genes have two repetitive cysteine-rich domains, whereas one has a truncated domain with only one reactive site. We have also identified three novel BBI genes, each of which possesses three repetitive domains instead of two. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that the accumulation of rice BBI transcripts was differentially regulated in germinating embryos and also in the leaves, roots, and flower organs at later developmental stages. Different members of the rice BBI gene family displayed different expression patterns during rice seed germination, and wounding induced the expression of rice BBI transcripts. The three-domain BBIs had higher expression levels than the two-domain BBIs. It was also found that the mRNA of rice BBI genes was present in abundant amounts in scutellar epithelium and aleurone layer cells. RBBI3-1, one of the three-domain RBBI, exhibited in vitro trypsin-inhibiting activity but no chymotrypsin-inhibiting activity. Overexpression of RBBI2-3 in transgenic rice plants resulted in resistance to the fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae, indicating that proteinase inhibitors confer resistance against the fungal pathogen in vivo and that they might play a role in the defense system of the rice plant.

11347904	Isolation and molecular characterization of the COP1 gene homolog from rice, Oryza sativa L. subsp. Indica var. Pusa Basmati 1.	2001	DNA Res	The COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) gene has been identified earlier from dicot species namely Arabidopsis, tomato and pea. The protein encoded by this gene acts as a molecular switch that negatively regulates the transition from the skotomorphogenic to the photomorphogenic mode of plant development. We have isolated and characterized the COP1 homolog from a monocot species, i.e. rice (var. Pusa Basmati 1). All the functional domains (Zn-binding RING finger motif, coiled-coil region, WD-40 repeats, cytoplasmic/nuclear localization sequences and protein-protein interaction domains) that are known in the COP1 proteins from dicots are conserved in COP1 from rice as well. The transcript levels of COP1 vary in various tissues of the rice plant. These variations were found to be development-dependent and do not solely depend on the light conditions.
12834068	The sugary-type isoamylase gene from rice and Aegilops tauschii: characterization and comparison with maize and arabidopsis.	2003	Genome	Genes for an isoamylase-like debranching enzyme have been isolated from rice and Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D genome to wheat. The structures of the genes are very similar to each other and to the maize SU1 isoamylase gene and consist of 18 exons spread over approximately 7.5 kb. Southern analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization showed the Ae. tauschii gene to be located in the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 7D, thus showing synteny with the localization of the rice isoamylase gene on rice chromosome 8. Analysis of the expression pattern of wheat sugary isoamylase genes indicates that they are strongly expressed in the developing endosperm 6 days after flowering. Three distinct Sugary-type cDNA sequences were isolated from the wheat endosperm that are likely to correspond to the products of the three genomes. The deduced amino acid sequence of rice and wheat Sugary-type isoamylase is compared with other sequences available in the database and the results demonstrate that there are three types of isoamylase sequences in plants: those containing 18 exons (the Sugary-type isoamylase gene), those containing 21 exons, and those containing only 1 exon. It is possible that different combinations of isoamylase genes are expressed in different tissues.
12970480	Differential metal selectivity and gene expression of two zinc transporters from rice.	2003	Plant Physiol	Zinc is an essential mineral for a wide variety of physiological and biochemical processes. To understand zinc transport in cereals, we identified putative zinc transporters in gene databases. Three full-length cDNAs were identified and characterized from rice (Oryza sativa). Two of the cDNAs partially complemented a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant deficient in zinc uptake at low concentrations. The two transporters showed many similarities in function but differed in ionic selectivity and pH optimum of activity. Expression patterns also differed between the two genes. One gene was broadly expressed under all conditions, and the other gene was mainly induced by zinc deficiency to higher levels in roots than in leaves. Although the timing of expression differed between the two genes, localization of expression overlapped in roots. Comparisons of the protein sequences, ionic selectivity, and gene expression patterns of the two transporters suggest that they may play different roles in the physiology of the whole plant.
9878846	Isolation, analysis and expression of homologues of the soybean early nodulin gene GmENOD93 (GmN93) from rice.	1998	Biochim Biophys Acta	Rice (Oryza sativa var. Nipponbare) possesses two different homologues of the soybean early nodulin gene GmENOD93 (GmN93). Analysis of the cDNA clones of rice homologues showed that OsENOD93a has an open reading frame (ORF) with a coding sequence homology of 58.2% to GmENOD93, whereas the ORF of OsENOD93b has displayed a homology of 42.3%. OsENOD93a and OsENOD93b genes are differentially expressed in different parts of the rice plant, as well as in cultured cells induced or non-induced with chitin oligomer. In intact rice tissues, OsENOD93b was most abundantly expressed in roots and at much lower levels in etiolated and green leaves, whereas the expression of OsENOD93a was very low in roots and etiolated leaves, and was not detected in green leaves. The level of OsENOD93a expression was enhanced markedly in suspension-cultured cells, whereas that of OsENOD93b did not increase. The application of chitin oligomer, an elicitor which induces a defence response in plants, did not significantly alter the expression of both these homologues in suspension cultures.

8499615	Circadian rhythmicity in the expression of a novel light-regulated rice gene.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We have identified and analyzed cDNAs corresponding to a single-copy gene from rice, designated lir1, whose expression exhibits dramatic diurnal fluctuations. The cDNAs encode a putative protein of 128 amino acids with no homology to known proteins. Lir1 mRNA accumulates in the light, reaching maximum and minimum steady-state levels at the end of the light and dark period, respectively. The oscillations of lir1 mRNA abundance persist after the plants have been transferred to continuous light or darkness. Plants germinated in the dark have very low levels of lir1 mRNA, whereas plants germinated in continuous light express lir1 at an intermediate but constant level. These results indicate that lir1 expression is controlled by light and a circadian clock.

16155566	A rice quantitative trait locus for salt tolerance encodes a sodium transporter.	2005	Nat Genet	Many important agronomic traits in crop plants, including stress tolerance, are complex traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Isolation of these QTLs holds great promise to improve world agriculture but is a challenging task. We previously mapped a rice QTL, SKC1, that maintained K(+) homeostasis in the salt-tolerant variety under salt stress, consistent with the earlier finding that K(+) homeostasis is important in salt tolerance. To understand the molecular basis of this QTL, we isolated the SKC1 gene by map-based cloning and found that it encoded a member of HKT-type transporters. SKC1 is preferentially expressed in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels. Voltage-clamp analysis showed that SKC1 protein functions as a Na(+)-selective transporter. Physiological analysis suggested that SKC1 is involved in regulating K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis under salt stress, providing a potential tool for improving salt tolerance in crops.
9232881	Differential induction of pyruvate decarboxylase subunits and transcripts in anoxic rice seedlings.	1997	Plant Physiol	In 2-d-old rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings subjected to anoxic stress, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activity increased 9-fold during a 168-h period. A polyclonal PDC antiserum that recognized alpha- and beta-subunits was used to quantify PDC protein by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and showed a 5.6-fold increase, suggesting that the anoxically induced enzyme has a higher specific activity than the PDC isoform present under normoxia. Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of both PDC subunits were induced by anoxia. Immunoprecipitation of proteins labeled in vivo during anoxic treatment demonstrated that the alpha-subunit was preferentially synthesized at the onset of anoxia. Two partial cDNAs, including a novel sequence, were cloned from a cDNA library made from seedlings subjected to anoxia for 6 h. Gene-specific probes used to quantify northern blots showed that two or three PDC mRNAs are differentially induced by anoxia in rice seedlings. Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products of mRNAs isolated a different times of anoxic treatment confirmed this findings Our results suggest that anoxic induction of rice PDC involves transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression as well as differences in enzyme characteristics.
9858757	Characterization of rice endo-beta-glucanase genes (Gns2-Gns14) defines a new subgroup within the gene family.	1998	Gene	Thirteen new beta-glucanase-encoding genes have been identified in the rice genome. These genes, together with other monocot beta-glucanases, have now been classified into four subfamilies based on the structure and function of the genes. Two tandem gene clusters, Gns2-Gns3-Gns4 and Gns5-Gns6, were classified in the defense-related Subfamily A. Growth-related 1,3;1,4-beta-glucanase Gns1 was classified in Subfamily B. Gns7 and Gns8, together with the barley genes GVI and Hv34, represent Subfamily C. Gns9 and a beta-glucanase gene from wheat were grouped in Subfamily D. Genes in Subfamilies C and D have structures that are distinct from those of the other subfamilies, but there are very little data available on the biochemical or physiological roles of these genes. Gene expression in growing tissues and lack of gene induction in response to disease-related treatments suggest that Subfamilies C and D may function in control of plant growth.
10675523	Characterization of a cDNA encoding a rice mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and its gene expression studied upon plant development and osmotic stress.	2000	Biochim Biophys Acta	The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of mitochondria forms a large pore in the outer envelope membrane. Here, the full Oryza sativa OSVDAC1 cDNA was sequenced and is shown to belong to a small multigene family in the rice genome. This cDNA is 1093 bp long and codes for a protein of 274 amino acids. Expression studies of the osvdac1 gene show a regulation of its level in function of the plantlets maturation and organs. In contrast with several bacterial porins, osmotic stress does not have any effect on the plant osvdac1 gene expression.
11340194	The maize golden2 gene defines a novel class of transcriptional regulators in plants.	2001	Plant Cell	In the C4 plant maize, three photosynthetic cell types differentiate: C4 bundle sheath, C4 mesophyll, and C3 mesophyll cells. C3 mesophyll cells represent the ground state, whereas C4 bundle sheath and C4 mesophyll cells are specialized cells that differentiate in response to light-induced positional signals. The Golden2 (G2) gene regulates plastid biogenesis in all photosynthetic cells during the C3 stages of development. However, G2 function is specifically committed to the differentiation of bundle sheath cell chloroplasts in C4 leaf blades. In this article, we report the isolation of G2-like (Glk) genes from maize and rice, providing evidence for a family of Glk genes in plants. The expression profiles of the rice Glk genes suggest that these genes may act redundantly to promote photosynthetic development in this C3 species. In maize, G2 and ZmGlk1 transcripts accumulate primarily in C4 bundle sheath and C4 mesophyll cells, respectively, suggesting a specific role for each gene in C4 differentiation. We show that G2 and ZmGLK1 both can transactivate reporter gene transcription and dimerize in yeast, which supports the idea that these proteins act as transcriptional regulators of cell-type differentiation processes.
2103460	Structure and expression of a light-inducible shoot-specific rice gene.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	By differential screening of a cDNA library of two-week-old rice seedlings cDNA clones were obtained, corresponding to shoot-specific mRNAs. By sequence analysis two of these clones were found to be rbcS cDNA clones. The mRNA corresponding to a third cDNA clone (COS5) displayed an expression pattern similar to the expression pattern of rbcS genes. The mRNA (800 bases) was light-inducible and encoded by a single-copy gene. The genomic clone (GOS5) was isolated and the intron/exon structure was determined by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the mRNA and the genomic clone. The gene contains two introns. Transcription start sites were determined by S1-nuclease mapping and primer extension. The start site obtained by both methods is located 87 bp upstream of the translation start site and 23 bp downstream of TATA box-like sequence. In the 5' non-coding region motifs can be found that are homologous to sequences in promoters that are light- or UV-inducible or confer leaf-specific expression. The open reading frame present in GOS5 codes for a protein (15 kDa) that contains a putative chloroplast transit peptide and does not show any significant homology to protein sequences in the NBRF protein database.
10929125	Over-expression of a single Ca2+-dependent protein kinase confers both cold and salt/drought tolerance on rice plants.	2000	Plant J	A rice gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), OsCDPK7, was induced by cold and salt stresses. To elucidate the physiological function of OsCDPK7, we generated transgenic rice plants with altered levels of the protein. The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of these plants correlated well with the level of OsCDPK7 expression. Therefore, OsCDPK7 was shown to be a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to both stresses in rice. Over-expression of OsCDPK7 enhanced induction of some stress-responsive genes in response to salinity/drought, but not to cold. Thus, it was suggested that the downstream pathways leading to the cold and salt/drought tolerance are different from each other. It seems likely that at least two distinct pathways commonly use a single CDPK, maintaining the signalling specificity through unknown post-translational regulation mechanisms. These results demonstrate that simple manipulation of CDPK activity has great potential with regard to plant improvement.
15514070	Allelic diversification at the C (OsC1) locus of wild and cultivated rice: nucleotide changes associated with phenotypes.	2004	Genetics	Divergent phenotypes are often detected in domesticated plants despite the existence of invariant phenotypes in their wild forms. One such example in rice is the occurrence of varying degrees of apiculus coloration due to anthocyanin pigmentation, which was previously reported to be caused by a series of alleles at the C locus. The present study reveals, on the basis of comparison of its maps, that the C gene appears to be the rice homolog (OsC1) of maize C1, which belongs to the group of R2R3-Myb factors. Two different types of deletions causing a frameshift were detected in the third exon, and both of the deleted nucleotides corresponded to the positions of putative base-contacting residues, suggesting that the Indica and Japonica types carry loss-of-function mutations with independent origins. In addition, replacement substitutions were frequently detected in OsC1 of strains carrying the previously defined C alleles. Molecular population analysis revealed that 17 haplotypes were found in 39 wild and cultivated rices, and the haplotypes of most cultivated forms could be classified into one of three distinct groups, with few shared haplotypes among taxa, including Indica and Japonica types. The genealogy of the OsC1 gene suggests that allelic diversification causing phenotypic change might have resulted from mutations in the coding region rather than from recombination between preexisting alleles. The McDonald and Kreitman test revealed that the changes in amino acids might be associated with selective forces acting on the lineage of group A whose haplotypes were carried by most Asian cultivated forms. The results regarding a significant implication for genetic diversity in landraces of rice are also discussed.
8843945	Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase isoforms from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) is an electrogenic H+ pump, which was found in the plant vacuolar membrane. Two cDNA clones (OVP1 and OVP2) encoding the V-PPase were isolated from cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells and subsequently sequenced. The sequence analysis has revealed that OVP1 contains 2316 nucleotides of open reading frame (ORF) and 362 nucleotides of the 3'-untranslated region, whereas OVP2 comprises 2304 nucleotides of ORF and 312 nucleotides of the 3'-untranslated region. The nucleotide sequences of ORF of OVP1 and OVP2 are 80.7% identical, and their 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions have 39.4% and 48.4% identity, respectively. The polypeptides encoded by the ORF of OVP1 and OVP2 contain 771 and 767 amino acids, respectively, and the sequences of the OVP proteins are very similar to those of other V-PPases, which are shown to have 85-91% homology. Chromosomal mapping by RFLP techniques demonstrates that OVP1 and OVP2 are isoforms encoded by different genes. Both OVP1 and OVP2 are mapped on the same chromosome (chromosome 6) to a distance of ca.90 cM. Northern analysis indicates that the OVP1 and OVP2 are also expressed in intact rice plants and OVP2 shows higher expression in the calli than the roots and shoots, compared to OVP1. These results show that at least two genes encoding the V-PPases are present in rice genome and their expressions are probably regulated in a different manner.
9931464	Identification of the gene structure and promoter region of H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase in rice (Oryza sativa L. ).	1999	Biochim Biophys Acta	In order to determine the gene structure and promoter region of vacuolar H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase), we isolated the genomic clones using a rice BAC library and probes derived from rice V-PPase cDNA (OVP1). The entire OVP1 gene is approx. 5.4 kb in length, and seven introns interrupt the coding sequence of OVP1. The first intron is extremely large (1869 bp), while the other introns are between 82 and 170 bp. A transcription initiation site, identified by a primer extension analysis, indicated the first exon to be 366 bp. A 1.1 kb fragment containing the 5'-flanking region of the first exon with the GUS reporter gene showed specific promoter activity in rice cells. These data show that the OVP1 gene is composed of eight exons and seven introns, and regulatory elements are present within 1.1 kb upstream from the first exon.

1568478	Genomic structure of the gene for copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase in rice.	1992	FEBS Lett	We have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene (sodB) coding for one of the copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) isozymes from rice plants (Oryza sativa L.). The sodB gene is split into 8 exons spread about 2 kb of the chromosomal DNA, with the coding sequence beginning in the 2nd and ending in the 8th. Although none of sodB introns are inserted into similar positions in Cu/Zn-SOD genes from other sources, four of six introns in the protein-coding region are located at discriminating positions within structural domains of the protein. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD is coded for by 2-3 genes in the rice genome.

Utilizing transient beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter assays, functional promoter-GUS analysis was performed in rice protoplasts exposed to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) or the antioxidant sulfhydryl reagent, dithiothreitol (DTT). Transcriptional activities from both SodCc-GUS fusions were stimulated by DTT, which induces the promoter activity of the tobacco SodCc gene [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993) 3108-3112]. ABA had no effect on SodCcl-GUS expression but specifically induced the gene expression of the SodCc2-GUS fusion. The simultaneous application of ABA and gibberellin A3, however, abolished the enhancing effect of ABA. These results indicated that two rice SodCc promoters differentially respond to externally supplied ABA and that one of the regulatory factors for plant SodCc expression is ABA in addition to cellular redox-modulating antioxidants.
10487219	Chemical induction of disease resistance in rice is correlated with the expression of a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Probenazole (3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) is an agricultural chemical primarily used to prevent rice blast disease. Probenazole-treated rice acquires resistance to blast fungus irrespective of the rice variety. The chemical is applied prophylactically, and is thought to induce or bolster endogenous plant defenses. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been established. To understand the mode of the chemical's action, we screened for novel probenazole-responsive genes in rice by means of differential display and identified a candidate gene, RPR1. RPR1 contains a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats, thus sharing structural similarity with known disease resistance genes. The expression of RPR1 in rice can be up-regulated by treatment with chemical inducers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and by inoculation with pathogens. RPR1-related sequences in rice varieties seem to be varied in sequence and/or expression, indicating that RPR1 itself is not a crucial factor for induced resistance in rice. However, Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of homologous sequences in all varieties examined. While the role of RPR1 has yet to be clarified, this is the first report of the identification of a member of this gene class and its induction during the systemic expression of induced disease resistance.

11244129	Expression of a gibberellin 2-oxidase gene around the shoot apex is related to phase transition in rice.	2001	Plant Physiol	A major catabolic pathway for gibberellin (GA) is initiated by 2beta-hydroxylation, a reaction catalyzed by GA 2-oxidase. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA, designated Oryza sativa GA 2-oxidase 1 (OsGA2ox1) from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) that encodes a GA 2-oxidase. The encoded protein, produced by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, converted GA(1), GA(4), GA(9), GA(20), and GA(44) to the corresponding 2beta-hydroxylated products GA(8), GA(34), GA(51), GA(29), and GA(98), respectively. Ectopic expression of the OsGA2ox1 cDNA in transgenic rice inhibited stem elongation and the development of reproductive organs. These transgenic plants were deficient in endogenous GA(1). These results indicate that OsGA2ox1 encodes a GA 2-oxidase, which is functional not only in vitro but also in vivo. OsGA2ox1 was expressed in shoot apex and roots but not in leaves and stems. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsGA2ox1 mRNA was localized in a ring at the basal region of leaf primordia and young leaves. This ring-shaped expression around the shoot apex was drastically decreased after the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. It was absent in the floral meristem, but it was still present in the lateral meristem that remained in the vegetative phase. These observations suggest that OsGA2ox1 controls the level of bioactive GAs in the shoot apical meristem; therefore, reduction in its expression may contribute to the early development of the inflorescence meristem.
12362332	Proteomic analysis of rice leaves during drought stress and recovery.	2002	Proteomics	Three-week old plants of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv CT9993 and cv IR62266) developed gradual water stress over 23 days of transpiration without watering, during which period the mid-day leaf water potential declined to approximately -2.4 MPa, compared with approximately -1.0 MPa in well-watered controls. More than 1000 protein spots that were detected in leaf extracts by proteomic analysis showed reproducible abundance within replications. Of these proteins, 42 spots showed a significant change in abundance under stress, with 27 of them exhibiting a different response pattern in the two cultivars. However, only one protein (chloroplast Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase) changed significantly in opposite directions in the two cultivars in response to drought. The most common difference was for proteins to be up-regulated by drought in CT9993 and unaffected in IR62266; or down-regulated by drought in IR62266 and unaffected in CT9993. By 10 days after rewatering, all proteins had returned completely or largely to the abundance of the well-watered control. Mass spectrometry helped to identify 16 of the drought-responsive proteins, including an actin depolymerizing factor, which was one of three proteins detectable under stress in both cultivars but undetectable in well-watered plants or in plants 10 days after rewatering. The most abundant protein up-regulated by drought in CT9993 and IR62266 was identified only after cloning of the corresponding cDNA. It was found to be an S-like RNase homologue but it lacked the two active site histidines required for RNase activity. Four novel drought-responsive mechanisms were revealed by this work: up-regulation of S-like RNase homologue, actin depolymerizing factor and rubisco activase, and down-regulation of isoflavone reductase-like protein.
11437252	Identification of a cytoskeleton-associated 120 kDa RNA-binding protein in developing rice seeds.	2001	Plant Mol Biol	During rice seed development, prolamine RNAs are localized to the surface of the prolamine storage protein bodies (PBs), organelles bounded by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The exact mechanism by which prolamine RNAs are enriched on this ER subdomain is not known but recent evidence indicates the directed transport and targeting of prolamine RNAs to the prolamine PBs. As such a process involves RNA signal determinants and cytoskeleton-interacting proteins that recognize these signals, we obtained an enriched cytoskeleton-PB fraction and identified a prominent RNA-binding activity, Rp120, by RNA-binding UV-cross-linking assay. Recombinant cDNA clones of Rp120 revealed that the primary sequence shared considerable structural homology to the human transcriptional coactivator p100 and possessed a modular organization, four nucleic acid-binding SN domains, a tudor domain and a coil-coil domain. Consistent with the presence of SN domains, Rp120 binds a variety of RNAs including prolamine RNA. Interaction with the latter RNA, however, was specific as binding activity was evident only to the prolamine 3' UTR and not to the 5' UTR or coding sequences. Rp120 is also able to interact with other proteins as its sedimentation behavior in sucrose density gradient suggests an association with the cytoskeleton. The presence of a tudor domain, suggested to have a role in RNA processing or transport, together with the SN and coiled-coil domains are consistent with the view that Rp120 may be involved in RNA sorting in rice endosperm.
9061016	Cloning of a cDNA that encodes farnesyl diphosphate synthase and the blue-light-induced expression of the corresponding gene in the leaves of rice plants.	1997	Biochim Biophys Acta	A cDNA encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a key enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis, was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA that had been prepared from etiolated rice (Oriza sativa L. variety Nipponbare) seedlings after three hours of illumination by a subtraction method. The putative polypeptide deduced from the 1289 bp nucleotide sequence consisted of 353 amino acids and had a molecular mass of 40 676 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibited high homology to those of FPPS from Arabidopsis (73% to type 1, 72% to type 2) and white lupin (74%). Southern blot analysis showed that the rice genome might contain only one gene for FPPS. The highest level of expression of the gene was demonstrated in leaves by RNA blot analysis. Moreover, light, in particular blue light, effectively enhanced expression of the gene.
10353221	Localization of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in chloroplasts.	1999	Plant Cell Physiol	The subcellular localization of plant farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) was examined. Immunocytochemical staining using anti-FPPS1 antibody followed by electron microscopy showed that FPPS1 was localized to chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells. Subcellular fractions from wheat leaves were examined by immunoblot analysis. FPPS was detected in the chloroplast fraction in wheat, and was protected from proteolysis following trypsin treatment of chloroplasts. FPPS was also detected in the chloroplast fraction of a dicot plant, tobacco.
1715972	A novel ras-related rgp1 gene encoding a GTP-binding protein has reduced expression in 5-azacytidine-induced dwarf rice.	1991	Mol Gen Genet	Exposure of normal, tall rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings to 5-azacytidine, a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation in vivo, induced both demethylation of genomic DNA and dwarf plants. Genes that had been affected by treatment were identified by differential screening of a cDNA library, and a ras-related gene, rgp1, was subsequently isolated. The cDNA of rgp1 was found to encode a deduced protein sequence of 226 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 24850, which was most closely related to the ras-related ypt3 protein of fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The rgp1 protein, expressed in transformed Escherichia coli, clearly showed GTP-binding activity. During seedling rgp1 expression was first observed 14 days after germination, reaching a maximum level between 28 and 42 days, and gradually decreased thereafter until 63 days when it attained the same level of expression as in 14-day-old seedlings. Expression of rgp1 was found to be markedly reduced throughout the growth period of both 5-azacytidine-induced dwarf plants and their progenies, relative to levels in untreated tall control plants. These results suggest that expression of rgp1 may be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by DNA methylation, and that the rgp1 protein may play an important role in plant growth and development.
12795701	The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox gene Bkn3.	2003	Plant J	In the dominant mutant Hooded (K), the barley gene BKn3 is overexpressed as a result of a duplication of 305 bp in intron IV. When fused to a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S minimal promoter, the 305 bp element activates gene expression in tobacco, as does a 655 bp BKn3 promoter sequence. Both DNA fragments contain a (GA)8 repeat (GA/TC)8. A one-hybrid screen using the 305 bp element as the DNA target led to the cloning of the barley b recombinant (BBR) protein, which binds specifically to the (GA/TC)8 repeat. BBR is nuclear targeted and is a characterized nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, a DNA-binding domain extended up to 90 aa at the C-terminus and a putative N-terminal activation domain. The corresponding gene has no introns and is ubiquitously expressed in barley tissues. In co-transfection experiments, BBR activates (GA/TC)8-containing promoters, and its overexpression in tobacco leads to a pronounced leaf shape modification. BBR has properties of a GAGA-binding factor, but the corresponding gene has no sequence homology to Trl and Psq of Drosophila, which encode functionally analogous proteins. In Arabidopsis, (GA/TC)8 repeats occur particularly within 1500 bp upstream of gene start codons included in some homeodomain genes of different classes. The data presented suggest that expression of the barley BKn3 is regulated, at least in part, by the binding of the transcription factor BBR to GA/TC repeats.
11961544	Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice.	2002	Nature	The chronic food shortage that was feared after the rapid expansion of the world population in the 1960s was averted largely by the development of a high-yielding semi-dwarf variety of rice known as IR8, the so-called rice 'green revolution'. The short stature of IR8 is due to a mutation in the plant's sd1 gene, and here we identify this gene as encoding an oxidase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellin, a plant growth hormone. Gibberellin is also implicated in green-revolution varieties of wheat, but the reduced height of those crops is conferred by defects in the hormone's signalling pathway.
7987417	Toward cataloguing all rice genes: large-scale sequencing of randomly chosen rice cDNAs from a callus cDNA library.	1994	Plant J	A large-scale sequence analysis of rice cDNA was performed for a library from rice callus cultured in a medium containing 1 p.p.m. of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Random sequencing of 2778 cDNA clones generated 2259 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The strategy of sequencing cDNAs can yield quickly a large number of novel genes. After translation, 690 sequences showed a significant amino acid sequence similarity to sequences already known from PIR. The source of known proteins ranged from bacteria to human. In this report, the non-redundant set of 280 identified ESTs is analyzed in detail.
12447438	The genome sequence and structure of rice chromosome 1.	2002	Nature	The rice species Oryza sativa is considered to be a model plant because of its small genome size, extensive genetic map, relative ease of transformation and synteny with other cereal crops. Here we report the essentially complete sequence of chromosome 1, the longest chromosome in the rice genome. We summarize characteristics of the chromosome structure and the biological insight gained from the sequence. The analysis of 43.3 megabases (Mb) of non-overlapping sequence reveals 6,756 protein coding genes, of which 3,161 show homology to proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana, another model plant. About 30% (2,073) of the genes have been functionally categorized. Rice chromosome 1 is (G + C)-rich, especially in its coding regions, and is characterized by several gene families that are dispersed or arranged in tandem repeats. Comparison with a draft sequence indicates the importance of a high-quality finished sequence.
10854779	Primary structural features of the 20S proteasome subunits of rice (Oryza sativa).	2000	Gene	The 20S proteasome is the proteolytic complex that is involved in removing abnormal proteins, and it also has other diverse biological functions. Its structure comprises 28 subunits arranged in four rings of seven subunits, and exists as a hollow cylinder. The two outer rings and two inner rings form an alpha7beta7beta7alpha7 structure, and each subunit, alpha and beta, exists as seven different types, thus giving 14 kinds of subunits. In this study, we report the primary structures of the 14 proteasomal subunit subfamilies in rice (Oryza sativa), representing the first set for all of the subunits from monocots. Amino acid sequence homology within the rice family (alpha-type: 28.9-42.1%; beta-type: 17.2-31. 9%) were lower than those between rice subunits and corresponding orthologs from Arabidopsis and yeast (alpha-type: 49.2-94.5%; beta-type: 34.8-87.7%). Structural features observed in eukaryotic proteasome subunits, i.e., alpha- or beta-type signature at the N-termini, Thr active sites in beta1, beta2 and beta5 subunits, and nuclear localization signal-like sequences in some alpha-type subunits, were shown to be conserved in rice.
9869405	Isolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	In many eukaryotic organisms including plants, homeobox genes are thought to be master regulators that establish the cellular or regional identities and specify the fundamental body plan. We isolated and characterized a cDNA designated OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15) that encodes a KNOTTED-type homeodomain protein. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OSH15 cDNA showed a dramatically altered morphological phenotype caused by disturbance of specific aspects of tobacco development, thereby indicating the involvement of OSH15 in plant development. We analyzed the in situ mRNA localization of OSH15 through the whole plant life cycle, comparing the expression pattern with that of another rice homeobox gene, OSH1. In early embryogenesis, both genes were expressed as the same pattern at a region where the shoot apical meristem would develop later. In late embryogenesis, the expression pattern of the two genes became different. Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs. This pattern of expression was similar to that observed around vegetative or reproductive shoots, or the floral meristem in mature plants. RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem.
7742859	Gibberellin promotes histone H1 kinase activity and the expression of cdc2 and cyclin genes during the induction of rapid growth in deepwater rice internodes.	1995	Plant J	Partial submergence or treatment with either ethylene or gibberellin (GA) promotes rapid internodal growth in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.). Earlier work has shown that GA is the immediate hormonal signal for this growth response, which involves induction of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase transition and subsequent enhancement in the rate of DNA synthesis. In all eukaryotes, onset of mitosis is regulated by the p34cdc2/CDC28 protein kinase, whose activity is assayed by in vitro phosphorylation of histone H1. It was found that GA enhanced the activity of p34cdc2/CDC28-like histone H1 kinase in the intercalary meristem of rice internodes. The enzyme activity showed a sharp peak that correlated with a decrease in the population of cells in the G2 phase during the first 4 h of GA treatment but not with changes in DNA synthesis. The level of histone H1 kinase activity increased again when cell division activity in the intercalary meristem is known to be high. The expression of two cdc2 homologs was examined. The mRNA level of one of these, cdc2Os-2, was increased after 1 h of GA treatment, whereas the mRNA level of the other, cdc2Os-1, was not affected. Two cDNAs, cycOs1 and cycOs2, which show high homology to cyclin cDNAs, were cloned from rice. They share 75.1% sequence identity at the amino acid level, and both of them are encoded by mRNAs of 1.6 kb. Expression of the two corresponding cyclin genes was enhanced by GA, and the time course of the induction was compatible with a role for both cyclins in regulating the G2/M phase transition. The cyclins were expressed in the intercalary meristem and the elongation zone of the internode, but the GA-induced increase in transcript levels was restricted to the meristem only. The results support the hypothesis that induction of mitosis by GA is brought about by increased p34cdc2/CDC28 protein kinase activity, which may be the result of transcriptional activation of the cdc2Os-2, cycOs1 and cycOs2 genes.
12432025	The novel ethylene-regulated gene OsUsp1 from rice encodes a member of a plant protein family related to prokaryotic universal stress proteins.	2002	J Exp Bot	Using subtractive hybridization a submergence-induced gene was identified from deepwater rice, OsUsp1, that encodes a homologue of the bacterial universal stress protein family. Sequence analysis revealed that OsUSP1 is most closely related to the bacterial MJ0577-type of ATP-binding USP proteins which have been suggested to act as a molecular switch. USP protein homologues appear to be ubiquitous in plants and are encoded by gene families, but are absent in animal species. In the youngest internode of deepwater rice plants, OsUsp1 expression was very strongly induced within 1 h of submergence. Elevated transcript levels were observed in dividing cells, in expanding cells and in differentiated tissue indicating that USP1 mediates a general process. Gene induction was shown to be regulated by ethylene with a highly similar expression pattern to that observed with submergence treatment. Based on sequence information and on expression data it is hypothesized that OsUSP1 plays a role in ethylene-mediated stress adaptation in rice.
15557090	Functional analysis of methylthioribose kinase genes in plants.	2004	Plant Physiol	Through a biochemical and a genetic approach, we have identified several plant genes encoding methylthioribose (MTR) kinase, an enzyme involved in recycling of methionine through the methylthioadenosine (MTA) cycle. OsMTK1, an MTR kinase from rice (Oryza sativa), is 48.6 kD in size and shows cooperative kinetics with a V(max) of 4.9 pmol/min and a K0.5 of 16.8 microm. MTR kinase genes are the first genes to be identified from the MTA cycle in plants. Insertional mutagenesis of the unique AtMTK gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in an inability of plants to grow on MTA as a supplemental sulfur source. MTK knock-out plants were not impaired in growth under standard conditions, indicating that the MTA cycle is a nonessential metabolic pathway in Arabidopsis when sulfur levels are replete. In rice, OsMTK genes were strongly up-regulated in shoots and roots when plants were exposed to sulfur starvation. Gene expression was largely unaffected by lack of nitrogen or iron in the nutrient solution, indicating that OsMTK regulation was linked specifically to sulfur metabolism.
16297065	The immediate-early ethylene response gene OsARD1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine.	2005	Plant J	Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is formed as a by-product of ethylene biosynthesis from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). The methionine cycle regenerates AdoMet from MTA. In two independent differential screens for submergence-induced genes and for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-induced genes from deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) we identified an acireductone dioxygenase (ARD). OsARD1 is a metal-binding protein that belongs to the cupin superfamily. Acireductone dioxygenases are unique proteins that can acquire two different activities depending on the metal ion bound. Ectopically expressed apo-OsARD1 preferentially binds Fe(2+) and reconstituted Fe-OsARD1 catalyzed the formation of 2-keto-pentanoate and formate from the model substrate 1,2-dihydroxy-3-ketopent-1-ene and dioxygen, indicating that OsARD1 is capable of catalyzing the penultimate step in the methionine cycle. Two highly homologous ARD genes were identified in rice. OsARD1 mRNA levels showed a rapid, early and transient increase upon submergence and after treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds. The second gene from rice, OsARD2, is constitutively expressed. Accumulation of OsARD1 transcript was observed in the same internodal tissues, i.e. the meristem and elongation zone, which were previously shown to synthesize ethylene. OsARD1 transcripts accumulated in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, indicating that OsARD1 is a primary ethylene response gene. Promoter analysis suggests that immediate-early regulation of OsARD1 by ethylene may involve an EIN3-like transcription factor. OsARD1 is induced by low levels of ethylene. We propose that early feedback activation of the methionine cycle by low levels of ethylene ensures the high and continuous rates of ethylene synthesis required for long-term ethylene-mediated submergence adaptation without depleting the tissue of AdoMet.
10323860	FILAMENTOUS FLOWER, a meristem and organ identity gene of Arabidopsis, encodes a protein with a zinc finger and HMG-related domains.	1999	Genes Dev	Distinctive from that of the animal system, the basic plan of the plant body is the continuous formation of a structural unit, composed of a stem with a meristem at the top and lateral organs continuously forming at the meristem. Therefore, mechanisms controlling the formation, maintenance, and development of a meristem will be a key to understanding the body plan of higher plants. Genetic analyses of filamentous flower (fil) mutants have indicated that FIL is required for the maintenance and growth of inflorescence and floral meristems, and of floral organs of Arabidopsis thaliana. FIL encodes a protein carrying a zinc finger and a HMG box-like domain, which is known to work as a transcription regulator. As expected, the FIL protein was shown to have a nuclear location. In situ hybridization clearly demonstrated that FIL is expressed only at the abaxial side of primordia of leaves and floral organs. Transgenic plants, ectopically expressing FIL, formed filament-like leaves with randomly arranged cells at the leaf margin. Our results indicate that cells at the abaxial side of the lateral organs are responsible for the normal development of the organs as well as for maintaining the activity of meristems.
15118317	Enhanced resistance to blast fungus and bacterial blight in transgenic rice constitutively expressing OsSBP, a rice homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The rice Oryza sativa selenium-binding protein homologue (OsSBP) gene encodes a homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins, and it has been isolated as one of the genes induced by treating a plant with a cerebroside elicitor from rice blast fungus. The possible role of OsSBP in plant defense was evaluated by using a transgenic approach. Plants overexpressing OsSBP showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight. The expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the OsSBP overexpressors. A higher level of H(2)O(2) accumulation and reduced activity of such scavenging enzymes as ascorbate peroxidase and catalase were seen when the OsSBP-overexpressing plants were treated with the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, calyculin A. These results suggest that the upregulation of OsSBP expression conferred enhanced tolerance to different pathogens, possibly by increasing plant sensitivity to endogenous defense responses. Additionally, the OsSBP protein might have a role in modulating the defense mechanism to biotic stress in rice.
10998053	Characterization of RCI-1, a chloroplastic rice lipoxygenase whose synthesis is induced by chemical plant resistance activators.	2000	Eur J Biochem	A full-length lipoxygenase cDNA (RCI-1) has been cloned from rice (Oryza sativa) whose corresponding transcripts accumulate in response to treatment of the plants with chemical inducers of acquired resistance such as benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), and probenazole. In contrast, RCI-1 transcript levels did not increase after inoculation with compatible and incompatible races of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. RCI-1 transcript levels also increased after exogenous application of jasmonic acid, but not upon wounding. Dose-response and time course experiments revealed a similar pattern of transcript accumulation and lipoxygenase activity in BTH-treated rice leaves. Enzymatic analysis of recombinant RCI-1 protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed that 13-hydroperoxy-octadecanoic acids were the predominant reaction products when either linoleic or linolenic acid used as a substrate. The RCI-1 sequence features a putative chloroplast targeting sequence at its N-terminus. Indeed, a protein consisting of the putative chloroplast transit peptide fused to green fluorescent protein was exclusively localized in chloroplasts, indicating that RCI-1 is a chloroplastic enzyme.
9225866	Characterization and expression of a rice RAD23 gene.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	In order to identify proteins that interact with plant transcriptional complexes, we performed a two-hybrid screen in yeast using a cDNA library from embryogenic rice suspension cultures and the plant transcriptional activator viviparous-1 (vp1) as 'bait'. In this screen, we detected an interaction between VP1 and a rice homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23 gene (osRAD23). The RAD23 protein is associated with the general transcriptional machinery in yeast, and is believed to play a role in the processes of nucleotide excision repair in yeast and mammalian cells. This report is the first identification of a RAD23 homolog in plants. The osRAD23 amino acid sequence shares 50-60% similarity throughout its length with RAD23 sequences from yeast, mice, and man. osRAD23 contains a characteristic ubiquitin-like domain at its N-terminus, which is similar to other RAD23 genes. Analysis of the expressed sequence tag database identifies two different classes of RAD23 genes in both Arabidopsis and rice. Southern analysis of rice genomic DNA indicated the presence of at least two RAD23-like genes. A single transcript (1.5 kb) of osRAD23 was detected in total RNA from rice embryonic tissue, while three transcripts (1.8, 1.5 and 1.0 kb) were observed in total RNA from vegetative tissues of rice.
10488233	Regional expression of the rice KN1-type homeobox gene family during embryo, shoot, and flower development.	1999	Plant Cell	We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice. Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1 homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.
15682279	OsMADS22, an STMADS11-like MADS-box gene of rice, is expressed in non-vegetative tissues and its ectopic expression induces spikelet meristem indeterminacy.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	We report the cDNA sequence and gene expression patterns of OsMADS22, a novel member of the STMADS11-like family of MADS-box genes, from rice. In contrast to previously reported STMADS11-like genes, whose expression is detected in vegetative tissues, OsMADS22 is mainly expressed during embryogenesis and flower development. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsMADS22 expression is localized in the L1 layer of embryos and in developing stamen primordia. Ectopic expression of OsMADS22 in transgenic rice plants resulted in aberrant floral morphogenesis, characterized by a disorganized palea, an elongated glume, and a two-floret spikelet. The results are discussed in terms of rice spikelet development and a novel non-vegetative role for a STMADS11-like gene.
7766894	Molecular cloning and characterization of RGA1 encoding a G protein alpha subunit from rice (Oryza sativa L. IR-36).	1995	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA clone, RGA1, was isolated by using a GPA1 cDNA clone of Arabidopsis thaliana G protein alpha subunit as a probe from a rice (Oryza sativa L. IR-36) seedling cDNA library from roots and leaves. Sequence analysis of genomic clone reveals that the RGA1 gene has 14 exons and 13 introns, and encodes a polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 44.5 kDa. The encoded protein exhibits a considerable degree of amino acid sequence similarity to all the other known G protein alpha subunits. A putative TATA sequence (ATATGA), a potential CAAT box sequence (AGCAATAC), and a cis-acting element, CCACGTGG (ABRE), known to be involved in ABA induction are found in the promoter region. The RGA1 protein contains all the consensus regions of G protein alpha subunits except the cysteine residue near the C-terminus for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. The RGA1 polypeptide expressed in Escherichia coli was, however, ADP-ribosylated by 10 microM [adenylate-32P] NAD and activated cholera toxin. Southern analysis indicates that there are no other genes similar to the RGA1 gene in the rice genome. Northern analysis reveals that the RGA1 mRNA is 1.85 kb long and expressed in vegetative tissues, including leaves and roots, and that its expression is regulated by light.
15292215	A novel NADPH thioredoxin reductase, localized in the chloroplast, which deficiency causes hypersensitivity to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2004	J Biol Chem	Plants contain three thioredoxin systems. Chloroplast thioredoxins are reduced by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, whereas the cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxins are reduced by NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR). There is high similarity among NTRs from plants, lower eukaryotes, and bacteria, which are different from mammal NTR. Here we describe the OsNTRC gene from rice encoding a novel NTR with a thioredoxin-like domain at the C terminus, hence, a putative NTR/thioredoxin system in a single polypeptide. Orthologous genes were found in other plants and cyanobacteria, but not in bacteria, yeast, or mammals. Full-length OsNTRC and constructs with truncated NTR and thioredoxin domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged polypeptides, and a polyclonal antibody specifically cross-reacting with the OsNTRC enzyme was raised. An in vitro activity assay showed that OsNTRC is a bifunctional enzyme with both NTR and thioredoxin activity but is not an NTR/thioredoxin system. Although the OsNTRC gene was expressed in roots and shoots of rice seedlings, the protein was exclusively found in shoots and mature leaves. Moreover, fractionation experiments showed that OsNTRC is localized to the chloroplast. An Arabidopsis NTRC knock-out mutant showed growth inhibition and hypersensitivity to methyl viologen, drought, and salt stress. These results suggest that the NTRC gene is involved in plant protection against oxidative stress.
9099854	Structure of the rice glutaredoxin (thioltransferase) gene.	1997	Gene	We have isolated the gene encoding a glutaredoxin in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of about a 4.2 kb long. The cloned gene (gRASC8) was found to contain four exons interrupted by three introns. The first exon begins the ATG translation start codon and the four exons code for a protein composed of 112 amino acids. The tetrapeptide -Cys-Pro-Phe-Cys- [-Cys-Pro-Phe(Tyr)-Cys-] which constitutes an active site of Escherichia coli and mammalian glutaredoxins, was conserved. The nt sequence contained consensus TATA and CAAT boxes, and two polyadenylation signals. Southern blot analysis of rice genomic DNA suggests that there are two copies of the glutaredoxin genes in rice.
15215503	A novel interaction between calreticulin and ubiquitin-like nuclear protein in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Calreticulin (CRT), a major Ca2+ -sequestering protein, has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions such as Ca2+ storage, signaling and chaperone activity within the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. To investigate the biological role of CRT in rice, 21 partial cDNAs, encoding proteins that interacted with rice CRT in a yeast two-hybrid interaction-cloning system, were characterized and the nucleotide sequences were found to be identical to each other. A full-length cDNA of 3.5 kb, obtained from rice genomic sequence data and 5' RACE, codes for a novel protein of 966 amino acid residues and was designated as CRTintP (CRT interacting protein). Primary sequence analysis of CRTintP showed no sequence homology with the known functional proteins; however, a potential ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminal together with a putative leucine zipper, a nuclear localization signal and several sites for serine/threonine kinases were evident. Cellular localization of CRTintP demonstrated its role in directing green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells. Northern and immunoblot analysis showed increased expression of CRT and CRTintP in response to cold stress. Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-CRT antibodies confirmed the existence of the CRT-CRTintP complex in vivo in the stressed leaf tissue, suggesting their potential role in regulating stress response.
7568110	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of expansins--a highly conserved, multigene family of proteins that mediate cell wall extension in plants.	1995	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Expansins are unusual proteins discovered by virtue of their ability to mediate cell wall extension in plants. We identified cDNA clones for two cucumber expansins on the basis of peptide sequences of proteins purified from cucumber hypocotyls. The expansin cDNAs encode related proteins with signal peptides predicted to direct protein secretion to the cell wall. Northern blot analysis showed moderate transcript abundance in the growing region of the hypocotyl and no detectable transcripts in the nongrowing region. Rice and Arabidopsis expansin cDNAs were identified from collections of anonymous cDNAs (expressed sequence tags). Sequence comparisons indicate at least four distinct expansin cDNAs in rice and at least six in Arabidopsis. Expansins are highly conserved in size and sequence (60-87% amino acid sequence identity and 75-95% similarity between any pairwise comparison), and phylogenetic trees indicate that this multigene family formed before the evolutionary divergence of monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Sequence and motif analyses show no similarities to known functional domains that might account for expansin action on wall extension. A series of highly conserved tryptophans may function in expansin binding to cellulose or other glycans. The high conservation of this multigene family indicates that the mechanism by which expansins promote wall extensin tolerates little variation in protein structure.
14640074	Cloning and characterization of a novel Hsp100/Clp gene (osClpD) from Oryza sativa.	2003	DNA Seq	A novel osClpD gene, encoding a highly conservative ClpD subfamily member, was first isolated and characterized from Oryza sativa. The full-length cDNA of osClpD gene was 3140 bp and contained a 2884 bp open reading frame encoding a 938 amino acid protein. The phylogenetic tree and blast search showed that OSClpD belonged to the ClpD subfamily of the Hsp100/Clp family, and contained all protein motifs characteristic for the ClpD subfamily of Hsp100/Clp proteins. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis proved that it was inducible by water deficit and temperature stress in vegetative tissues.
2016064	Rapid isolation of a rice waxy sequence: a simple PCR method for the analysis of recombinant plasmids from intact Escherichia coli cells.	1991	Gene	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an efficient method for obtaining a desired nt sequence if both required primers can hybridize to the target DNA molecule specifically. A rapid and simple PCR-based method for analyzing plasmids using intact cells was established. An attempt to target a rice waxy sequence by PCR using homologous primers was also carried out. In three cases, specific fragments were amplified and their nucleotide sequences were determined. However, the cloned rice waxy gene contained base substitution mutations. The cumulative frequency of mutation after 30 polymerization cycles was estimated to be one in 500 bp.
15356321	ARC3, a chloroplast division factor, is a chimera of prokaryotic FtsZ and part of eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	The arc3 (accumulation and replication of chloroplast) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana has a small number of abnormally large chloroplasts in the cell, suggesting that chloroplast division is arrested in the mutant and ARC3 has an important role in the initiation of chloroplast division. To elucidate the role of ARC3, first we identified the ARC3 gene, and determined the location of ARC3 protein during chloroplast division because the localization and spatial orientation of such division factors are vital for correct chloroplast division. Sequencing analysis showed that ARC3 was a fusion of the prokaryotic FtsZ and part of the eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) genes. The PIP5K-homologous region of ARC3 had no catalytic domain but a membrane-occupation-and-recognition-nexus (MORN) repeat motif. Immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting analysis and in vitro chloroplast import and protease protection assays revealed that ARC3 protein was soluble, and located on the outer surface of the chloroplast in a ring-like structure at the early stage of chloroplast division. Prokaryotes have one FtsZ as a gene for division but have no ARC3 counterparts, the chimera of FtsZ and PIP5K, suggesting that the ARC3 gene might have been generated from FtsZ as another division factor during the evolution of chloroplast by endosymbiosis.
16051676	LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice low-temperature-induced lip19 gene encodes a 148-amino-acid basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, termed LIP19. In this study we characterized LIP19 and showed that it lacks the usual ability of bZIP proteins to homodimerize and to bind DNA, as does the Fos protein in mammals. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the cDNA clones whose products interact with LIP19 were screened. This search revealed a clone termed OsOBF1 (Oryza sativa OBF1) that encodes a new bZIP protein (OsOBF1). This protein forms a homodimer and binds to the hexamer motif sequence (5'-ACGTCA-3'). The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta. LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence. Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical. Based upon the presented data, we propose a model describing the low-temperature signal switching mediated by LIP19 in rice.

10571178	A novel class of eukaryotic zinc-binding proteins is required for disease resistance signaling in barley and development in C. elegans.	1999	Cell	Barley Rar1 is a convergence point in the signaling of resistance to powdery mildew, triggered by multiple race-specific resistance (R) genes. Rar1 is shown to function upstream of H2O2 accumulation in attacked host cells, which precedes localized host cell death. We isolated Rar1 by map-based cloning. The sequence of the deduced 25.5 kDa protein reveals two copies of a 60-amino acid domain, CHORD, conserved in tandem organization in protozoa, plants, and metazoa. CHORD defines a novel eukaryotic Zn2+-binding domain. Silencing of the C. elegans CHORD-containing gene, chp, results in semisterility and embryo lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wild-type gene in nematode development. Our findings indicate that plant R genes have recruited a fundamental cellular control element for signaling of disease resistance and cell death.
9678973	Cloning of a cDNA encoding an importin-alpha and down-regulation of the gene by light in rice leaves.	1998	Gene	The import of nuclear proteins into nuclei begins with recognition of nuclear localization signal-harboring proteins and binding to a nuclear pore targeting complex. A cDNA for an importin-alpha protein, a subunit of the complex, was isolated from rice plants. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA exhibited a high homology to those of importin-alpha proteins from many organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human, mouse, Xenopus laevis and Drosophila melanogaster. Down-regulation of the transcription by light was shown in the leaves of light- and dark-grown seedlings by RNA blot analysis. The down-regulation was specific to leaves, whereas no light effect was observed in root tissues or calli, in which higher levels of the transcript were detected.
1731968	A novel cereal storage protein: molecular genetics of the 19 kDa globulin of rice.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	A lambda gt11 cDNA library, constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from immature rice seed endosperm, was screened with affinity-purified antibodies against the rice storage protein called alpha-globulin (previously), or the 19 kDa globulin (our term). A positive clone was isolated and sequenced and shown to encode a 21 kDa precursor for the 19 kDa globulin, based on the identity of portions of the inferred amino acid sequence and the sequence of three cyanogen bromide peptides of the 19 kDa globulin. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting using the cDNA clone probe revealed one hybridizing band in Eco RI, Hind III, and Bam HI digests. This strongly suggests that the 19 kDa globulin is encoded by a single-copy gene. Because of its single-copy nature and its abundance of Arg and lack of Lys, the 19 kDa rice globulin appears to be a particularly attractive target for genetically engineering increased Lys content in rice seeds.
2251127	Nucleotide sequence of two rice prolamin cDNAs.	1990	Nucleic Acids Res	
1391776	cDNA cloning and gene expression of the major prolamins of rice.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	A full-length cDNA (pS 18) encoding the 16 kDa rice prolamin composed of 158 amino acids was sequenced. Analysis of N-terminal amino acid sequence of a major rice prolamin indicated that an 18 amino acid signal peptide was removed from 16 kDa precursor prolamin to form the 14 kDa prolamin during seed development. Synthesis of the 16 kDa precursor prolamin began around 8 days after flowering (DAF), increased remarkably at 8-11 DAF and gradually reached maximum levels with the maturation of rice seeds.
1731976	Structure of a rice beta-glucanase gene regulated by ethylene, cytokinin, wounding, salicylic acid and fungal elicitors.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	A rice beta-glucanase gene was sequenced and its expression analyzed at the level of mRNA accumulation. This gene (Gns1) is expressed at relatively low levels in germinating seeds, shoots, leaves, panicles and callus, but it is expressed at higher levels in roots. Expression in the roots appears to be constitutive. Shoots express Gns1 at much higher levels when treated with ethylene, cytokinin, salicylic acid, and fungal elicitors derived from the pathogen Sclerotium oryzae or from the non-pathogen Saccharomyces cereviseae. Shoots also express Gns1 at higher levels in response to wounding. Expression in the shoots is not significantly affected by auxin, gibberellic acid or abscisic acid. The beta-glucanase shows 82% amino acid similarity to the barley 1,3;1,4-beta-D-glucanases, and from hybridization studies it is the beta-glucanase gene in the rice genome closest to the barley 1,3;1,4-beta-glucanase EI gene. The mature peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 32 kDa. The gene has a large 3145 bp intron in the codon for the 25th amino acid of the signal peptide. The gene exhibits a very strong codon bias of 99% G + C in the third position of the codon in the mature peptide coding region, but only 61% G + C in the signal peptide region.
12856948	A maize defense-inducible gene is a major facilitator superfamily member related to bacterial multidrug resistance efflux antiporters.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	A defense-inducible maize gene was discovered through global mRNA profiling analysis. Its mRNA expression is induced by pathogens and defense-related conditions in various tissues involving both resistant and susceptible interactions. These include Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Cochliobolus carbonum infection, ultraviolet light treatment, the Les9 disease lesion mimic background, and plant tissues engineered to express flavonoids or the avirulence gene avrRxv. The gene was named Zm-mfs1 after it was found to encode a protein related to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of intregral membrane permeases. It is most closely related to the bacterial multidrug efflux protein family, typified by the Escherichia coli TetA, which are proton motive force antiporters that export antimicrobial drugs and other compounds, but which can be also involved in potassium export/proton import or potassium re-uptake. Other related plant gene sequences in maize, rice, and Arabidopsis were identified, three of which are introduced here. Among this new plant MFS subfamily, the characteristic MFS motif in cytoplasmic TM2-TM3 loop, and the antiporter family motif in transmembrane domain TM5 are both conserved, however the TM7 and the cytoplasmic TM8-TM9 loop are divergent from those of the bacterial multidrug transporters. We hypothesize that Zm-Mfs1 is a prototype of a new class of plant defense-related proteins that could be involved in either of three nonexclusive roles: (1) export of antimicrobial compounds produced by plant pathogens; (2) export of plant-generated antimicrobial compounds; and (3) potassium export and/or re-uptake, as can occur in plant defense reactions.
14638937	Genetic engineering of the glyoxalase pathway in tobacco leads to enhanced salinity tolerance.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The glyoxalase pathway involving glyoxalase I (gly I) and glyoxalase II (gly II) enzymes is required for glutathione-based detoxification of methylglyoxal. We had earlier indicated the potential of gly I as a probable candidate gene in conferring salinity tolerance. We report here that overexpression of gly I+II together confers improved salinity tolerance, thus offering another effective strategy for manipulating stress tolerance in crop plants. We have overexpressed the gly II gene either alone in untransformed plants or with gly I transgenic background. Both types of these transgenic plants stably expressed the foreign protein, and the enzyme activity was also higher. Compared with nontransformants, several independent gly II transgenic lines showed improved capability for tolerating exposure to high methylglyoxal and NaCl concentration and were able to grow, flower, and set normal viable seeds under continuous salinity stress conditions. Importantly, the double transgenic lines always showed a better response than either of the single gene-transformed lines and WT plants under salinity stress. Ionic measurements revealed higher accumulation of Na+ and K+ in old leaves and negligible accumulation of Na+ in seeds of transgenic lines as compared with the WT plants. Comparison of various growth parameters and seed production demonstrated that there is hardly any yield penalty in the double transgenics under nonstress conditions and that these plants suffered only 5% loss in total productivity when grown in 200 mM NaCl. These findings establish the potential of manipulation of the glyoxalase pathway for increased salinity tolerance without affecting yield in crop plants.
16429261	Expression enhancement of a rice polyubiquitin gene promoter.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	An 808 bp promoter from a rice polyubiquitin gene, rubi3, has been isolated. The rubi3 gene contained an open reading frame of 1,140 bp encoding a pentameric polyubiquitin arranged as five tandem, head-to-tail repeats of 76 aa. The 1,140 bp 5' UTR intron of the gene enhanced its promoter activity in transient expression assays by 20-fold. Translational fusion of the GUS reporter gene to the coding sequence of the ubiquitin monomer enhanced GUS enzyme activity in transient expression assays by 4.3-fold over the construct containing the original rubi3 promoter (including the 5' UTR intron) construct. The enhancing effect residing in the ubiquitin monomer coding sequence has been narrowed down to the first 9 nt coding for the first three amino acid residues of the ubiquitin protein. Mutagenesis at the third nucleotide of this 9 nt sequence still maintains the enhancing effect, but leads to translation of the native GUS protein rather than a fusion protein. The resultant 5' regulatory sequence, consisting of the rubi3 promoter, 5' UTR exon and intron, and the mutated first 9 nt coding sequence, has an activity nearly 90-fold greater than the rubi3 promoter only (without the 5' UTR intron), and 2.2-fold greater than the maize Ubi1 gene promoter (including its 5' UTR intron). The newly created expression vector is expected to enhance transgene expression in monocot plants. Considering the high conservation of the polyubiquitin gene structure in higher plants, the observed enhancement in gene expression may apply to 5' regulatory sequences of other plant polyubiquitin genes.
11752383	The Arabidopsis HUELLENLOS gene, which is essential for normal ovule development, encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein.	2001	Plant Cell	The HUELLENLOS (HLL) gene participates in patterning and growth of the Arabidopsis ovule. We have isolated the HLL gene and shown that it encodes a protein homologous to the L14 proteins of eubacterial ribosomes. The Arabidopsis genome also includes a highly similar gene, HUELLENLOS PARALOG (HLP), and genes for both cytosolic (L23) and chloroplast ribosome L14 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis shows that HLL and HLP differ significantly from these other two classes of such proteins. HLL and HLP fusions to green fluorescent protein were localized to mitochondria. Ectopic expression of HLP complemented the hll mutant, indicating that HLP and HLL share redundant functions. We conclude that HLL and HLP encode L14 subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes. HLL mRNA was at significantly higher levels than HLP mRNA in pistils, with the opposite pattern in leaves. This differential expression can explain the confinement of effects of hll mutations to gynoecia and ovules. Our elucidation of the nature of HLL shows that metabolic defects can have specific effects on developmental patterning.
16244905	Structural, functional, and phylogenetic characterization of a large CBF gene family in barley.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	CBFs are key regulators in the Arabidopsis cold signaling pathway. We used Hordeum vulgare (barley), an important crop and a diploid Triticeae model, to characterize the CBF family from a low temperature tolerant cereal. We report that barley contains a large CBF family consisting of at least 20 genes (HvCBFs) comprising three multigene phylogenetic groupings designated the HvCBF1-, HvCBF3-, and HvCBF4-subgroups. For the HvCBF1- and HvCBF3-subgroups, there are comparable levels of phylogenetic diversity among rice, a cold-sensitive cereal, and the cold-hardy Triticeae. For the HvCBF4-subgroup, while similar diversity levels are observed in the Triticeae, only a single ancestral rice member was identified. The barley CBFs share many functional characteristics with dicot CBFs, including a general primary domain structure, transcript accumulation in response to cold, specific binding to the CRT motif, and the capacity to induce cor gene expression when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis. Individual HvCBF genes differed in response to abiotic stress types and in the response time frame, suggesting different sets of HvCBF genes are employed relative to particular stresses. HvCBFs specifically bound monocot and dicot cor gene CRT elements in vitro under both warm and cold conditions; however, binding of HvCBF4-subgroup members was cold dependent. The temperature-independent HvCBFs activated cor gene expression at warm temperatures in transgenic Arabidopsis, while the cold-dependent HvCBF4-subgroup members of three Triticeae species did not. These results suggest that in the Triticeae - as in Arabidopsis - members of the CBF gene family function as fundamental components of the winter hardiness regulon.
8049375	Tobacco cytochrome b5: cDNA isolation, expression analysis and in vitro protein targeting.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	A full-length clone encoding cytochrome b5 has been isolated from a tobacco leaf cDNA library in lambda gt11 by PCR using degenerate primers. This cDNA encodes a protein of 139 residues which exhibits a high degree of homology to other cytochrome b5s, the message for which is expressed predominantly in developing seeds and in pigmented flower tissue. In the developing tobacco seed the mRNA is abundant at very early stages (< 10 days after flowering). Southern analysis indicated that more than one gene encodes cytochrome b5 in the tobacco genome. In vitro transcription and translation studies of the cDNA indicated that the protein inserts into the ER membrane by a non-SRP-mediated pathway and that the C-terminus of the protein is required for targeting and insertion.

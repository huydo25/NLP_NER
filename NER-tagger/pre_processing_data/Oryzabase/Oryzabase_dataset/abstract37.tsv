25002488	Mutation of a major CG methylase in rice causes genome-wide hypomethylation, dysregulated genome expression, and seedling lethality.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cytosine methylation at CG sites ((m)CG) plays critical roles in development, epigenetic inheritance, and genome stability in mammals and plants. In the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, methyltransferase 1 (MET1), a principal CG methylase, functions to maintain (m)CG during DNA replication, with its null mutation resulting in global hypomethylation and pleiotropic developmental defects. Null mutation of a critical CG methylase has not been characterized at a whole-genome level in other higher eukaryotes, leaving the generality of the Arabidopsis findings largely speculative. Rice is a model plant of monocots, to which many of our important crops belong. Here we have characterized a null mutant of OsMet1-2, the major CG methylase in rice. We found that seeds homozygous for OsMet1-2 gene mutation (OsMET1-2(-/-)), which directly segregated from normal heterozygote plants (OsMET1-2(+/-)), were seriously maldeveloped, and all germinated seedlings underwent swift necrotic death. Compared with wild type, genome-wide loss of (m)CG occurred in the mutant methylome, which was accompanied by a plethora of quantitative molecular phenotypes including dysregulated expression of diverse protein-coding genes, activation and repression of transposable elements, and altered small RNA profiles. Our results have revealed conservation but also distinct functional differences in CG methylases between rice and Arabidopsis.
25064006	The genome sequence of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and evidence for independent domestication.	2014	Nat Genet	The cultivation of rice in Africa dates back more than 3,000 years. Interestingly, African rice is not of the same origin as Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) but rather is an entirely different species (i.e., Oryza glaberrima Steud.). Here we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the O. glaberrima genome and detailed analyses of its evolutionary history of domestication and selection. Population genomics analyses of 20 O. glaberrima and 94 Oryza barthii accessions support the hypothesis that O. glaberrima was domesticated in a single region along the Niger river as opposed to noncentric domestication events across Africa. We detected evidence for artificial selection at a genome-wide scale, as well as with a set of O. glaberrima genes orthologous to O. sativa genes that are known to be associated with domestication, thus indicating convergent yet independent selection of a common set of genes during two geographically and culturally distinct domestication processes.
25082857	Integrated syntenic and phylogenomic analyses reveal an ancient genome duplication in monocots.	2014	Plant Cell	Unraveling widespread polyploidy events throughout plant evolution is a necessity for inferring the impacts of whole-genome duplication (WGD) on speciation, functional innovations, and to guide identification of true orthologs in divergent taxa. Here, we employed an integrated syntenic and phylogenomic analyses to reveal an ancient WGD that shaped the genomes of all commelinid monocots, including grasses, bromeliads, bananas (Musa acuminata), ginger, palms, and other plants of fundamental, agricultural, and/or horticultural interest. First, comprehensive phylogenomic analyses revealed 1421 putative gene families that retained ancient duplication shared by Musa (Zingiberales) and grass (Poales) genomes, indicating an ancient WGD in monocots. Intergenomic synteny blocks of Musa and Oryza were investigated, and 30 blocks were shown to be duplicated before Musa-Oryza divergence an estimated 120 to 150 million years ago. Synteny comparisons of four monocot (rice [Oryza sativa], sorghum [Sorghum bicolor], banana, and oil palm [Elaeis guineensis]) and two eudicot (grape [Vitis vinifera] and sacred lotus [Nelumbo nucifera]) genomes also support this additional WGD in monocots, herein called Tau (τ). Integrating synteny and phylogenomic comparisons achieves better resolution of ancient polyploidy events than either approach individually, a principle that is exemplified in the disambiguation of a WGD series of rho (ρ)-sigma (σ)-tau (τ) in the grass lineages that echoes the alpha (α)-beta (β)-gamma (γ) series previously revealed in the Arabidopsis thaliana lineage.
25014137	Bioinformatics analysis of plant orthologous introns: identification of an intronic tRNA-like sequence.	2014	Gene	Orthologous introns have identical positions relative to the coding sequence in orthologous genes of different species. By analyzing the complete genomes of five plants we generated a database of 40,512 orthologous intron groups of dicotyledonous plants, 28,519 orthologous intron groups of angiosperms, and 15,726 of land plants (moss and angiosperms). Multiple sequence alignments of each orthologous intron group were obtained using the Mafft algorithm. The number of conserved regions in plant introns appeared to be hundreds of times fewer than that in mammals or vertebrates. Approximately three quarters of conserved intronic regions among angiosperms and dicots, in particular, correspond to alternatively-spliced exonic sequences. We registered only a handful of conserved intronic ncRNAs of flowering plants. However, the most evolutionarily conserved intronic region, which is ubiquitous for all plants examined in this study, including moss, possessed multiple structural features of tRNAs, which caused us to classify it as a putative tRNA-like ncRNA. Intronic sequences encoding tRNA-like structures are not unique to plants. Bioinformatics examination of the presence of tRNA inside introns revealed an unusually long-term association of four glycine tRNAs inside the Vac14 gene of fish, amniotes, and mammals.
25012190	The structure of the catalytic domain of a plant cellulose synthase and its assembly into dimers.	2014	Plant Cell	Cellulose microfibrils are para-crystalline arrays of several dozen linear (1→4)-β-d-glucan chains synthesized at the surface of the cell membrane by large, multimeric complexes of synthase proteins. Recombinant catalytic domains of rice (Oryza sativa) CesA8 cellulose synthase form dimers reversibly as the fundamental scaffold units of architecture in the synthase complex. Specificity of binding to UDP and UDP-Glc indicates a properly folded protein, and binding kinetics indicate that each monomer independently synthesizes single glucan chains of cellulose, i.e., two chains per dimer pair. In contrast to structure modeling predictions, solution x-ray scattering studies demonstrate that the monomer is a two-domain, elongated structure, with the smaller domain coupling two monomers into a dimer. The catalytic core of the monomer is accommodated only near its center, with the plant-specific sequences occupying the small domain and an extension distal to the catalytic domain. This configuration is in stark contrast to the domain organization obtained in predicted structures of plant CesA. The arrangement of the catalytic domain within the CesA monomer and dimer provides a foundation for constructing structural models of the synthase complex and defining the relationship between the rosette structure and the cellulose microfibrils they synthesize.
25038275	Identification of 23 novel conserved microRNAs in three rice cultivars.	2014	Gene	Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles as modulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Previous studies have shown that high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool for the identification of miRNAs, and it is believed that many more miRNAs remain to be discovered. Here, we found 23 novel conserved miRNAs from three rice cultivars by high-throughput sequencing and further identified these through subsequent cloning and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Eight of these novel miRNAs were detected with significant signals in the three rice cultivars by northern blotting assays. The quantitative analysis of their expression profiles showed that most of these miRNAs were perfectly or imperfectly negatively correlated with their target genes, which suggests that these miRNAs may play important roles during rice development. This is the first genome-wide investigation of miRNAs from different rice cultivars, and the data obtained expand the known rice miRNA inventory and provide further information about the regulatory roles played by miRNAs in rice development.
25028496	Strigolactones regulate rice tiller angle by attenuating shoot gravitropism through inhibiting auxin biosynthesis.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Tiller angle, a key agronomic trait for achieving ideal plant architecture and increasing grain yield, is regulated mainly by shoot gravitropism. Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that are essential for shoot branching/rice tillering and have further biological functions as yet undetermined. Through screening for suppressors of lazy1 (sols), a classic rice mutant exhibiting large tiller angle and defective shoot gravitropism, we identified multiple SOLS that are involved in the SL biosynthetic or signaling pathway. We show that SL biosynthetic or signaling mutants can rescue the spreading phenotype of lazy1 (la1) and that SLs can inhibit auxin biosynthesis and attenuate rice shoot gravitropism, mainly by decreasing the local indoleacetic acid content. Although both SLs and LA1 are negative regulators of polar auxin transport, SLs do not alter the lateral auxin transport of shoot base, unlike LA1, which is a positive regulator of lateral auxin transport in rice. Genetic evidence demonstrates that SLs and LA1 participate in regulating shoot gravitropism and tiller angle in distinct genetic pathways. In addition, the SL-mediated shoot gravitropism is conserved in Arabidopsis. Our results disclose a new role of SLs and shed light on a previously unidentified mechanism underlying shoot gravitropism. Our study indicates that SLs could be considered as an important tool to achieve ideal plant architecture in the future.
25096783	The Os-AKT1 channel is critical for K+ uptake in rice roots and is modulated by the rice CBL1-CIPK23 complex.	2014	Plant Cell	Potassium (K(+)) is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Plants absorb K(+) ions from the environment via root cell K(+) channels and/or transporters. In this study, the Shaker K(+) channel Os-AKT1 was characterized for its function in K(+) uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, and its regulation by Os-CBL1 (Calcineurin B-Like protein1) and Os-CIPK23 (CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase23) was investigated. As an inward K(+) channel, Os-AKT1 could carry out K(+) uptake and rescue the low-K(+)-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana akt1 mutant plants. Rice Os-akt1 mutant plants showed decreased K(+) uptake and displayed an obvious low-K(+)-sensitive phenotype. Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K(+) content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development. Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice. The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake. A phenotype test confirmed that Os-CIPK23 RNAi lines exhibited similar K(+)-deficient symptoms as the Os-akt1 mutant under low K(+) conditions. These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
25106855	The rice WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes are involved in reproductive organ development, hormone signaling and abiotic stress response.	2014	Gene	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes are important transcription regulators participated in plant development processes. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome encodes at least 13 WOX members. In this study, a systematic microarray-based gene expression profiling of eleven WOX genes was performed for the whole life cycle of rice at 16 different tissues/organs of MH63 (rice indica cultivar), which included eight reproductive organs and eight vegetative tissues. The results demonstrated that four genes (OsWUS, OsNS1/OsNS2, OsWOX3 and OsWOX9A) were specifically expressed in panicle and endosperm development, and six genes (OsWOX5, OsWOX9B, OsWOX9D, OsWOX11, OsWOX12A and OsWOX12B) were preferentially expressed in seeds (72h after imbibitions) during root emergence or growth. In situ hybridization analysis revealed differential transcript levels of OsWOX4, OsWOX5, OsWOX9A and OsWOX12B during panicle development and embryogenesis. Results of qRT-PCR showed that expression of four rice WOX genes (OsWOX5, OsWOX11, OsWOX12B and OsWOX12A) was up- or down-regulated by plant hormones (auxin, cytokinin and gibberellin). More interestingly, most WOX genes were responsive to abiotic stress stimuli of drought, salt and cold. The molecular studies presented here will further provide insight in understanding the functions of rice WOX gene family in rice development, hormone signaling, and abiotic stress response.
25178525	OsNF-YB1, a rice endosperm-specific gene, is essential for cell proliferation in endosperm development.	2014	Gene	Cell cycle regulators are crucial for normal endosperm development and seed size determination. However, how the cell cycle related genes regulate endosperm development remains unclear. In this study, we reported a rice Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) gene OsNF-YB1, which was also identified as an endosperm-specific gene. Transcriptional profiling and promoter analysis revealed that OsNF-YB1 was highly expressed at the early stages of rice endosperm development (5-7 DAP, days after pollination). Repression of OsNF-YB1 resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm. Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants. Taken together, these results suggested that the endosperm-specific gene OsNF-YB1 might be a cell cycle regulator and played a role in maintaining the endosperm cell proliferation.
25114224	Predicting hybrid performance in rice using genomic best linear unbiased prediction.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Genomic selection is an upgrading form of marker-assisted selection for quantitative traits, and it differs from the traditional marker-assisted selection in that markers in the entire genome are used to predict genetic values and the QTL detection step is skipped. Genomic selection holds the promise to be more efficient than the traditional marker-assisted selection for traits controlled by polygenes. Genomic selection for pure breed improvement is based on marker information and thus leads to cost-saving due to early selection before phenotypes are measured. When applied to hybrid breeding, genomic selection is anticipated to be even more efficient because genotypes of hybrids are predetermined by their inbred parents. Hybrid breeding has been an important tool to increase crop productivity. Here we proposed and applied an advanced method to predict hybrid performance, in which a subset of all potential hybrids is used as a training sample to predict trait values of all potential hybrids. The method is called genomic best linear unbiased prediction. The technology applied to hybrids is called genomic hybrid breeding. We used 278 randomly selected hybrids derived from 210 recombinant inbred lines of rice as a training sample and predicted all 21,945 potential hybrids. The average yield of top 100 selection shows a 16% increase compared with the average yield of all potential hybrids. The new strategy of marker-guided prediction of hybrid yields serves as a proof of concept for a new technology that may potentially revolutionize hybrid breeding.
24781994	A novel synthetic Cry1Ab gene resists rice insect pests.	2014	Genet Mol Res	A few insect control genes of Bacillus thuringiensis have been modified successfully to increase the expression in plants by replacing rare codons, increasing GC content, and avoiding the DNA elements that could cause premature transcription termination, mRNA instability, and potential methylation. However, the modification process was intricate and often confused researchers. In this study, we adopted a simple method to modify Cry1Ab only by individually replacing its amino acid sequence with corresponding rice-preferred codons based on analysis of 92,188 coding DNA sequences. Unexpectedly, all elements of A+T richness, which terminate or destabilize transcription in plants, were avoided in the newly designed mCry1Ab. However, mCry1Ab had 2 notable features: less synonymous codons and high GC content. mCry1Ab only employed 22 of the 61 codons to encode protein and had an enhanced GC content of 65%. The increase in GC content caused abundant potential methylation signals to emerge in mCry1Ab. To test whether mCry1Ab could be expressed in rice, we transferred it into Oryza japonica variety Wanjing97. Insect bioassays revealed that transgenic plants harboring this gene driven by 2 promoters, CaMV35S and OsTSP I, were highly resistant to rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). Analysis of R0 to R2 generation plants indicated that the mCry1Ab was inherited stably by the progeny. Our study provided a simple modified method for expressing exogenous genes in rice and confirmed that less synonymous codons and high GC content do not affect transgene expression in rice.
24694754	An appropriate concentration of arginine is required for normal root growth in rice.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Plant roots play an important role in uptake of water and nutrients, support of above-ground part and environmental sensing, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the root development are poorly understood in rice. We found that a gene (OsASL1) encoding argininosuccinate lyase is involved in normal root development of rice. OsASL1 cleaves argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate reversibly, the last step in the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth. A detailed expression analysis revealed that 2 transcripts of OsASL1, OsASL1.1 and OsASL1.2, showed different expression patterns; OsASL1.1 was expressed in most organs throughout the whole growth period, whereas OsASL1.2 was mainly expressed in the roots. In contrast to plastid-localized OsASL1.1, OsASL1.2 was localized to the cytosol and nucleus. The short-root phenotype of the mutant was not rescued by exogenous addition of the sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, but rescued by an appropriate concentration of Arg. Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of OsASL1 and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice.
24686568	Salicylic acid antagonizes abscisic acid inhibition of shoot growth and cell cycle progression in rice.	2014	Sci Rep	We analysed effects of abscisic acid (ABA, a negative regulatory hormone), alone and in combination with positive or neutral hormones, including salicylic acid (SA), on rice growth and expression of cell cycle-related genes. ABA significantly inhibited shoot growth and induced expression of OsKRP4, OsKRP5, and OsKRP6. A yeast two-hybrid assay showed that OsKRP4, OsKRP5, and OsKRP6 interacted with OsCDKA;1 and/or OsCDKA;2. When SA was simultaneously supplied with ABA, the antagonistic effect of SA completely blocked ABA inhibition. SA also blocked ABA inhibition of DNA replication and thymidine incorporation in the shoot apical meristem. These results suggest that ABA arrests cell cycle progression by inducing expression of OsKRP4, OsKRP5, and OsKRP6, which inhibit the G1/S transition, and that SA antagonizes ABA by blocking expression of OsKRP genes.
24908504	Iron sensors and signals in response to iron deficiency.	2014	Plant Sci	The transcription of genes involved in iron acquisition in plants is induced under iron deficiency, but our understanding of iron sensors and signals remains limited. Iron Deficiency-responsive Element-binding Factor 1 (IDEF1) and Hemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene- and Zinc-finger proteins (HRZs)/BRUTUS (BTS) have recently emerged as candidate iron sensors because of their functions as potent regulators of iron deficiency responses and their iron-binding properties. IDEF1 is a central transcriptional regulator of graminaceous genes involved in iron uptake and utilization, predominantly during the early stages of iron deficiency. HRZs/BTS are E3 ubiquitin ligases and negative regulators of iron deficiency responses in both graminaceous and non-graminaceous plants. Rice OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are also potent regulators of iron accumulation. Characterizing these putative iron sensors also provides clues to understanding the nature of iron signals, which may involve ionized iron itself, other metals, oxygen, redox status, heme and iron-sulfur clusters, in addition to metabolites affected by iron deficiency. Systemic iron responses may also be regulated by phloem-mobile iron and its chelators such as nicotianamine. Iron sensors and signals will be identified by demonstration of signal transmission by IDEF1, HRZs/BTS, or unknown factors.
24840826	Genomewide survey and characterization of metacaspase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	J Genet	Metacaspases (MCs), which are cysteine-dependent proteases found in plants, fungi, and protozoa, may be involved in programmed cell death processes, being distant relatives of metazoan caspases. In this study, we analysed the structures, phylogenetic relationship, genome localizations, expression patterns and domestic selections of eight MC genes identified in rice (OsMC). Alignment analysis of the corresponding protein sequences suggested OsMC proteins can be classified into two subtypes. The expression profiles of eight OsMC genes were analysed in 27 tissues covering the whole life cycle of rice. There are four OsMC genes uniquely expressed in mature tissues, indicating that these genes might play certain roles in senescence. Under abiotic and biotic stresses, four OsMC genes were expressed with treatments of one or more of Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) infected, pest damaged, cold stress and drought stress, indicating they might be involved in plant defense. In addition, gene trees and genetic diversity (π) were performed to measure whether candidate genes were selected during rice domestication. The results suggested that all the type I genes could not be domestication genes. However, two of five type II OsMC genes showed strong evidence for selective sweep, suggesting that these genes might be involved in cultivated rice domestication. These results provide a foundation for future functional genomic studies of this family in rice.
24743650	Identification and characterization of ABA receptors in Oryza sativa.	2014	PLoS One	Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential phytohormone that regulates plant stress responses. ABA receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPYLs) have been extensively investigated by structural, biochemical, and in vivo studies. In contrast, relatively little is known about the ABA signal transduction cascade in rice. Besides, the diversities of AtPYLs manifest that the information accumulated in Arabidopsis cannot be simply adapted to rice. Thus, studies on rice ABA receptors are compulsory. By taking a bioinformatic approach, we identified twelve ABA receptor orthologs in Oryza sativa (japonica cultivar-group) (OsPYLs), named OsPYL1-12. We have successfully expressed and purified OsPYL1-3, 6 and 10-12 to homogeneity, tested the inhibitory effects on PP2C in Oryza sativa (OsPP2C), and measured their oligomerization states. OsPYL1-3 mainly exhibit as dimers and require ABA to inhibit PP2C's activity. On the contrary, OsPYL6 retains in the monomer-dimer equilibrium state and OsPYL10-11 largely exist as monomers, and they all display an ABA-independent phosphatase inhibition manner. Interestingly, although OsPYL12 seems to be a dimer, it abrogates the phosphatase activity of PP2Cs in the absence of ABA. Toward a further understanding of OsPYLs on the ABA binding and PP2C inhibition, we determined the crystal structure of ABA-OsPYL2-OsPP2C06 complex. The bioinformatic, biochemical and structural analysis of ABA receptors in rice provide important foundations for designing rational ABA-analogues and breeding the stress-resistant rice for commercial agriculture.
24790113	RAN1 is involved in plant cold resistance and development in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	J Exp Bot	Of the diverse abiotic stresses, low temperature is one of the major limiting factors that lead to a series of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes in plants. Ran, an evolutionarily conserved small G-protein family, has been shown to be essential for the nuclear translocation of proteins. It also mediates the regulation of cell cycle progression in mammalian cells. However, little is known about Ran function in rice (Oryza sativa). We report here that Ran gene OsRAN1 is essential for the molecular improvement of rice for cold tolerance. Ran also affects plant morphogenesis in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. OsRAN1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues with the highest expression in the spike. The levels of mRNA encoding OsRAN1 were greatly increased by cold and indoleacetic acid treatment rather than by addition of salt and polyethylene glycol. Further, OsRAN1 overexpression in Arabidopsis increased tiller number, and altered root development. OsRAN1 overexpression in rice improves cold tolerance. The levels of cellular free Pro and sugar levels were highly increased in transgenic plants under cold stress. Under cold stress, OsRAN1 maintained cell division and cell cycle progression, and also promoted the formation of an intact nuclear envelope. The results suggest that OsRAN1 protein plays an important role in the regulation of cellular mitosis and the auxin signalling pathway.
24809003	Identification of a Geranylgeranyl reductase gene for chlorophyll synthesis in rice.	2014	Springerplus	Geranylgeranyl reductase (CHL P) catalyzes the reduction of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to phytyl diphosphate, and provides phytol for both Chlorophyll (Chl) and tocopherol synthesis. In this study, we isolated a yellow-green leaf mutant, 502ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited reduced level of Chls, arrested development of chloroplasts, and retarded growth rate. The phenotype of the 502ys mutant was controlled by by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the long arm of rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning of the mutant resulted in the identification of an OsChl P gene (LOC_Os02g51080). In the 502ys mutant, a single base pair mutation was detected at residue 1279 in DNA sequence of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change (Gly-206 to Ser) in the encoded protein. HPLC analysis of Chls indicated that the majority of Chl molecules are conjugated with an unsaturated geranylgeraniol side chain, in addition to small amount of normal Chls in the mutant. Furthermore, the mutant phenotype was complemented by transformation with the wild-type gene. Therefore, this study has confirmed the 502ys mutant resulted from a single base pair mutation in OsChl P gene.
24738983	Subcellular localization of rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) indicates that OsACBP6::GFP is targeted to the peroxisomes.	2014	New Phytol	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) show conservation at the acyl-CoA-binding (ACB) domain which facilitates binding to acyl-CoA esters. In Arabidopsis thaliana, six ACBPs participate in development and stress responses. Rice (Oryza sativa) also contains six genes encoding ACBPs. We investigated differences in subcellular localization between monocot rice and eudicot A. thaliana ACBPs. The subcellular localization of the six OsACBPs was achieved via transient expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) epidermal cells, and stable transformation of A. thaliana. As plant ACBPs had not been reported in the peroxisomes, OsACBP6::GFP localization was confirmed by transient expression in rice sheath cells. The function of OsACBP6 was investigated by overexpressing 35S::OsACBP6 in the peroxisomal abc transporter1 (pxa1) mutant defective in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. As predicted, OsACBP1::GFP and OsACBP2::GFP were localized to the cytosol, and OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, OsACBP3::GFP displayed subcellular multi-localization while OsACBP6::GFP was localized to the peroxisomes. 35S::OsACBP6-OE/pxa1 lines showed recovery in indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) peroxisomal β-oxidation, wound-induced VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN1 (VSP1) expression and jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation. These findings indicate a role for OsACBP6 in peroxisomal β-oxidation, and suggest that rice ACBPs are involved in lipid degradation in addition to lipid biosynthesis.
24723395	Retention of OsNMD3 in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	The ribosome is the basic machinery for translation, and biogenesis of ribosomes involves many coordinated events. However, knowledge about ribosomal dynamics in higher plants is very limited. This study chose a highly conserved trans-factor, the 60S ribosomal subunit nuclear export adaptor NMD3, to characterize the mechanism of ribosome biogenesis in the monocot plant Oryza sativa (rice). O. sativa NMD3 (OsNMD3) shares all the common motifs and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via CRM1/XPO1. A dominant negative form of OsNMD3 with a truncated nuclear localization sequence (OsNMD3(ΔNLS)) was retained in the cytoplasm, consequently interfering with the release of OsNMD3 from pre-60S particles and disturbing the assembly of ribosome subunits. Analyses of the transactivation activity and cellulose biosynthesis level revealed low protein synthesis efficiency in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants. Pharmaceutical treatments demonstrated structural alterations in ribosomes in the transgenic plants. Moreover, global expression profiles of the wild-type and transgenic plants were investigated using the Illumina RNA sequencing approach. These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of OsNMD3(ΔNLS) affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsNMD3 is important for ribosome assembly and the maintenance of normal protein synthesis efficiency.
24748046	Physcomitrella patens has kinase-LRR R gene homologs and interacting proteins.	2014	PLoS One	Plant disease resistance gene (R gene)-like sequences were screened from the Physcomitrella patens genome. We found 603 kinase-like, 475 Nucleotide Binding Site (NBS)-like and 8594 Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR)-like sequences by homology searching using the respective domains of PpC24 (Accession No. BAD38895), which is a candidate kinase-NBS-LRR (kinase-NL) type R-like gene, as a reference. The positions of these domains in the genome were compared and 17 kinase-NLs were predicted. We also found four TIR-NBS-LRR (TIR-NL) sequences with homology to Arabidopsis TIR-NL (NM_001125847), but three out of the four TIR-NLs had tetratricopeptide repeats or a zinc finger domain in their predicted C-terminus. We also searched for kinase-LRR (KLR) type sequences by homology with rice OsXa21 and Arabidopsis thaliana FLS2. As a result, 16 KLRs with similarity to OsXa21 were found. In phylogenetic analysis of these 16 KLRs, PpKLR36, PpKLR39, PpKLR40, and PpKLR43 formed a cluster with OsXa21. These four PpKLRs had deduced transmembrane domain sequences and expression of all four was confirmed. We also found 14 homologs of rice OsXB3, which is known to interact with OsXa21 and is involved in signal transduction. Protein-protein interaction was observed between the four PpKLRs and at least two of the XB3 homologs in Y2H analysis.
24687599	Oxygen deficit alleviates phosphate overaccumulation toxicity in OsPHR2 overexpression plants.	2014	J Plant Res	Overexpression of OsPHR2 increases phosphate (Pi) uptake and causes overaccumulation of Pi in rice plants, which is toxic to rice plants when they are grown in media with a sufficient Pi supply. The toxicity that results from OsPHR2 overexpression can be significantly relieved by growing the plants in a waterlogged paddy field. A comparison of the Pi uptake and growth status of OsPHR2-overexpression plants (PHR2-Oe plants) grown in paddy fields or in a laboratory setting in aerated or stagnant hydroponic conditions indicated that the oxygen limitation that is present in paddy fields and in stagnant rice culture solutions inhibits the Pi overaccumulation toxicity of PHR2-Oe plants by reducing their Pi uptake. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of Pi-starvation-induced (PSI) genes was induced by oxygen limitation in both wild-type and PHR2-Oe plants. The induction of PSI genes is the consequence of reducing the Pi concentration in stagnant plants. Thus, when evaluating the efficiency of Pi use in rice germplasm or transgenic materials under hydroponic conditions, the impact of the low oxygen condition that exists in waterlogged paddies should be considered.
24728072	A novel allele of the P-starvation tolerance gene OsPSTOL1 from African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud) and its distribution in the genus Oryza.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We have developed allele-specific markers for molecular breeding to transfer the PSTOL1 gene from Kasalath to African mega-varieties, including NERICAs, to improve their tolerance to P-deficient soil. The deficiency of phosphorus (P) in soil is a major problem in Sub-Saharan Africa due to general nutrient depletion and the presence of P-fixing soils. Developing rice cultivars with enhanced P efficiency would, therefore, represent a sustainable strategy to improve the livelihood of resource-poor farmers. Recently the Pup1 locus, a major QTL for tolerance to P deficiency in soil, was successfully narrowed-down to a major gene, the protein kinase OsPSTOL1 (P-starvation tolerance), which was found to be generally absent from modern irrigated rice varieties. Our target is to improve the tolerance of African mega-varieties to P deficiency through marker-assisted introgression of PSTOL1. As a first step, we have determined the Pup1 haplotype and surveyed the presence or absence of PSTOL1 and other genes of the Pup1 locus in African mega-varieties, NERICAs (New Rice for Africa) and their Oryza glaberrima parents. Here, we report the presence of a novel PSTOL1 allele in upland NERICAs that was inherited from the O. glaberrima parent CG14. This allele showed a 35 base-pair substitution when aligned to the Kasalath allele, but maintained a fully conserved kinase domain, and is present in most O. glaberrima accessions evaluated. In-silico and marker analysis indicated that many other genes of the Kasalath Pup1 locus were missing in the O. glaberrima genome, including the dirigent-like gene OsPupK20-2, which was shown to be downstream of PSTOL1. We have developed several allele-specific markers for the use for molecular breeding to transfer the PSTOL1 gene from Kasalath to African mega-varieties, including NERICAs.
24723033	Functional conservation of the glycosyltransferase gene GT47A in the monocot rice.	2014	J Plant Res	Glucuronoarabinoxylan is the major hemicellulose in grass cell walls, yet the mechanism of xylan synthesis in monocot plants is still unclear. Unraveling the genes involved in the biosynthesis of xylan in rice will be very important for the utilization of rice straw as a source of bioenergy in the future. In this report, we investigated the functional role of a rice gene homologous to Arabidopsis IRREGULAR XYLEM10 (IRX10), belonging to the glycosyl transferase (GT) gene family 47 (GT47), in the biosynthesis of xylan. The protein sequence of OsGT47A from rice exhibits a 93.49% similarity to IRX10, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glucuronoxylan in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis of the GT47 glycosyl transferase family in the rice genome revealed that OsGT47A is a closely related homolog of IRX10 and IRX10L. Expression pattern analysis showed that the OsGT47A gene is highly expressed in the rice stem. Overexpression of OsGT47A in the irx10 irx10L double mutant rescued the plant growth phenotype and restored secondary wall thickness. Analysis of monosaccharides indicated that the rescued plants had levels of xylose identical to those of the wild type plants, and the fluorescence signals were restored in the complementation plants by xylan immunolocalization. The OsGT47A complementation under the native promoter of Arabidopsis IRX10L (ProIRX10L) partially rescued the double mutant, indicating that OsGT47A is functionally equivalent to IRX10L. Together, these results suggest that the IRX10 homolog OsGT47A exhibits functional conservation and is most likely involved in xylan synthesis in rice.
24777821	OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK in Group C and phosphorylates OsbHLH65, a transcription factor binding to the E-box element.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsMPK3 is a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to Group C and directly phosphorylates OsbHLH65 in the nucleus. OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 are induced by biotic stress and defense-related hormones. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the majority of signaling pathways that regulate plant development and stress tolerance via the phosphorylation of target molecules. Plant MAPKs are classified into two subtypes, TEY and TDY, according to the TxY (x = E or D) motif in their activation loop, and the TDY motif is unique to plant MAPKs. In rice, 17 MAPKs have been classified into six groups. To date, the functions of many TDY-type rice MAPKs have been characterized, but little is known of the TEY-type MAPKs in Group C and their possible target substrates. In the study reported here, we determined that a TEY-type rice MAPK belonging to subgroup C, named OsMPK3, phosphorylates its substrate OsbHLH65 in the nucleus. Our electrophoresis mobility shift assay results revealed that OsbHLH65 specifically binds to the E-box cis-element, but not to the G-box. Both OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 were induced by treatments with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), and defense-related hormones, such as methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Our results suggest the possibility that OsMPK3 contributes to the defense signal transduction by phosphorylating the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor.
24704865	Rice nicotianamine synthase localizes to particular vesicles for proper function.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Graminaceous plants release mugineic acid family phytosiderophores to acquire iron from the soil. Recently, we reported that particular vesicles are involved in deoxymugineic acid (DMA) and nicotianamine (NA) biosynthesis and in DMA secretion from rice roots. A fusion protein of rice NA synthase 2 (OsNAS2) and synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) was observed in a dot-like pattern, moving dynamically within the cell. OsNAS2 mutated in the tyrosine motif or di-leucine motif, which was reported to be involved in cellular transport, caused a disruption in vesicular movement and vesicular localization, respectively. Unlike OsNAS2, Arabidopsis NA synthases AtNAS1-4 were distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm with no localization in dot-like structures when transiently expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells. Interestingly, Fe deficiency-inducible genes were upregulated in the OsNAS2-sGFP plants, and the amounts of NA and DMA produced and DMA secreted by the OsNAS2-sGFP plants were significantly higher than in those by the non-transformants and domain-mutated lines. We propose a model for OsNAS2-localized vesicles in rice, and discuss why the introduction of OsNAS2-sGFP caused a disturbance in Fe homeostasis.
24843077	Maintenance of Chloroplast Structure and Function by Overexpression of the Rice MONOGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE Gene Leads to Enhanced Salt Tolerance in Tobacco.	2014	Plant Physiol	In plants, the galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactodiacylglycerol (DGDG) are major constituents of photosynthetic membranes in chloroplasts. One of the key enzymes for the biosynthesis of these galactolipids is MGDG synthase (MGD). To investigate the role of MGD in the plant's response to salt stress, we cloned an MGD gene from rice (Oryza sativa) and generated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing OsMGD. The MGD activity in OsMGD transgenic plants was confirmed to be higher than that in the wild-type tobacco cultivar SR1. Immunoblot analysis indicated that OsMGD was enriched in the outer envelope membrane of the tobacco chloroplast. Under salt stress, the transgenic plants exhibited rapid shoot growth and high photosynthetic rate as compared with the wild type. Transmission electron microscopy observation showed that the chloroplasts from salt-stressed transgenic plants had well-developed thylakoid membranes and properly stacked grana lamellae, whereas the chloroplasts from salt-stressed wild-type plants were fairly disorganized and had large membrane-free areas. Under salt stress, the transgenic plants also maintained higher chlorophyll levels. Lipid composition analysis showed that leaves of transgenic plants consistently contained significantly higher MGDG (including 18:3-16:3 and 18:3-18:3 species) and DGDG (including 18:3-16:3, 18:3-16:0, and 18:3-18:3 species) contents and higher DGDG-MGDG ratios than the wild type did under both control and salt stress conditions. These results show that overexpression of OsMGD improves salt tolerance in tobacco and that the galactolipids MGDG and DGDG play an important role in the regulation of chloroplast structure and function in the plant salt stress response.
24820023	Uncovering Divergence of Rice Exon Junction Complex Core Heterodimer Gene Duplication Reveals Their Essential Role in Growth, Development, and Reproduction.	2014	Plant Physiol	The exon junction complex (EJC) plays important developmental roles in animals; however, its role in plants is not well known. Here, we show various aspects of the divergence of each duplicated MAGO NASHI (MAGO) and Y14 gene pair in rice (Oryza sativa) encoding the putative EJC core subunits that form the obligate MAGO-Y14 heterodimers. OsMAGO1, OsMAGO2, and OsY14a were constitutively expressed in all tissues, while OsY14b was predominantly expressed in embryonic tissues. OsMAGO2 and OsY14b were more sensitive to different stresses than OsMAGO1 and OsY14a, and their encoded protein pair shared 93.8% and 46.9% sequence identity, respectively. Single MAGO down-regulation in rice did not lead to any phenotypic variation; however, double gene knockdowns generated short rice plants with abnormal flowers, and the stamens of these flowers showed inhibited degradation and absorption of both endothecium and tapetum, suggesting that OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2 were functionally redundant. OsY14a knockdowns phenocopied OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 mutants, while down-regulation of OsY14b failed to induce plantlets, suggesting the functional specialization of OsY14b in embryogenesis. OsMAGO1OsMAGO2OsY14a triple down-regulation enhanced the phenotypes of OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 and OsY14a down-regulated mutants, indicating that they exert developmental roles in the MAGO-Y14 heterodimerization mode. Modified gene expression was noted in the altered developmental pathways in these knockdowns, and the transcript splicing of UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (OsUDT1), a key regulator in stamen development, was uniquely abnormal. Concomitantly, MAGO and Y14 selectively bound to the OsUDT1 premessenger RNA, suggesting that rice EJC subunits regulate splicing. Our work provides novel insights into the function of the EJC locus in growth, development, and reproduction in angiosperms and suggests a role for these genes in the adaptive evolution of cereals.
24884869	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK9 positively regulates drought stress tolerance and spikelet fertility.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: In plants, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in tolerance to abiotic stresses and in plant seed development. However, the functions of only a few rice CDPKs have been clarified. At present, it is unclear whether CDPKs also play a role in regulating spikelet fertility.

RESULTS: We cloned and characterized the rice CDPK gene, OsCPK9. OsCPK9 transcription was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), PEG6000, and NaCl treatments. The results of OsCPK9 overexpression (OsCPK9-OX) and OsCPK9 RNA interference (OsCPK9-RNAi) analyses revealed that OsCPK9 plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance and spikelet fertility. Physiological analyses revealed that OsCPK9 improves drought stress tolerance by enhancing stomatal closure and by improving the osmotic adjustment ability of the plant. It also improves pollen viability, thereby increasing spikelet fertility. In OsCPK9-OX plants, shoot and root elongation showed enhanced sensitivity to ABA, compared with that of wild-type. Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCPK9 affected the transcript levels of ABA- and stress-responsive genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that OsCPK9 is a positive regulator of abiotic stress tolerance, spikelet fertility, and ABA sensitivity.
24862452	The rice gene OsZFP6 functions in multiple stress tolerance responses in yeast and Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	The role of zinc finger proteins in organismal stress conditions has been widely reported. However, little is known concerning the function of CCHC-type zinc finger proteins in rice. In this study, OsZFP6, a rice CCHC-type zinc finger protein 6 gene, was cloned from rice using RT-PCR. The OsZFP6 protein contains 305 amino acids and a conserved zinc finger domain and is localised to the nucleus. Southern blot analysis revealed that a single copy was encoded in the rice genome. OsZFP6 expression was increased by abiotic stress, including salt (NaCl), alkali (NaHCO3) and H2O2 treatment. When OsZFP6 was transformed into yeast, the transgenic yeast showed significantly increased resistance to NaHCO3 compared to the control. Moreover, Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsZFP6 were more tolerant to both NaHCO3 and H2O2 treatments. Overall, we uncovered a role for OsZFP6 in abiotic stress responses and identified OsZFP6 as a putatively useful gene for developing crops with increased alkali and H2O2 tolerance.
24823923	Heat shock protein 70 is necessary for Rice stripe virus infection in plants.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	Heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70s) are a highly conserved family of genes in eukaryotes, and are involved in a remarkable variety of cellular processes. In many plant positive-stranded RNA viruses, HSP70 participates in the construction of a viral replication complex and plays various roles during viral infection. Here, we found increased expression of HSP70 following infection by Rice stripe virus (RSV), a negative-stranded RNA virus, in both rice (the natural host) and Nicotiana benthamiana (an experimental host). Heat treatment of N. benthamiana (Nb) plants enhanced viral infection, whereas RSV infection was retarded and viral RNAs accumulated at a low level when HSP70 was silenced. In both bimolecular fluorescence complement and in vitro pull-down assays, the N-terminus of RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) interacted and co-localized with the HSP70s of both plants (OsHSP70 and NbHSP70). The localization of the N-terminus of RdRp when expressed alone was not obviously different from when it was co-expressed with OsHSP or NbHSP, and vice versa. RSV infection also had no effect on the localization of host HSP70. These results demonstrate that host HSP70 is necessary for RSV infection and probably plays a role in viral replication by interacting with viral RdRp, which provides the first evidence of an interacting host protein related to RSV replication, which has been little studied to date.
24938613	Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Genet Mol Res	The genomic expression profile of the super-hybrid rice Liangyoupeijiu female parent Pei'ai 64S in different tissues at different developmental stages under low temperature, drought, and high temperature stresses were detected using an Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array to screen upregulated and downregulated genes. In this study, we screened the drought-resistant gene OsRCI2-5, after which a constitutive OsRCI2-5 construct was created and transferred into Nipponbare. After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare. Gene expression profiling showed that the OsRCI2-5 gene was expressed in the rice leaves, stems, and flower organs. Subcellular localization revealed that the gene was located in the membranes, and hence, we can deduce that a membrane signal peptide was responsible for signal transduction.
24802508	Recombinant expression and characterization of the cytoplasmic rice β-glucosidase Os1BGlu4.	2014	PLoS One	The Os1BGlu4 β-glucosidase is the only glycoside hydrolase family 1 member in rice that is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. To characterize the biochemical function of rice Os1BGlu4, the Os1bglu4 cDNA was cloned and used to express a thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After removal of the tag, the purified recombinant Os1BGlu4 (rOs1BGlu4) exhibited an optimum pH of 6.5, which is consistent with Os1BGlu4's cytoplasmic localization. Fluorescence microscopy of maize protoplasts and tobacco leaf cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Os1BGlu4 confirmed the cytoplasmic localization. Purified rOs1BGlu4 can hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-β-D-glucoside (pNPGlc) efficiently (kcat/Km  =  17.9 mM(-1) · s(-1)), and hydrolyzes pNP-β-D-fucopyranoside with about 50% the efficiency of the pNPGlc. Among natural substrates tested, rOs1BGlu4 efficiently hydrolyzed β-(1,3)-linked oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-3, and β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharide of DP 3-4, and hydrolysis of salicin, esculin and p-coumaryl alcohol was also detected. Analysis of the hydrolysis of pNP-β-cellobioside showed that the initial hydrolysis was between the two glucose molecules, and suggested rOs1BGlu4 transglucosylates this substrate. At 10 mM pNPGlc concentration, rOs1BGlu4 can transfer the glucosyl group of pNPGlc to ethanol and pNPGlc. This transglycosylation activity suggests the potential use of Os1BGlu4 for pNP-oligosaccharide and alkyl glycosides synthesis.
24834920	Mutation in xyloglucan 6-xylosytransferase results in abnormal root hair development in Oryza sativa.	2014	J Exp Bot	Root hairs are important for nutrient uptake, anchorage, and plant-microbe interactions. From a population of rice (Oryza sativa) mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a short root hair2 (srh2) mutant was identified. In hydroponic culture, srh2 seedlings were significantly reduced in root hair length. Bubble-like extrusions and irregular epidermal cells were observed at the tips of srh2 root hairs when grown under acidic conditions, suggesting the possible reduction of the tensile strength of the cell wall in this mutant. Map-based cloning identified a mutation in the gene encoding xyloglucan (XyG) 6-xylosyltransferase (OsXXT1). OsXXT1 displays more than 70% amino acid sequence identity with the previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 1 (AtXXT1) and XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 2 (AtXXT2), which catalyse the transfer of xylose onto β-1,4-glucan chains. Furthermore, expression of the full-length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant. Transgenic plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells. These results demonstrate the importance of OsXXT1 in maintaining cell wall structure and tensile strength in rice, a typical grass species that contains relatively low XyG content in cell walls.
24971328	Basal transcription factor 3 plays an important role in seed germination and seedling growth of rice.	2014	Biomed Res Int	BTF3 has been recognized to be involved in plant growth and development. But its function remains mostly unknown during seed germination and seedling stage. Here, we have analyzed OsBTF3-related sequences in Oryza sativa L. subspecies, japonica, which resembles with the conserved domain of a nascent polypeptide associated complex (NAC) with different homologs of OsBTF3 and human BTF3. Inhibition of Osj10gBTF3 has led to considerable morphological changes during seed germination and seedling growth. Germination percentage was not influenced by the application of GA3, ABA, and NaCl but all concentrations caused wild-type (WT) seeds to germinate more rapidly than the RNAi (Osj10gBTF3 (Ri)) transgenic lines. Seedling inhibition was more severe in the Osj10gBTF3 (Ri) seedlings compared with their WT especially when treated with 100 or 200 μM GA3; 50% reduction in shoots was observed in Osj10gBTF3 (Ri) seedlings. The expression of Osj3g1BTF3, Osj3g2BTF3 and Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by NaCl, ABA, and GA3 stresses in both Osj10gBTF3 (Ri) lines and WT at the early seedling stage, suggesting that Osj3g1BTF3 and Osj10gBTF3 are much similar but different from Osj3g2BTF3 in biological function. These results show that OsBTF3 plays an important role in seed germination and seedling growth gives a new perception demonstrating that more multifaceted regulatory functions are linked with BTF3 in plants.
24865494	Maize ZmRACK1 is involved in the plant response to fungal phytopathogens.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) belongs to a protein subfamily containing a tryptophan-aspartic acid-domain (WD) repeat structure. Compelling evidence indicates that RACK1 can interact with many signal molecules and affect different signal transduction pathways. In this study, we cloned a maize RACK1 gene (ZmRACK1) by RT-PCR. The amino acid sequence of ZmRACK1 had seven WD repeats in which there were typical GH (glycine-histidine) and WD dipeptides. Comparison with OsRACK1 from rice revealed 89% identity at the amino acid level. Expression pattern analysis by RT-PCR showed that ZmRACK1 was expressed in all analyzed tissues of maize and that its transcription in leaves was induced by abscisic acid and jasmonate at a high concentration. Overexpression of ZmRACK1 in maize led to a reduction in symptoms caused by Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) on maize leaves. The expression levels of the pathogenesis-related protein genes, PR-1 and PR-5, increased 2.5-3 times in transgenic maize, and reactive oxygen species production was more active than in the wild-type. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that ZmRACK1 could interact with RAC1, RAR1 and SGT1. This study and previous work leads us to believe that ZmRACK1 may form a complex with regulators of plant disease resistance to coordinate maize reactions to pathogens.
24865690	OsRACK1 is involved in abscisic acid- and H2O2-mediated signaling to regulate seed germination in rice (Oryza sativa, L.).	2014	PLoS One	The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is one member of the most important WD repeat-containing family of proteins found in all eukaryotes and is involved in multiple signaling pathways. However, compared with the progress in the area of mammalian RACK1, our understanding of the functions and molecular mechanisms of RACK1 in the regulation of plant growth and development is still in its infancy. In the present study, we investigated the roles of rice RACK1A gene (OsRACK1A) in controlling seed germination and its molecular mechanisms by generating a series of transgenic rice lines, of which OsRACK1A was either over-expressed or under-expressed. Our results showed that OsRACK1A positively regulated seed germination and negatively regulated the responses of seed germination to both exogenous ABA and H2O2. Inhibition of ABA biosynthesis had no enhancing effect on germination, whereas inhibition of ABA catabolism significantly suppressed germination. ABA inhibition on seed germination was almost fully recovered by exogenous H2O2 treatment. Quantitative analyses showed that endogenous ABA levels were significantly higher and H2O2 levels significantly lower in OsRACK1A-down regulated transgenic lines as compared with those in wildtype or OsRACK1A-up regulated lines. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcript levels of OsRbohs and amylase genes, RAmy1A and RAmy3D, were significantly lower in OsRACK1A-down regulated transgenic lines. It is concluded that OsRACK1A positively regulates seed germination by controlling endogenous levels of ABA and H2O2 and their interaction.
24805883	Divergence of the expression and subcellular localization of CCR4-associated factor 1 (CAF1) deadenylase proteins in Oryza sativa.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Deadenylation, also called poly(A) tail shortening, is the first, rate-limiting step in the general cytoplasmic mRNA degradation in eukaryotic cells. The CCR4-NOT complex, containing the two key components carbon catabolite repressor 4 (CCR4) and CCR4-associated factor 1 (CAF1), is a major player in deadenylation. CAF1 belongs to the RNase D group in the DEDD superfamily, and is a protein conserved through evolution from yeast to humans and plants. Every higher plant, including Arabidopsis and rice, contains a CAF1 multigene family. In this study, we identified and cloned four OsCAF1 genes (OsCAF1A, OsCAF1B, OsCAF1G, and OsCAF1H) from rice. Four recombinant OsCAF1 proteins, rOsCAF1A, rOsCAF1B, rOsCAF1G, and rOsCAF1H, all exhibited 3'-5' exonuclease activity in vitro. Point mutations in the catalytic residues of each analyzed recombinant OsCAF1 proteins were shown to disrupt deadenylase activity. OsCAF1A and OsCAF1G mRNA were found to be abundant in the leaves of mature plants. Two types of OsCAF1B mRNA transcript were detected in an inverse expression pattern in various tissues. OsCAF1B was transient, induced by drought, cold, abscisic acid, and wounding treatments. OsCAF1H mRNA was not detected either under normal conditions or during most stress treatments, but only accumulated during heat stress. Four OsCAF1-reporter fusion proteins were localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition, when green fluorescent protein fused with OsCAF1B, OsCAF1G, and OsCAF1H, respectively, fluorescent spots were observed in the nucleolus. OsCAF1B fluorescent fusion proteins were located in discrete cytoplasmic foci and fibers. We present evidences that OsCAF1B colocalizes with AtXRN4, a processing body marker, and AtKSS12, a microtubules maker, indicating that OsCAF1B is a component of the plant P-body and associate with microtubules. Our findings provide biochemical evidence that OsCAF1 proteins may be involved in the deadenylation in rice. The unique expression patterns of each OsCAF1 were observed in various tissues when undergoing abiotic stress treatments, implying that each CAF1 gene in rice plays a specific role in the development and stress response of a plant.
24915093	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2014	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	Dehydroascorbate reductase from Oryza sativa L. japonica (OsDHAR), a key enzyme in the regeneration of vitamin C, maintains reduced pools of ascorbic acid to detoxify reactive oxygen species. In previous studies, the overexpression of OsDHAR in transgenic rice increased grain yield and biomass as well as the amount of ascorbate, suggesting that ascorbate levels are directly associated with crop production in rice. Hence, it has been speculated that the increased level of antioxidants generated by OsDHAR protects rice from oxidative damage and increases the yield of rice grains. However, the crystal structure and detailed mechanisms of this important enzyme need to be further elucidated. In this study, recombinant OsDHAR protein was purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at pH 8.0 and 298 K. Plate-shaped crystals were obtained using 0.15 M potassium bromide, 30%(w/v) PEG MME 2000 as a precipitant, and the crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 Å on beamline 5C at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The X-ray diffraction data indicated that the crystal contained one OsDHAR molecule in the asymmetric unit and belonged to space group P2₁ with unit-cell parameters a=47.03, b=48.38, c=51.83 Å, β=107.41°.
24788752	Functional characterization of the rice UDP-glucose 4-epimerase 1, OsUGE1: a potential role in cell wall carbohydrate partitioning during limiting nitrogen conditions.	2014	PLoS One	Plants grown under inadequate mineralized nitrogen (N) levels undergo N and carbon (C) metabolic re-programming which leads to significant changes in both soluble and insoluble carbohydrate profiles. However, relatively little information is available on the genetic factors controlling carbohydrate partitioning during adaptation to N-limitation conditions in plants. A gene encoding a uridine-diphospho-(UDP)-glucose 4-epimerase (OsUGE-1) from rice (Oryza sativa) was found to be N-responsive. We developed transgenic rice plants to constitutively over-express the OsUGE-1 gene (OsUGE1-OX1-2). The transgenic rice lines were similar in size to wild-type plants at the vegetative stage and at maturity regardless of the N-level tested. However, OsUGE1-OX lines maintained 18-24% more sucrose and 12-22% less cellulose in shoots compared to wild-type when subjected to sub-optimal N-levels. Interestingly, OsUGE1-OX lines maintained proportionally more galactose and glucose in the hemicellulosic polysaccharide profile of plants compared to wild-type plants when grown under low N. The altered cell wall C-partitioning during N-limitation in the OsUGE1-OX lines appears to be mediated by OsUGE1 via the repression of the cellulose synthesis associated genes, OsSus1, OsCesA4, 7, and 9. This relationship may implicate a novel control point for the deposition of UDP-glucose to the complex polysaccharide profiles of rice cell walls. However, a direct relationship between OsUGE1 and cell wall C-partitioning during N-limitation requires further investigation.
24812252	Phylogenetic analyses provide the first insights into the evolution of OVATE family proteins in land plants.	2014	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The OVATE gene encodes a nuclear-localized regulatory protein belonging to a distinct family of plant-specific proteins known as the OVATE family proteins (OFPs). OVATE was first identified as a key regulator of fruit shape in tomato, with nonsense mutants displaying pear-shaped fruits. However, the role of OFPs in plant development has been poorly characterized.

METHODS: Public databases were searched and a total of 265 putative OVATE protein sequences were identified from 13 sequenced plant genomes that represent the major evolutionary lineages of land plants. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the alignment of the conserved OVATE domain from these 13 selected plant genomes. The expression patterns of tomato SlOFP genes were analysed via quantitative real-time PCR. The pattern of OVATE gene duplication resulting in the expansion of the gene family was determined in arabidopsis, rice and tomato.

KEY RESULTS: Genes for OFPs were found to be present in all the sampled land plant genomes, including the early-diverged lineages, mosses and lycophytes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the conserved OVATE domain defined 11 sub-groups of OFPs in angiosperms. Different evolutionary mechanisms are proposed for OVATE family evolution, namely conserved evolution and divergent expansion. Characterization of the AtOFP family in arabidopsis, the OsOFP family in rice and the SlOFP family in tomato provided further details regarding the evolutionary framework and revealed a major contribution of tandem and segmental duplications towards expansion of the OVATE gene family.

CONCLUSIONS: This first genome-wide survey on OFPs provides new insights into the evolution of the OVATE protein family and establishes a solid base for future functional genomics studies on this important but poorly characterized regulatory protein family in plants.
24847337	OsRAD51C is essential for double-strand break repair in rice meiosis.	2014	Front Plant Sci	RAD51C is one of the RAD51 paralogs that plays an important role in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Here, we identified and characterized OsRAD51C, the rice homolog of human RAD51C. The Osrad51c mutant plant is normal in vegetative growth but exhibits complete male and female sterility. Cytological investigation revealed that homologous pairing and synapsis were severely disrupted. Massive chromosome fragmentation occurred during metaphase I in Osrad51c meiocytes, and was fully suppressed by the CRC1 mutation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that OsRAD51C localized onto the chromosomes from leptotene to early pachytene during prophase I, and that normal loading of OsRAD51C was dependent on OsREC8, PAIR2, and PAIR3. Additionally, ZEP1 did not localize properly in Osrad51c, indicating that OsRAD51C is required for synaptonemal complex assembly. Our study also provided evidence in support of a functional divergence in RAD51C among organisms.
24817585	Identification and functional characterization of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase protein from rice and structural elucidation by in silico approach.	2014	Planta	The sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (S6PDH) is a key enzyme for sorbitol synthesis and plays an important role in the alleviation of salinity stress in plants. Despite the huge significance, the structure and the mode of action of this enzyme are still not known. In the present study, sequence analysis, cloning, expression, activity assays and enzyme kinetics using various substrates (glucose-6-phosphate, sorbitol-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate) were performed to establish the functional role of S6PDH protein from rice (Oryza sativa). For the structural analysis of the protein, a comparative homology model was prepared on the basis of percentage sequence identity and substrate similarity using the crystal structure of human aldose reductase in complex with glucose-6-phosphate and NADP(+) (PDB ID: 2ACQ) as a template. Molecular docking was performed for studying the structural details of substrate binding and possible enzyme mechanism. The cloned sequence resulted into an active recombinant protein when expressed into a bacterial expression system. The purified recombinant protein was found to be active with glucose-6-phosphate and sorbitol-6-phosphate; however, activity against mannose-6-phosphate was not found. The K m values for glucose-6-phosphate and sorbitol-6-phosphate were found to be 15.9 ± 0.2 and 7.21 ± 0.5 mM, respectively. A molecular-level analysis of the active site of OsS6PDH provides valuable information about the enzyme mechanism and requisite enantioselectivity for its physiological substrates. Thus, the fundamental studies of structure and function of OsS6PDH could serve as the basis for the future studies of bio-catalytic applications of this enzyme.
24840804	Suppression of OsRAD51D results in defects in reproductive development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant J	The cellular roles of RAD51 paralogs in somatic and reproductive growth have been extensively described in a wide range of animal systems and, to a lesser extent, in Arabidopsis, a dicot model plant. Here, the OsRAD51D gene was identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot model crop. In the rice genome, three alternative OsRAD51D mRNA splicing variants, OsRAD51D.1, OsRAD51D.2, and OsRAD51D.3, were predicted. Yeast two-hybrid studies, however, showed that only OsRAD51D.1 interacted with OsRAD51B and OsRAD51C paralogs, suggesting that OsRAD51D.1 is a functional OsRAD51D protein in rice. Loss-of-function osrad51d mutant rice plants displayed normal vegetative growth. However, the mutant plants were defective in reproductive growth, resulting in sterile flowers. Homozygous osrad51d mutant flowers exhibited impaired development of lemma and palea and contained unusual numbers of stamens and stigmas. During early meiosis, osrad51d pollen mother cells (PMCs) failed to form normal homologous chromosome pairings. In subsequent meiotic progression, mutant PMCs represented fragmented chromosomes. The osrad51d pollen cells contained numerous abnormal micro-nuclei that resulted in malfunctioning pollen. The abnormalities of heterozygous mutant and T2 Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D RNAi-knock-down transgenic plants were intermediate between those of wild type and homozygous mutant plants. The osrad51d and Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D plants contained longer telomeres compared with wild type plants, indicating that OsRAD51D is a negative factor for telomere lengthening. Overall, these results suggest that OsRAD51D plays a critical role in reproductive growth in rice. This essential function of OsRAD51D is distinct from Arabidopsis, in which AtRAD51D is not an essential factor for meiosis or reproductive development.
24905845	Heme-heme oxygenase 1 system is involved in ammonium tolerance by regulating antioxidant defence in Oryza sativa.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Despite substantial evidence showing the ammonium-altered redox homeostasis in plants, the involvement and molecular mechanism of heme-heme oxygenase 1 (heme-HO1), a novel antioxidant system, in the regulation of ammonium tolerance remain elusive. To fill in these gaps, the biological function of rice HO1 (OsSE5) was investigated. Results showed that NH4 Cl up-regulated rice OsSE5 expression. Oxidative stress and subsequent growth inhibition induced by excess NH4 Cl was partly mitigated by pretreatment with carbon monoxide (CO, a by-product of HO1 activity) or intensified by zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP, a potent inhibitor of HO1 activity). Pretreatment with HO1 inducer hemin, not only up-regulated OsSE5 expression and HO activity, but also rescued the down-regulation of antioxidant transcripts, total and related isozymatic activities, thus significantly counteracting the excess NH4 Cl-triggered reactive oxygen species overproduction, lipid peroxidation and growth inhibition. OsSE5 RNAi transgenic rice plants revealed NH4 Cl-hypersensitive phenotype with impaired antioxidant defence, both of which could be rescued by CO but not hemin. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing OsSE5 also exhibited enhanced tolerance to NH4 Cl, which might be attributed to the up-regulation of several antioxidant transcripts. Altogether, these results illustrated the involvement of heme-HO1 system in ammonium tolerance by enhancing antioxidant defence, which may improve plant tolerance to excess ammonium fertilizer.
24616269	DWARF3 participates in an SCF complex and associates with DWARF14 to suppress rice shoot branching.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Strigolactones (SLs) are a novel class of plant hormones that inhibit shoot branching. Currently, two proteins in rice are thought to play crucial roles in SL signal transduction. DWARF14 (D14), an α/β hydrolase, is responsible for SL perception, while DWARF3 (D3), an F-box protein with leucine-rich repeats, is essential for SL signal transduction. However, how these two proteins transmit SL signals to downstream factors remains unclear. Here, we characterized a high-tillering dwarf rice mutant, gsor300097, which is insensitive to GR24, a synthetic analog of SL. Mapping and sequencing analysis showed that gsor300097 is a novel allelic mutant of D3, in which a nonsense mutation truncates the protein from 720 to 527 amino acids. The D3 gene was strongly expressed in root, leaf, shoot base and panicle. Nuclear-localized F-box protein D3 played a role in the SCF complex by interacting with OSK1, OSK5 or OSK20 and OsCullin1. In addition, D3 associated with D14 in a GR24-dependent manner in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggested that D3 assembled into an SCF(D3) complex and associated with D14 to suppress rice shoot branching.
24906444	OsMYB103L, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, influences leaf rolling and mechanical strength in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The shape of grass leaves possesses great value in both agronomy and developmental biology research. Leaf rolling is one of the important traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding. MYB transcription factors are one of the largest gene families and have important roles in plant development, metabolism and stress responses. However, little is known about their functions in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, we report the functional characterization of a rice gene, OsMYB103L, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor. OsMYB103L was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB103L in rice resulted in a rolled leaf phenotype. Further analyses showed that expression levels of several cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) were significantly increased, as was the cellulose content in OsMYB103L overexpressing lines. Knockdown of OsMYB103L by RNA interference led to a decreased level of cellulose content and reduced mechanical strength in leaves. Meanwhile, the expression levels of several CESA genes were decreased in these knockdown lines.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that OsMYB103L may target CESA genes for regulation of cellulose synthesis and could potentially be engineered for desirable leaf shape and mechanical strength in rice.
24935343	Patterns of nucleotide diversity and phenotypes of two domestication related genes (OsC1 and Wx) in indigenous rice varieties in Northeast India.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: During the domestication of crops, individual plants with traits desirable for human needs have been selected from their wild progenitors. Consequently, genetic and nucleotide diversity of genes associated with these selected traits in crop plants are expected to be lower than their wild progenitors. In the present study, we surveyed the pattern of nucleotide diversity of two selected trait specific genes, Wx and OsC1, which regulate amylose content and apiculus coloration respectively in cultivated rice varieties. The analyzed samples were collected from a wide geographic area in Northeast (NE) India, and included contrasting phenotypes considered to be associated with selected genes, namely glutinous and nonglutinous grains and colored and colorless apiculus.

RESULTS: No statistically significant selection signatures were detected in both Wx and OsC1gene sequences. However, low level of selection that varied across the length of each gene was evident. The glutinous type varieties showed higher levels of nucleotide diversity at the Wx locus (πtot = 0.0053) than nonglutinous type varieties (πtot = 0.0043). The OsC1 gene revealed low levels of selection among the colorless apiculus varieties with lower nucleotide diversity (πtot = 0.0010) than in the colored apiculus varieties (πtot = 0.0023).

CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that functional mutations at Wx and OsC1genes considered to be associated with specific phenotypes do not necessarily correspond to the phenotypes in indigenous rice varieties in NE India. This suggests that other than previously reported genomic regions may also be involved in determination of these phenotypes.
25219300	Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply.	2014	Plant Sci	Nitrogen (N) plays a critical role in plant growth and productivity and PTR/NRT1 transporters are critical for rice growth. In this study, OsPTR6, a PTR/NRT1 transporter, was over-expressed in the Nipponbare rice cultivar by Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation using the ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter. Three single-copy T2 generation transgenic lines, named OE1, OE5 and OE6, were produced and subjected to hydroponic growth experiments in different nitrogen treatments. The results showed the plant height and biomass of the over-expression lines were increased, and plant N accumulation and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities were enhanced at 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3. The expression of OsATM1 genes in over-expression lines showed that the OsPTR6 over expression increased OsAMT1.1, OsATM1.2 and OsAMT1.3 expression at 0.2 and 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3. However, nitrogen utilisation efficiency (NUE) was decreased at 5.0mmol/LNH4(+). These data suggest that over-expression of the OsPTR6 gene could increase rice growth through increasing ammonium transporter expression and glutamine synthetase activity (GSA), but decreases nitrogen use efficiency under conditions of high ammonium supply.
24892523	Overexpression of phosphomimic mutated OsWRKY53 leads to enhanced blast resistance in rice.	2014	PLoS One	WRKY transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of plant defense responses. We previously reported that OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. In this study, we identified OsWRKY53 as a substrate of OsMPK3/OsMPK6, components of a fungal PAMP-responsive MAPK cascade in rice, and analyzed the effect of OsWRKY53 phosphorylation on the regulation of basal defense responses to a virulence race of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae strain Ina86-137. An in vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the OsMPK3/OsMPK6 activated by OsMKK4 phosphorylated OsWRKY53 recombinant protein at its multiple clustered serine-proline residues (SP cluster). When OsWRKY53 was coexpressed with a constitutively active mutant of OsMKK4 in a transient reporter gene assay, the enhanced transactivation activity of OsWRKY53 was found to be dependent on phosphorylation of the SP cluster. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 (OsWRKY53SD) showed further-enhanced disease resistance to the blast fungus compared to native OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants, and a substantial number of defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes, were more upregulated in the OsWRKY53SD-overexpressing plants compared to the OsWRKY53-overexpressing plants. These results strongly suggest that the OsMKK4-OsMPK3/OsMPK6 cascade regulates transactivation activity of OsWRKY53, and overexpression of the phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 results in a major change to the rice transcriptome at steady state that leads to activation of a defense response against the blast fungus in rice plants.
24970010	Comprehensive structural, interaction and expression analysis of CBL and CIPK complement during abiotic stresses and development in rice.	2014	Cell Calcium	Calcium ion is involved in diverse physiological and developmental pathways. One of the important roles of calcium is a signaling messenger, which regulates signal transduction in plants. CBL (calcineurin B-like protein) is one of the calcium sensors that specifically interact with a family of serine-threonine protein kinases designated as CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). The coordination of these two gene families defines complexity of the signaling networks in several stimulus-response-coupling during various environmental stresses. In Arabidopsis, both of these gene families have been extensively studied. To understand in-depth mechanistic interplay of CBL-CIPK mediated signaling pathways, expression analysis of entire set of CBL and CIPK genes in rice genome under three abiotic stresses (salt, cold and drought) and different developmental stages (3-vegetative stages and 11-reproductive stages) were done using microarray expression data. Interestingly, expression analysis showed that rice CBLs and CIPKs are not only involved in the abiotic stress but their significant role is also speculated in the developmental processes. Chromosomal localization of rice CBL and CIPK genes reveals that only OsCBL7 and OsCBL8 shows tandem duplication among CBLs whereas CIPKs were evolved by many tandem as well as segmental duplications. Duplicated OsCIPK genes showed variable expression pattern indicating the role of gene duplication in the extension and functional diversification of CIPK gene family in rice. Arabidopsis SOS3/CBL4 related genes in rice (OsCBL4, OsCBL5, OsCBL7 and OsCBL8) were employed for interaction studies with rice and Arabidopsis CIPKs. OsCBLs and OsCIPKs are not only found structurally similar but likely to be functionally equivalent to Arabidopsis CBLs and CIPKs genes since SOS3/CBL4 related OsCBLs interact with more or less similarly to rice and Arabidopsis CIPKs and exhibited an interaction pattern comparable with Arabidopsis SOS3/CBL4.
24932524	Mapped clone and functional analysis of leaf-color gene Ygl7 in a rice hybrid (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2014	PLoS One	Leaf-color is an effective marker to identify the hybridization of rice. Leaf-color related genes function in chloroplast development and the photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis of higher plants. The ygl7 (yellow-green leaf 7) is a mutant with spontaneous yellow-green leaf phenotype across the whole lifespan but with no change to its yield traits. We cloned gene Ygl7 (Os03g59640) which encodes a magnesium-chelatase ChlD protein. Expression of ygl7 turns green-leaves to yellow, whereas RNAi-mediated silence of Ygl7 causes a lethal phenotype of the transgenic plants. This indicates the importance of the gene for rice plant. On the other hand, it corroborates that ygl7 is a non-null mutants. The content of photosynthetic pigment is lower in Ygl7 than the wild type, but its light efficiency was comparatively high. All these results indicated that the mutational YGL7 protein does not cause a complete loss of original function but instead acts as a new protein performing a new function. This new function partially includes its preceding function and possesses an additional feature to promote photosynthesis. Chl1, Ygl98, and Ygl3 are three alleles of the OsChlD gene that have been documented previously. However, mutational sites of OsChlD mutant gene and their encoded protein products were different in the three mutants. The three mutants have suppressed grain output. In our experiment, plant materials of three mutants (ygl7, chl1, and ygl98) all exhibited mutational leaf-color during the whole growth period. This result was somewhat different from previous studies. We used ygl7 as female crossed with chl1 and ygl98, respectively. Both the F1 and F2 generation display yellow-green leaf phenotype with their chlorophyll and carotenoid content falling between the values of their parents. Moreover, we noted an important phenomenon: ygl7-NIL's leaf-color is yellow, not yellowy-green, and this is also true of all back-crossed offspring with ygl7.
24912543	OsHK3 is a crucial regulator of abscisic acid signaling involved in antioxidant defense in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	In this study, the role of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) histidine kinase OsHK3 in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defense was investigated. Treatments with ABA, H2 O2 , and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsHK3 in rice leaves, and H2 O2 is required for ABA-induced increase in the expression of OsHK3 under water stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsHK3 is located in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. The transient expression analysis and the transient RNA interference test in rice protoplasts showed that OsHK3 is required for ABA-induced upregulation in the expression of antioxidant enzymes genes and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Further analysis showed that OsHK3 functions upstream of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes in ABA signaling. Moreover, OsHK3 was also shown to regulate the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase genes, OsrbohB and OsrbohE, and the production of H2 O2 in ABA signaling. Our data indicate that OsHK3 play an important role in the regulation of ABA-induced antioxidant defense and in the feedback regulation of H2 O2 production in ABA signaling.
25014258	Functional characterization of xanthoxin dehydrogenase in rice.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays a key role in biotic and abiotic stress responses. ABA metabolic genes are promising targets for molecular breeding work to improve stress tolerance in crops. The accumulation of ABA does not always improve stress tolerance since stress-induced accumulation of ABA in pollen inhibits the normal course of gametogenesis, affecting grain yields in cereals. This effect highlights the importance of manipulating the ABA levels according to the type of tissues. The aim of this study was to assign an ABA biosynthetic enzyme, xanthoxin dehydrogenase (XanDH), as a functional marker to modulate ABA levels in rice. XanDH is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family that catalyzes the conversion of xanthoxin to abscisyl aldehyde (ABAld). Previously, this enzyme had only been identified in Arabidopsis, as AtABA2. In this study, a XanDH named OsABA2 was identified in rice. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that a single gene encodes for OsABA2 in the rice genome. Its amino acid sequence contains two motifs that are essential for cofactor binding and catalytic activity. Expression analysis of OsABA2 mRNA showed that the transcript level did not change in response to treatment with ABA or dehydration. Recombinant OsABA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli converted xanthoxin to ABAld in an NAD-dependent manner. Moreover, expression of OsABA2 in an Arabidopsis aba2 mutant rescued the aba2 mutant phenotypes, characterized by reduced growth, increased water loss, and germination in the presence of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor or high concentration of glucose. These results indicate that OsABA2 is a rice XanDH that functions in ABA biosynthesis.
24901798	OsHUS1 facilitates accurate meiotic recombination in rice.	2014	PLoS Genet	Meiotic recombination normally takes place between allelic sequences on homologs. This process can also occur between non-allelic homologous sequences. Such ectopic interaction events can lead to chromosome rearrangements and are normally avoided. However, much remains unknown about how these ectopic interaction events are sensed and eliminated. In this study, using a screen in rice, we characterized a homolog of HUS1 and explored its function in meiotic recombination. In Oshus1 mutants, in conjunction with nearly normal homologous pairing and synapsis, vigorous, aberrant ectopic interactions occurred between nonhomologous chromosomes, leading to multivalent formation and subsequent chromosome fragmentation. These ectopic interactions relied on programmed meiotic double strand breaks and were formed in a manner independent of the OsMER3-mediated interference-sensitive crossover pathway. Although early homologous recombination events occurred normally, the number of interference-sensitive crossovers was reduced in the absence of OsHUS1. Together, our results indicate that OsHUS1 might be involved in regulating ectopic interactions during meiosis, probably by forming the canonical RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex.
24901230	From laboratory to field: OsNRAMP5-knockdown rice is a promising candidate for Cd phytoremediation in paddy fields.	2014	PLoS One	Previously, we reported that OsNRAMP5 functions as a manganese, iron, and cadmium (Cd) transporter. The shoot Cd content in OsNRAMP5 RNAi plants was higher than that in wild-type (WT) plants, whereas the total Cd content (roots plus shoots) was lower. For efficient Cd phytoremediation, we produced OsNRAMP5 RNAi plants using the natural high Cd-accumulating cultivar Anjana Dhan (A5i). Using a positron-emitting tracer imaging system, we assessed the time-course of Cd absorption and accumulation in A5i plants. Enhanced 107Cd translocation from the roots to the shoots was observed in A5i plants. To evaluate the phytoremediation capability of A5i plants, we performed a field experiment in a Cd-contaminated paddy field. The biomass of the A5i plants was unchanged by the suppression of OsNRAMP5 expression; the A5i plants accumulated twice as much Cd in their shoots as WT plants. Thus, A5i plants could be used for rapid Cd extraction and the efficient phytoremediation of Cd from paddy fields, leading to safer food production.
24926784	Rice acyl-CoA-binding proteins OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are differentially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are known to bind and transport acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids intracellularly. In our recent paper in the New Phytologist, we reported that the 6 acyl-CoA-binding proteins (OsACBPs) in rice (Oryza sativa) are distributed across various subcellular compartments in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) such as the cytosol (OsACBP1, OsACBP2 and OsACBP3), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) including the tubules (OsACBP4 and OsACBP5) and the cisternae (OsACBP4), and the peroxisomes (OsACBP6). Localization of OsACBP4::GFP to the peripheral ER cisternae and the central cisternal ER-like structures in transgenic Arabidopsis distinguished it from OsACBP5::GFP. We further report that besides the ER, OsACBP4::GFP and OsACBP5::GFP were also targeted to the membrane of ER bodies and ER-derived spherical structures, respectively, in transgenic Arabidopsis. These findings support our previous conclusion that OsACBP4 and OsACBP5 are not redundant proteins in the ER.
24958714	Plasma membrane localization is essential for Oryza sativa Pto-interacting protein 1a-mediated negative regulation of immune signaling in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Oryza sativa Pto-interacting protein 1a (OsPti1a), an ortholog of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlPti1, functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice (Oryza sativa). In ospti1a mutants, the activation of immune responses, including hypersensitive response-like cell death, is caused by loss of the OsPti1a protein; however, it is as yet unclear how OsPti1a suppresses immune responses. Here, we report that OsPti1a localizes to detergent-resistant membrane fractions of the plasma membrane through lipid modification of the protein's amino terminus, which is highly conserved among Pti1 orthologs in several plant species. Importantly, mislocalization of OsPti1a after deletion of its amino terminus reduced its ability to complement the mutant phenotypes, including hypersensitive response-like cell death. Furthermore, complex formation of OsPti1a depends on its amino terminus-mediated membrane localization. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of OsPti1a complex-interacting proteins identified several defense-related proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that appropriate complex formation by OsPti1a at the plasma membrane is required for the negative regulation of plant immune responses in rice.
25089296	OsSLI1, a homeodomain containing transcription activator, involves abscisic acid related stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	Homeodomain-leucine zipper type I (HD-Zip I) proteins are involved in the regulation of plant development and response to environmental stresses. In this study, OsSLI1 (Oryza sativa stress largely induced 1), encoding a member of the HD-Zip I subfamily, was isolated from rice. The expression of OsSLI1 was dramatically induced by multiple abiotic stresses and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). In silico sequence analysis discovered several cis-acting elements including multiple ABREs (ABA-responsive element binding factors) in the upstream promoter region of OsSLI1. The OsSLI1-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cells and the transcriptional activity of OsSLI1 was confirmed by the yeast hybrid system. Further, it was found that OsSLI1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant abl1 under stress conditions, suggesting that ABL1 probably negatively regulates OsSLI1 gene expression. Moreover, it was found that OsSLI1 was regulated in panicle development. Taken together, OsSLI1 may be a transcriptional activator regulating stress-responsive gene expression and panicle development in rice.
24940877	Differential acetylation of histone H3 at the regulatory region of OsDREB1b promoter facilitates chromatin remodelling and transcription activation during cold stress.	2014	PLoS One	The rice ortholog of DREB1, OsDREB1b, is transcriptionally induced by cold stress and over-expression of OsDREB1b results in increase tolerance towards high salt and freezing stress. This spatio-temporal expression of OsDREB1b is preceded by the change in chromatin structure at the promoter and the upstream region for gene activation. The promoter and the upstream region of OsDREB1b genes appear to be arranged into a nucleosome array. Nucleosome mapping of ∼ 700 bp upstream region of OsDREB1b shows two positioned nucleosomes between -610 to -258 and a weakly positioned nucleosome at the core promoter and the TSS. Upon cold stress, there is a significant change in the nucleosome arrangement at the upstream region with increase in DNaseI hypersensitivity or MNase digestion in the vicinity of cis elements and TATA box at the core promoter. ChIP assays shows hyper-acetylation of histone H3K9 throughout the locus whereas region specific increase was observed in H3K14ac and H3K27ac. Moreover, there is an enrichment of RNA PolII occupancy at the promoter region during transcription activation. There is no significant change in the H3 occupancy in OsDREB1b locus negating the possibility of nucleosome loss during cold stress. Interestingly, cold induced enhanced transcript level of OsDREB1b as well as histone H3 acetylation at the upstream region was found to diminish when stressed plants were returned to normal temperature. The result indicates absolute necessity of changes in chromatin conformation for the transcription up-regulation of OsDREB1b gene in response to cold stress. The combined results show the existence of closed chromatin conformation at the upstream and promoter region of OsDREB1b in the transcription "off" state. During cold stress, changes in region specific histone modification marks promote the alteration of chromatin structure to facilitate the binding of transcription machinery for proper gene expression.
25017161	Rice SAPs are responsive to multiple biotic stresses and overexpression of OsSAP1, an A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, enhances the basal resistance against pathogen infection in tobacco.	2014	Plant Sci	Eukaryotic A20/AN1 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) play an important role in the regulation of immune and stress response. After elucidation of the role of first such protein, OsSAP1, in abiotic stress tolerance, 18 rice stress associated protein (SAP) genes have been shown to be regulated by multiple abiotic stresses. In the present study, expression pattern of all the 18 OsSAP genes have been analysed in response to different biotic stress simulators, in order to get insights into their possible involvement in biotic stress tolerance. Our results showed the upregulation of OsSAP1 and OsSAP11 by all biotic stress simulator treatments. Furthermore, the functional role of OsSAP1 in plant defence responses has been explored through overexpression in transgenic plants. Constitutive expression of OsSAP1 in transgenic tobacco resulted into enhanced disease resistance against virulent bacterial pathogen, together with the upregulation of known defence-related genes. Present investigation suggests that rice SAPs are responsive to multiple biotic stresses and OsSAP1 plays a key role in basal resistance against pathogen infection. This strongly supports the involvement of rice SAPs in cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress signalling pathways, which makes them ideal candidate to design strategies for protecting crop plants against multiple stresses.
24813725	Overexpression of OsMYB4P, an R2R3-type MYB transcriptional activator, increases phosphate acquisition in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	R2R3 MYB transcription factors play regulatory roles in plant responses to various environmental stresses and nutrient deficiency. In this study, we isolated and designated OsMYB4P, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, from rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Dongjin') under phosphate-deficient conditions. OsMYB4P was localized in the nucleus and acted as a transcriptional activator. Transcriptional levels of OsMYB4P in cell suspension, shoots, and roots of rice increased under phosphate-deficient conditions. Shoots and roots of OsMYB4P-overexpressing plants grew well in high- and phosphate-deficient conditions. In addition, root system architecture was altered considerably as a result of OsMYB4P overexpression. Under both phosphate-sufficient and -deficient conditions, more Pi accumulated in shoots and roots of OsMYB4P-overexpressing plants than in the wild type. Overexpression of OsMYB4P led to greater expression of Pi transporter-family proteins OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT4, OsPT7, and OsPT8 in shoots, and to decreased or unchanged expression of these proteins in roots, with the exception of OsPT8. These results demonstrate that OsMYB4P may be associated with efficient utilization of Pi in rice through transcriptional activation of Pi homeostasis-related genes.
25071223	A novel rice C2H2-type zinc finger protein, ZFP36, is a key player involved in abscisic acid-induced antioxidant defence and oxidative stress tolerance in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	C2H2-type zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) have been shown to play important roles in the responses of plants to oxidative and abiotic stresses, and different members of this family might have different roles during stresses. Here a novel abscisic acid (ABA)- and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-responsive C2H2-type ZFP gene, ZFP36, is identified in rice. The analyses of ZFP36-overexpressing and silenced transgenic rice plants showed that ZFP36 is involved in ABA-induced up-regulation of the expression and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Overexpression of ZFP36 in rice plants was found to elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and to enhance the tolerance of rice plants to water stress and oxidative stress. In contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of ZFP36 had lower activities of antioxidant enzymes and was more sensitive to water stress and oxidative stress. ABA-induced H₂O₂ production and ABA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were shown to regulate the expression of ZFP36 in ABA signalling. On the other hand, ZFP36 also regulated the expression of NADPH oxidase genes, the production of H₂O₂, and the expression of OsMPK genes in ABA signalling. These results indicate that ZFP36 is required for ABA-induced antioxidant defence, for the tolerance of rice plants to water stress and oxidative stress, and for the regulation of the cross-talk between NADPH oxidase, H₂O₂, and MAPK in ABA signalling.
25037719	Young Leaf Chlorosis 2 encodes the stroma-localized heme oxygenase 2 which is required for normal tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice.	2014	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Rice heme oxygenase 2 (OsHO2) mutants are chlorophyll deficient with distinct tetrapyrrole metabolite and transcript profiles, suggesting a potential regulatory role of the stromal-localized OsHO2 in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. In plants, heme oxygenases (HOs) are classified into the subfamilies HO1 and HO2. HO1 are highly conserved plastid enzymes required for synthesizing the chromophore in phytochromes which mediate a number of light-regulated responses. However, the physiological and biochemical functions of HO2, which are distantly related to HO1, are not well understood, especially in crop plants. From a population of (60)Coγ-irradiated rice mutants, we identified the ylc2 (young leaf chlorosis 2) mutant which displays a chlorosis phenotype in seedlings with substantially reduced chlorophyll content. Normal leaf pigmentation is gradually restored in older plants while newly emerged leaves remain yellow. Transmission electron microscopy further revealed defective chloroplast structures in the ylc2 seedlings. Map-based cloning located the OsYLC2 gene on chromosome 3 and it encodes the OsHO2 protein. The gene identification was confirmed by complementation and T-DNA mutant analyses. Subcellular localization and chloroplast fractionation experiments indicated that OsHO2 resides in the stroma. However, recombinant enzyme assay demonstrated that OsHO2 is not a functional HO enzyme. Analysis of tetrapyrrole metabolites revealed the reduced levels of most chlorophyll and phytochromobilin precursors in the ylc2 mutant. On the other hand, elevated accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid and Mg-protoporphyrin IX was observed. These unique metabolite changes are accompanied by consistent changes in the expression levels of the corresponding tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes. Taken together, our work suggests that OsHO2 has a potential regulatory role for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice.
25036785	Dlf1, a WRKY transcription factor, is involved in the control of flowering time and plant height in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Flowering time and plant height are important agronomic traits for crop production. In this study, we characterized a semi-dwarf and late flowering (dlf1) mutation of rice that has pleiotropic effects on these traits. The dlf1 mutation was caused by a T-DNA insertion and the cloned Dlf1 gene was found to encode a WRKY transcription factor (OsWRKY11). The dlf1 mutant contains a T-DNA insertion at the promoter region, leading to enhanced accumulation of Dlf1 transcripts, resulting in a semidominant mutation. The dlf1 mutation suppressed the transcription of Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 and its downstream flowering-time genes including Hd1, Ehd1 and Hd3a under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knock-down of Dlf1 expression exhibited early flowering at LD condition related to the wild-type plants. Accumulation of Dlf1 mRNA was observed in most tissues, and two splicing forms of Dlf1 cDNAs were obtained (OsWRKY11.1 and OsWRKY11.2). These two proteins showed transactivation activity in yeast cells. Dlf1 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus. Enhanced expression of OsWRKY11.2 or its 5' truncated gene showed similar phenotypes to the dlf1 mutant, suggesting that it might function as a negative regulator. We conclude that Dlf1 acts as a transactivator to downregulate Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 in the signal transduction pathway of flowering and plays an important role in the regulation of plant height in rice.
25001222	Molecular identification and interaction assay of the gene (OsUbc13) encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in rice.	2014	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	The ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13, has been known to be involved in error-free DNA damage tolerance (or post-replication repair) via catalyzing Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains formation together with a Ubc variant. However, its functions remain largely unknown in plant species, especially in monocotyledons. In this study, we cloned a Ub-conjugating enzyme, OsUbc13, that shares the conserved domain of Ubc with AtUBC13B in Oryza sativa L., which encodes a protein of 153 amino acids; the deduced sequence shares high similarities with other homologs. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that OsUbc13 transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined, and the expression level was higher in palea, pistil, stamen, and leaf, and lower in root, stem, and lemma; the expression of OsUbc13 was induced by low temperature, methylmethane sulfate (MMS), and H(2)O(2), but repressed by mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA), and NaCl. OsUbc13 was probably localized in the plasma and nuclear membranes. About 20 proteins, which are responsible for the positive yeast two-hybrid interaction of OsUbc13, were identified. These include the confirmed OsVDAC (correlated with apoptosis), OsMADS1 (important for development of ﬂoral organs), OsB22EL8 (related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA protection), and OsCROC-1 (required for formation of Lys63 polyubiquitylation and error-free DNA damage tolerance). The molecular characterization provides a foundation for the functional study of OsUbc13.
24995795	The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) are important phytohormones for controlling lamina inclination implicated in plant architecture and grain yield. But the molecular mechanism of auxin and BR crosstalk for regulating lamina inclination remains unknown. Auxin response factors (ARFs) control various aspects of plant growth and development. We here report that OsARF19-overexpression rice lines show an enlarged lamina inclination due to increase of its adaxial cell division. OsARF19 is expressed in various organs including lamina joint and strongly induced by auxin and BR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression. OsGH3-5-overexpression lines show a similar phenotype as OsARF19-O1. Free auxin contents in the lamina joint of OsGH3-5-O1 or OsARF19-O1 are reduced. OsGH3-5 is localized at the endoplasmic retieulum (ER) matching reduction of the free auxin contents in OsGH3-5-O1. osarf19-TDNA and osgh3-5-Tos17 mutants without erected leaves show a function redundancy with other members of their gene family. OsARF19-overexpression lines are sensitive to exogenous BR treatment and alter the expressions of genes related to BR signalling. These findings provide novel insights into auxin and BR signalling, and might have significant implications for improving plant architecture of monocot crops.
25081037	OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d and induces reactive oxygen species and leaf senescence in rice.	2014	Mol Cells	We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) WRKY gene which is highly upregulated in senescent leaves, denoted OsWRKY42. Analysis of OsWRKY42-GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor. OsWRKY42-overexpressing (OsWR KY42OX) transgenic rice plants exhibited an early leaf senescence phenotype with accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and a reduced chlorophyll content. Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants. An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY42 binds to the W-box of the OsMT1d promoter. Our results thus suggest that OsWRKY42 represses OsMT1d-mediated ROS scavenging and thereby promotes leaf senescence in rice.
24980160	Isolation and functional characterization of a novel rice constitutive promoter.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A novel rice constitutive promoter (P OsCon1 ) was isolated. The molecular mechanism of the promoter activity was investigated. P OsCon1 could be used as an alternative constitutive promoter for crop transgenic engineering. Monocot constitutive promoter is an important resource for crop transgenic engineering. In this report, we isolated a novel promoter, Oscon1 promoter (P OsCon1 ), from the 5' upstream region of a constitutively expressed rice gene OsDHAR1. In P OsCon1 ::GUS transgenic rice, we showed that P OsCon1 had a broad expression spectrum in all tested tissues. The expression of the promoter was further analyzed in comparison with the previously characterized strong constitutive promoters. P OsCon1 exhibited comparable activity to OsCc1, OsAct1 or ZmUbi promoters in most tissues, and more active than 35S promoter in roots, seeds, and calli. Further quantitative assays indicated that P OsCon1 activity was not affected by developmental stages or by environmental factors. Further, 5'-deletions analysis indicated that the distinct regions might contribute to the strong expression of P OsCon1 in different tissues. Overall, our results suggest that P OsCon1 is a novel constitutive promoter, which could potentially use in transgenic crop development.
25052102	Modulation of amylose content by structure-based modification of OsGBSS1 activity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	The rice Waxy (Wx) gene encodes granule-bound starch synthase 1 (EC 2.4.1.242), OsGBSS1, which is responsible for amylose synthesis in rice seed endosperm. In this study, we determined the functional contribution of eight amino acids on the activity of OsGBSS1 by introducing site-directed mutated Wx gene constructs into the wx mutant glutinous rice. The eight amino acid residues are suspected to play roles in OsGBSS1 structure maintenance or function based on homologous enzyme sequence alignment and homology modelling. Both OsGBSS1 activity and amylose content were analysed in homozygous transgenic lines carrying the mutated OsGBSS1 (Wx) genes. Our results indicate that mutations at diverse sites in OsGBSS1 reduces its activity by affecting its starch-binding capacity, its ADP-glucose-binding capability or its protein stability. Our results shed new light on the structural basis of OsGBSS1 activity and the mechanisms of OsGBSS1 activity on amylose synthesis in vivo. This study also demonstrates that it is feasible to finely modulate amylose content in rice grains by modifying the OsGBSS1 activity.
25089878	The mitochondrion-located protein OsB12D1 enhances flooding tolerance during seed germination and early seedling growth in rice.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	B12D belongs to a function unknown subgroup of the Balem (Barley aleurone and embryo) proteins. In our previous work on rice seed germination, we identified a B12D-like protein encoded by LOC_Os7g41350 (named OsB12D1). OsB12D1 pertains to an ancient protein family with an amino acid sequence highly conserved from moss to angiosperms. Among the six OsB12Ds, OsB12D1 is one of the major transcripts and is primarily expressed in germinating seed and root. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that OsB12D1 is an anoxic or submergence resistance-related gene. RT-PCR results showed OsB12D1 is induced remarkably in the coleoptiles or roots by flooding during seed germination and early seedling growth. The OsB12D1-overexpressed rice seeds could protrude radicles in 8 cm deep water, further exhibiting significant flooding tolerance compared to the wild type. Moreover, this tolerance was not affected by the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol. OsB12D1 was identified in the mitochondrion by subcellular localization analysis and possibly enhances electron transport through mediating Fe and oxygen availability under flooded conditions. This work indicated that OsB12D1 is a promising gene that can help to enhance rice seedling establishment in farming practices, especially for direct seeding.
25079308	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of a major QTL for panicle structure in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A gene not only control tiller and plant height, but also regulate panicle structure by QTL dissection in rice. An ideal panicle structure is important for improvement of plant architecture and rice yield. In this study, using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of PA64s and 93-11, we identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL), designated qPPB3 for primary panicle branch number. With a BC3F2 population derived from a backcross between a resequenced RIL carrying PA64s allele and 93-11, qPPB3 was fine mapped to a 34.6-kb genomic region. Gene prediction analysis identified four putative genes, among which Os03g0203200, a previously reported gene for plant height and tiller number, Dwarf 88 (D88)/Dwarf 14 (D14), had three nucleotide substitutions in 93-11 compared with PA64s. The T to G substitution resulted in one amino acid change from valine in 93-11 to glycine in PA64s. Real-time PCR analysis showed expression level of D88 was higher in 93-11 than PA64s. The expression of APO1 and IPA1 increased, while GN1a and DST decreased in 93-11 compared with PA64s. Therefore, D88/D14 is not only a key regulator for branching, but also affects panicle structure.
24985152	Functional analysis of COP1 and SPA orthologs from Physcomitrella and rice during photomorphogenesis of transgenic Arabidopsis reveals distinct evolutionary conservation.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Plants have evolved light sensing mechanisms to optimally adapt their growth and development to the ambient light environment. The COP1/SPA complex is a key negative regulator of light signaling in the well-studied dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. COP1 and members of the four SPA proteins are part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts in darkness to ubiquitinate several transcription factors involved in light responses, thereby targeting them for degradation by the proteasome. While COP1 is also found in humans, SPA proteins appear specific to plants. Here, we have functionally addressed evolutionary conservation of COP1 and SPA orthologs from the moss Physcomitrella, the monocot rice and the dicot Arabidopsis.

RESULTS: To this end, we analyzed the activities of COP1- and SPA-like proteins from Physcomitrella patens and rice when expressed in Arabidopsis. Expression of rice COP1 and Physcomitrella COP1 protein sequences predominantly complemented all phenotypic aspects of the viable, hypomorphic cop1-4 mutant and the null, seedling-lethal cop1-5 mutant of Arabidopsis: rice COP1 fully rescued the constitutive-photomorphogenesis phenotype in darkness and the leaf expansion defect of cop1 mutants, while it partially restored normal photoperiodic flowering in cop1. Physcomitrella COP1 partially restored normal seedling growth and flowering time, while it fully restored normal leaf expansion in the cop1 mutants. In contrast, expression of a SPA ortholog from Physcomitrella (PpSPAb) in Arabidopsis spa mutants did not rescue any facet of the spa mutant phenotype, suggesting that the PpSPAb protein is not functionally conserved or that the Arabidopsis function evolved after the split of mosses and seed plants. The SPA1 ortholog from rice (OsSPA1) rescued the spa mutant phenotype in dark-grown seedlings, but did not complement any spa mutant phenotype in light-grown seedlings or in adult plants.

CONCLUSION: Our results show that COP1 protein sequences from Physcomitrella, rice and Arabidopsis have been functionally conserved during evolution, while the SPA proteins showed considerable functional divergence. This may - at least in part - reflect the fact that COP1 is a single copy gene in seed plants, while SPA proteins are encoded by a small gene family of two to four members with possibly sub- or neofunctionalized tasks.
24989161	BeMADS1 is a key to delivery MADSs into nucleus in reproductive tissues-De novo characterization of Bambusa edulis transcriptome and study of MADS genes in bamboo floral development.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The bamboo Bambusa edulis has a long juvenile phase in situ, but can be induced to flower during in vitro tissue culture, providing a readily available source of material for studies on reproductive biology and flowering. In this report, in vitro-derived reproductive and vegetative materials of B. edulis were harvested and used to generate transcriptome databases by use of two sequencing platforms: Illumina and 454. Combination of the two datasets resulted in high transcriptome quality and increased length of the sequence reads. In plants, many MADS genes control flower development, and the ABCDE model has been developed to explain how the genes function together to create the different whorls within a flower.

RESULTS: As a case study, published floral development-related OsMADS proteins from rice were used to search the B. edulis transcriptome datasets, identifying 16 B. edulis MADS (BeMADS). The BeMADS gene expression levels were determined qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Most BeMADS genes were highly expressed in flowers, with the exception of BeMADS34. The expression patterns of these genes were most similar to the rice homologs, except BeMADS18 and BeMADS34, and were highly similar to the floral development ABCDE model in rice. Transient expression of MADS-GFP proteins showed that only BeMADS1 entered leaf nucleus. BeMADS18, BeMADS4, and BeMADS1 were located in the lemma nucleus. When co-transformed with BeMADS1, BeMADS15, 16, 13, 21, 6, and 7 translocated to nucleus in lemmas, indicating that BeMADS1 is a key factor for subcellular localization of other BeMADS.

CONCLUSION: Our study provides abundant B. edulis transcriptome data and offers comprehensive sequence resources. The results, molecular materials and overall strategy reported here can be used for future gene identification and for further reproductive studies in the economically important crop of bamboo.
25002225	Expression of a gene encoding a rice RING zinc-finger protein, OsRZFP34, enhances stomata opening.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	By oligo microarray expression profiling, we identified a rice RING zinc-finger protein (RZFP), OsRZFP34, whose gene expression increased with high temperature or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. As compared with the wild type, rice and Arabidopsis with OsRZFP34 overexpression showed increased relative stomata opening even with ABA treatment. Furthermore, loss-of-function mutation of OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34 (At5g22920), an OsRZFP34 homolog in Arabidopsis, decreased relative stomata aperture under nonstress control conditions. Expressing OsRZFP34 in atrzfp34 reverted the mutant phenotype to normal, which indicates a conserved molecular function between OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34. Analysis of water loss and leaf temperature under stress conditions revealed a higher evaporation rate and cooling effect in OsRZFP34-overexpressing Arabidopsis and rice than the wild type, atrzfp34 and osrzfp34. Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression. Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRZFP34 revealed many genes involved in OsRZFP34-mediated stomatal movement. Several genes upregulated or downregulated in OsRZFP34-overexpressing plants were previously implicated in Ca(2+) sensing, K(+) regulator, and ABA response. We suggest that OsRZFP34 may modulate these genes to control stomata opening.
24923192	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis.	2014	Plant J	Seed shattering is an important trait that influences grain yield. A major controlling quantitative trait locus in rice is qSH1. Although the degree of shattering is correlated with the level of expression of qSH1, some qSH1-defective cultivars display moderate shattering while others show a non-shattering phenotype. Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1. Although we detected SH5 transcripts in various organs, this gene was highly expressed at the abscission zone (AZ) in the pedicels. When expression of this gene was suppressed in easy-shattering 'Kasalath', development of the AZ was reduced and thereby so was seed loss. By contrast, the extent of shattering, as well as AZ development, was greatly enhanced in moderate-shattering 'Dongjin' rice when SH5 was overexpressed. Likewise, overexpression of SH5 in the non-shattering 'Ilpum' led to an increase in seed shattering because lignin levels were decreased in the basal region of spikelets in the absence of development of an AZ. We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5. Based on these observations, we propose that SH5 modulates seed shattering by enhancing AZ development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis.
24947012	Transport of rice cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase into mitochondria relies on a targeting sequence located in its C-terminal internal region.	2014	Plant J	The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), which represents a major type of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, is a principal cause of UVB-induced growth inhibition in plants. CPD photolyase is the primary enzyme for repairing CPDs and is crucial for determining the sensitivity of Oryza sativa (rice) to UVB radiation. CPD photolyase is widely distributed among species ranging from eubacteria to eukaryotes, and is classified into class I or II based on its primary structure. We previously demonstrated that rice CPD photolyase (OsPHR), which belongs to class II and is encoded by a single-copy gene, is a unique nuclear/mitochondrial/chloroplast triple-targeting protein; however, the location and nature of the organellar targeting information contained within OsPHR are unknown. Here, the nuclear and mitochondrial targeting signal sequences of OsPHR were identified by systematic deletion analysis. The nuclear and mitochondrial targeting sequences are harbored within residues 487-489 and 391-401 in the C-terminal region of OsPHR (506 amino acid residues), respectively. The mitochondrial targeting signal represents a distinct topogenic sequence that differs structurally and functionally from classical N-terminal pre-sequences, and this region, in addition to its role in localization to the mitochondria, is essential for the proper functioning of the CPD photolyase. Furthermore, the mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is characteristic of class-II CPD photolyases, was acquired before the divergence of class-II CPD photolyases in eukaryotes. These results indicate that rice plants have evolved a CPD photolyase that functions in mitochondria to protect cells from the harmful effects of UVB radiation.
25157897	Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.	2014	PLoS One	Phytoalexins are specialised antimicrobial metabolites that are produced by plants in response to pathogen attack. Momilactones and phytocassanes are the major diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice and are synthesised from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which is derived from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. The hyperaccumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes due to the hyperinductive expression of the relevant biosynthetic genes and the MEP pathway gene OsDXS3 in OsTGAP1-overexpressing (OsTGAP1ox) rice cells has previously been shown to be stimulated by the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. In this study, to clarify the mechanisms of the elicitor-stimulated coordinated hyperinduction of these phytoalexin biosynthetic genes in OsTGAP1ox cells, transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing were performed, resulting in the identification of 122 OsTGAP1 target genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that nearly all of the momilactone and phytocassane biosynthetic genes, which are clustered on chromosomes 4 and 2, respectively, and the MEP pathway genes were hyperinductively expressed in the elicitor-stimulated OsTGAP1ox cells. Unexpectedly, none of the clustered genes was included among the OsTGAP1 target genes, suggesting that OsTGAP1 did not directly regulate the expression of these biosynthetic genes through binding to each promoter region. Interestingly, however, several OsTGAP1-binding regions were found in the intergenic regions among and near the cluster regions. Concerning the MEP pathway genes, only OsDXS3, which encodes a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, possessed an OsTGAP1-binding region in its upstream region. A subsequent transactivation assay further confirmed the direct regulation of OsDXS3 expression by OsTGAP1, but other MEP pathway genes were not included among the OsTGAP1 target genes. Collectively, these results suggest that OsTGAP1 participates in the enhanced accumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins, primarily through mechanisms other than the direct transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of these phytoalexins.
25157029	The role of a potassium transporter OsHAK5 in potassium acquisition and transport from roots to shoots in rice at low potassium supply levels.	2014	Plant Physiol	In plants, K transporter (KT)/high affinity K transporter (HAK)/K uptake permease (KUP) is the largest potassium (K) transporter family; however, few of the members have had their physiological functions characterized in planta. Here, we studied OsHAK5 of the KT/HAK/KUP family in rice (Oryza sativa). We determined its cellular and tissue localization and analyzed its functions in rice using both OsHAK5 knockout mutants and overexpression lines in three genetic backgrounds. A β-glucuronidase reporter driven by the OsHAK5 native promoter indicated OsHAK5 expression in various tissue organs from root to seed, abundantly in root epidermis and stele, the vascular tissues, and mesophyll cells. Net K influx rate in roots and K transport from roots to aerial parts were severely impaired by OsHAK5 knockout but increased by OsHAK5 overexpression in 0.1 and 0.3 mm K external solution. The contribution of OsHAK5 to K mobilization within the rice plant was confirmed further by the change of K concentration in the xylem sap and K distribution in the transgenic lines when K was removed completely from the external solution. Overexpression of OsHAK5 increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of OsHAK5 decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsHAK5 plays a major role in K acquisition by roots faced with low external K and in K upward transport from roots to shoots in K-deficient rice plants.
25219319	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been implicated in signal transduction of both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In this study, we found that the transcript of a rice (Oryza sativa) MAPKK (OsMKK1) was markedly increased by salt stress. By examining the survival rate and Na(+) content in shoot, we found that OsMKK1-knockout (osmkk1) mutant was more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type. OsMKK1 activity in the wild-type seedlings and protoplasts was increased by salt stress. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4. OsMPK4 activity was increased by salt, which was impaired in osmkk1 plants. In contrast, overexpression of OsMKK1 increased OsMPK4 activity in protoplasts. By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3. Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice.
25107532	Diversity of reaction characteristics of glucan branching enzymes and the fine structure of α-glucan from various sources.	2014	Arch Biochem Biophys	To investigate the functional properties of 10 α-glucan branching enzymes (BEs) from various sources, we determined the chain-length distribution of BE enzymatic products and their phosphorylase-limit dextrins (Φ-LD). All BEs could be classified into either of the three rice BE isozymes: OsBEI, OsBEIIa, or OsBEIIb. Escherichia coli BE (EcoBE) had the same enzymatic properties as OsBEI, while Synechococcus elongatus BE (ScoBE) and Chlorella kessleri BE (ChlBE) had BEIIb-type properties. Human BE (HosBE), yeast BE (SacBE), and two Porphyridium purpureum BEs (PopBE1 and PopBE2) exhibited the OsBEIIa-type properties. Analysis of chain-length profile of Φ-LD of the BE reaction products revealed that EcoBE, ScoBE, PopBE1, and PopBE2 preferred A-chains as acceptors, while OsBEIIb used B-chains more frequently than A-chains. Both EcoBE and ScoBE specifically formed the branch linkages at the third glucose residue from the reducing end of the acceptor chain. The present results provide evidence for the first time that great variation exists as to the preference of BEs for their acceptor chain, either A-chain or B-chain. In addition, EcoBE and ScoBE recognize the location of branching points in their acceptor chain during their branching reaction. Nevertheless, no correlation exists between the primary structure of BE proteins and their enzymatic characteristics.
25150410	RNAi-directed downregulation of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (OsBADH1) results in decreased stress tolerance and increased oxidative markers without affecting glycine betaine biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Plant Mol Biol	As an important osmoprotectant, glycine betaine (GB) plays an essential role in resistance to abiotic stress in a variety of organisms, including rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, GB content is too low to be detectable in rice, although rice genome possesses several orthologs coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) involved in plant GB biosynthesis. Rice BADH1 (OsBADH1) has been shown to be targeted to peroxisome and its overexpression resulted in increased GB biosynthesis and tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of OsBADH1 in stress tolerance without altering GB biosynthesis capacity, using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. OsBADH1 was ubiquitously expressed in different organs, including roots, stems, leaves and flowers. Transgenic rice lines downregulating OsBADH1 exhibited remarkably reduced tolerance to NaCl, drought and cold stresses. The decrease of stress tolerance occurring in the OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines was associated with an elevated level of malondialdehyde content and hydrogen peroxidation. No GB accumulation was detected in transgene-positive and transgene-negative lines derived from heterozygous transgenic T0 plants. Moreover, transgenic OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines showed significantly reduced seed set and yield. In conclusion, the downregulation of OsBADH1, even though not causing any change of GB content, was accounted for the reduction of ability to dehydrogenate the accumulating metabolism-derived aldehydes and subsequently resulted in decreased stress tolerance and crop productivity. These results suggest that OsBADH1 possesses an enzyme activity to catalyze other aldehydes in addition to betaine aldehyde (the precursor of GB) and thus alleviate their toxic effects under abiotic stresses.
25128531	The crystal structure of the plant small GTPase OsRac1 reveals its mode of binding to NADPH oxidase.	2014	J Biol Chem	Rac/Rop proteins are Rho-type small GTPases that act as molecular switches in plants. Recent studies have identified these proteins as key components in many major plant signaling pathways, such as innate immunity, pollen tube growth, and root hair formation. In rice, the Rac/Rop protein OsRac1 plays an important role in regulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB during innate immunity. However, the molecular mechanism by which OsRac1 regulates OsRbohB remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of OsRac1 complexed with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate at 1.9 Å resolution; this represents the first active-form structure of a plant small GTPase. To elucidate the ROS production in rice cells, structural information was used to design OsRac1 mutants that displayed reduced binding to OsRbohB. Only mutations in the OsRac1 Switch I region showed attenuated interactions with OsRbohB in vitro. In particular, Tyr(39) and Asp(45) substitutions suppressed ROS production in rice cells, indicating that these residues are critical for interaction with and activation of OsRbohB. Structural comparison of active-form OsRac1 with AtRop9 in its GDP-bound inactive form showed a large conformational difference in the vicinity of these residues. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the immune response through OsRac1 and the various cellular responses associated with plant Rac/Rop proteins.
25113543	Molecular characterization of rice sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene OsSPL1 and functional analysis of its role in disease resistance response.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Our results indicate that overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants attenuated disease resistance and facilitated programmed cell death. Long-chain base phosphates including sphingosine-1-phosphate have been shown to act as signaling mediators in regulating programmed cell death (PCD) and stress responses in mammals. In the present study, we characterized a rice gene OsSPL1, encoding a putative sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase that is involved in metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Expression of OsSPL1 was down-regulated in rice plants after treatments with salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but was induced by infection with a virulent strain of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Transgenic tobacco lines with overexpression of OsSPL1 were generated and analyzed for the possible role of OsSPL1 in disease resistance response and PCD. The OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants displayed increased susceptibility to infection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Pst), the causal agent of wildfire disease, showing severity of disease symptom and bacterial titers in inoculated leaves, and attenuated pathogen-induced expression of PR genes after infection of Pst as compared to the wild-type and vector-transformed plants. Higher level of cell death, as revealed by dead cell staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes, was observed in the OsSPL1-overexpressing plants after treatment with fumonisin B1, a fungal toxin that induces PCD in plants. Our results suggest that OsSPL1 has different functions in regulating disease resistance response and PCD in plants.
25039836	A glutathione responsive rice glyoxalase II, OsGLYII-2, functions in salinity adaptation by maintaining better photosynthesis efficiency and anti-oxidant pool.	2014	Plant J	Glyoxalase II (GLY II), the second enzyme of glyoxalase pathway that detoxifies cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MG), belongs to the superfamily of metallo-β-lactamases. Here, detailed analysis of one of the uncharacterized rice glyoxalase II family members, OsGLYII-2 was conducted in terms of its metal content, enzyme kinetics and stress tolerance potential. Functional complementation of yeast GLY II mutant (∆GLO2) and enzyme kinetics data suggested that OsGLYII-2 possesses characteristic GLY II activity using S-lactoylglutathione (SLG) as the substrate. Further, Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission spectroscopy and modelled structure revealed that OsGLYII-2 contains a binuclear Zn/Fe centre in its active site and chelation studies indicated that these are essential for its activity. Interestingly, reconstitution of chelated enzyme with Zn(2+), and/or Fe(2+) could not reactivate the enzyme, while addition of Co(2+) was able to do so. End product inhibition study provides insight into the kinetics of GLY II enzyme and assigns hitherto unknown function to reduced glutathione (GSH). Ectopic expression of OsGLYII-2 in Escherichia coli and tobacco provides improved tolerance against salinity and dicarbonyl stress indicating towards its role in abiotic stress tolerance. Maintained levels of MG and GSH as well as better photosynthesis rate and reduced oxidative damage in transgenic plants under stress conditions seems to be the possible mechanism facilitating enhanced stress tolerance.
25173451	Molecular dissection of the response of a rice leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) gene to abiotic stresses.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase (RLK) proteins play key roles in a variety of biological pathways. In a previous study, we analyzed the members of the rice LRR-RLK gene family using in silico analysis. A total of 23 LRR-RLK genes were selected based on the expression patterns of a genome-wide dataset of microarrays. The Oryza sativa gamma-ray induced LRR-RLK1 (OsGIRL1) gene was highly induced by gamma irradiation. Therefore, we studied its expression pattern in response to various different abiotic and phytohormone treatments. OsGIRL1 was induced on exposure to abiotic stresses such as salt, osmotic, and heat, salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA), but exhibited downregulation in response to jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. The OsGIRL1 protein was clearly localized at the plasma membrane. The truncated proteins harboring juxtamembrane and kinase domains (or only harboring a kinase domain) exhibited strong autophosphorylation. The biological function of OsGIRL1 was investigated via heterologous overexpression of this gene in Arabidopsis plants subjected to gamma-ray irradiation, salt stress, osmotic stress, and heat stress. A hypersensitive response was observed in response to salt stress and heat stress, whereas a hyposensitive response was observed in response to gamma-ray treatment and osmotic stress. These results provide critical insights into the molecular functions of the rice LRR-RLK genes as receptors of external signals.
25219312	Expression and enzymatic properties of rice (Oryza sativa L.) monolignol β-glucosidases.	2014	Plant Sci	Monolignol glucosides and their β-glucosidases are found in monocots, but their biological roles are unclear. Phylogenetic analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) glycoside hydrolase family GH1 β-glucosidases indicated that Os4BGlu14, Os4BGlu16, and Os4BGlu18 are closely related to known monolignol β-glucosidases. An optimized Os4BGlu16 cDNA and cloned Os4BGlu18 cDNA were used to express fusion proteins with His6 tags in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli, respectively. The secreted Os4BGlu16 fusion protein was purified from media by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), while Os4BGlu18 was extracted from E. coli cells and purified by anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and IMAC. Os4BGlu16 and Os4BGlu18 hydrolyzed the monolignol glucosides coniferin (kcat/KM, 21.6mM(-1)s(-1) for Os4BGlu16 and for Os4BGlu18) and syringin (kcat/KM, 22.8mM(-1)s(-1) for Os4BGlu16 and 24.0mM(-1)s(-1) for Os4BGlu18) with much higher catalytic efficiencies than other substrates. In quantitative RT-PCR, highest Os4BGlu14 mRNA levels were detected in endosperm, embryo, lemma, panicle and pollen. Os4BGlu16 was detected highest in leaf from 4 to 10 weeks, endosperm and lemma, while Os4BGlu18 mRNA was most abundant in vegetative stage from 1 week to 4 weeks, pollen and lemma. These data suggest a role for Os4BGlu16 and Os4BGlu18 monolignol β-glucosidases in both vegetative and reproductive rice tissues.
25195901	Purification, characterization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of monodehydroascorbate reductase from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2014	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is a key enzyme in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification system of plants. The participation of MDHAR in ascorbate (AsA) recycling in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle is important in the acquired tolerance of crop plants to abiotic environmental stresses. Thus, MDHAR represents a strategic target protein for the improvement of crop yields. Although physiological studies have intensively characterized MDHAR, a structure-based functional analysis is not available. Here, a cytosolic MDHAR (OsMDHAR) derived from Oryza sativa L. japonica was expressed using Escherichia coli strain NiCo21 (DE3) and purified. The purified OsMDHAR showed specific enzyme activity (approximately 380 U per milligram of protein) and was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at pH 8.0 and 298 K. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit (the Matthews coefficient VM is 1.98 Å(3) Da(-1), corresponding to a solvent content of 38.06%) in space group P41212 with unit-cell parameters a = b = 81.89, c = 120.4 Å. The phase of the OsMDHAR structure was resolved by the molecular-replacement method using a ferredoxin reductase from Acidovorax sp. strain KKS102 (PDB entry 4h4q) as a model.
25151129	Rice serine/threonine kinase 1 is required for the stimulation of OsNug2 GTPase activity.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Several GTPases are required for ribosome biogenesis and assembly. We recently identified rice (Oryza sativa) nuclear/nucleolar GTPase 2 (OsNug2), a YlqF/YawG family GTPase, as having a role in pre-60S ribosomal subunit maturation. To investigate the potential factors involved in regulating OsNug2 function, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using OsNug2 as bait. Rice serine/threonine kinase 1 (OsSTK1) was identified as a candidate interacting protein. OsSTK1 appeared to interact with OsNug2 both in vitro and in vivo. OsSTK1 was found to have no effect on the GTP-binding activity of OsNug2; however, the presence of recombinant OsSTK1 in OsNug2 assay reaction mixtures increased OsNug2 GTPase activity. A kinase assay showed that OsSTK1 had weak autophosphorylation activity and strongly phosphorylated serine 209 of OsNug2. Using yeast complementation testing, we identified a GAL::OsNug2(S209N) mutation-harboring yeast strain that exhibited a growth-defective phenotype on galactose medium at 39°C, which was divergent from that of a yeast strain harboring GAL::OsNug2. The intrinsic GTPase activity of OsNug2(S209N), which was found to be similar to that of OsNug2, was not fully enhanced upon weak binding of OsSTK1. Our findings indicate that OsSTK1 functions as a positive regulator of OsNug2 by enhancing OsNug2 GTPase activity. In addition, phosphorylation of OsNug2 serine 209 is essential for its complete function in biological functional pathway.
25096923	Post-translational regulation of rice MADS29 function: homodimerization or binary interactions with other seed-expressed MADS proteins modulate its translocation into the nucleus.	2014	J Exp Bot	OsMADS29 is a seed-specific MADS-box transcription factor that affects embryo development and grain filling by maintaining hormone homeostasis and degradation of cells in the nucellus and nucellar projection. Although it has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, the transiently expressed OsMADS29 monomer does not localize specifically in the nucleus. Dimerization of the monomers alters the intracellular localization fate of the resulting OsMADS29 homodimer, which then translocates into the nucleus. By generating domain-specific deletions/mutations, we show that two conserved amino acids (lysine(23) and arginine(24)) in the NLS are important for nuclear localization of the OsMADS29 homodimer. Furthermore, the analyses involving interaction of OsMADS29 with 30 seed-expressed rice MADS proteins revealed 19 more MADS-box proteins, including five E-class proteins, which interacted with OsMADS29. Eleven of these complexes were observed to be localized in the nucleus. Deletion analysis revealed that the KC region (K-box and C-terminal domain) plays a pivotal role in homodimerization. These data suggest that the biological function of OsMADS29 may not only be regulated at the level of transcription and translation as reported earlier, but also at the post-translational level by way of the interaction between OsMADS29 monomers, and between OsMADS29 and other MADS-box proteins.
25103621	Induction of caspase-3-like activity in rice following release of cytochrome-f from the chloroplast and subsequent interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasome system.	2014	Sci Rep	It has been known that the process of leaf senescence is accompanied by programmed cell death (PCD), and the previous study indicated that dark-induced senescence in detached leaves from rice led to the release of cytochrome f (Cyt f) from chloroplast into the cytoplasm. In this study, the effects of Cyt f on PCD were studied both in vitro and in vivo. In a cell-free system, purified Cyt f activated caspase-3-like protease and endonuclease OsNuc37, and induced DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, Cyt f-induced caspase-3-like activity could be inhibited by MG132, which suggests that the activity was attributed to the 26S proteasome. Conditional expression of Cyt f in the cytoplasm could also activate caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation. Fluorescein diacetate staining and annexin V-FITC/PI double staining demonstrated that Cyt f expression in cytoplasm significantly increased the percentage of PCD protoplasts. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Cyt f might interact with E3-ubiquitin ligase and RPN9b, the subunits of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and other PCD-related proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that the released Cyt f from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm might activate or rescue caspase-3-like activity by interacting with the UPS, ultimately leading to the induction of PCD.
25099245	Immunotoxicity assessment of rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	2014	PLoS One	Human serum albumin (HSA) is extensively used in clinics to treat a variety of diseases, such as hypoproteinemia, hemorrhagic shock, serious burn injuries, cirrhotic ascites and fetal erythroblastosis. To address supply shortages and high safety risks from limited human donors, we recently developed recombinant technology to produce HSA from rice endosperm. To assess the risk potential of HSA derived from Oryza sativa (OsrHSA) before a First-in-human (FIH) trial, we compared OsrHSA and plasma-derived HSA (pHSA), evaluating the potential for an immune reaction and toxicity using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The results indicated that neither OsrHSA nor pHSA stimulated T cell proliferation at 1x and 5x dosages. We also found no significant differences in the profiles of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets between OsrHSA- and pHSA-treated cells. Furthermore, the results showed that there were no significant differences between OsrHSA and pHSA in the production of cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4. Our results demonstrated that OsrHSA has equivalent immunotoxicity to pHSA when using the PBMC model. Moreover, this ex vivo system could provide an alternative approach to predict potential risks in novel biopharmaceutical development.
25098603	Selection and molecular characterization of a high tocopherol accumulation rice mutant line induced by gamma irradiation.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Tocopherols are micronutrients with antioxidant properties. They are synthesized by photosynthetic bacteria and plants, and play important roles in animal and human nutrition. In this study, we isolated a new rice mutant line with elevated tocopherol content (MRXII) from an in vitro mutagenized population induced by gamma irradiation. The mutant exhibited greater seed longevity than the control, indicating a crucial role for tocopherols in maintaining viability during quiescence, and displayed faster seedling growth during the early growth stage. To study the molecular mechanism underlying vitamin E biosynthesis, we examined the expression patterns of seven rice genes encoding vitamin E biosynthetic enzymes. Accumulation levels of the OsVTE2 transcript and OsVTE2 protein in the MRXII mutant were significantly higher than in the control. Sequence analysis revealed that the MRXII mutant harbored a point mutation in the OsVTE2 promoter region, which resulted in the generation of MYB transcription factor-binding cis-element. These results help identify the promoter regions that regulate OsVTE2 transcription, and offer insights into the regulation of tocopherol content.
25151617	Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	As a member of the heavy metal ATPase (HMA) family, OsHMA3 is a tonoplast-localized transporter for Cd in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain. Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd. The growth of both the roots and shoots was similar in the absence of Cd between an OsHMA3-overexpressed line and vector control, but the Cd-inhibited growth was significantly alleviated in the OsHMA3-overexpressed line. The overexpressed line showed higher Cd concentration in the roots, but lower Cd concentration in the shoots compared with the wild-type rice and vector control line, indicating that overexpression of OsHMA3 enhanced vacuolar sequestration of Cd in the roots. The Zn concentration in the roots of the OsHMA3-overexpressed line was constantly higher than that of vector control, but the Zn concentration in the shoots was similar between the overexpressed line and vector control. Five transporter genes belonging to the ZIP family were constitutively up-regulated in the OsHMA3-overexpressed line. These results suggest that shoot Zn level was maintained by up-regulating these genes involved in the Zn uptake/translocation. Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice.
25146897	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Jasmonic acid (JA) functions in plant development, including senescence and immunity. Arabidopsis thaliana CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 encodes a JA receptor and functions in the JA-responsive signaling pathway. The Arabidopsis genome harbors a single COI gene, but the rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbors three COI homologs, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2. Thus, it remains unclear whether each OsCOI has distinct, additive, synergistic, or redundant functions in development. Here, we use the oscoi1b-1 knockout mutants to show that OsCOI1b mainly affects leaf senescence under senescence-promoting conditions. oscoi1b-1 mutants stayed green during dark-induced and natural senescence, with substantial retention of chlorophylls and photosynthetic capacity. Furthermore, several senescence-associated genes were downregulated in oscoi1b-1 mutants, including homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 and ORESARA 1, important regulators of leaf senescence. These results suggest that crosstalk between JA signaling and ethylene signaling affects leaf senescence. The Arabidopsis coi1-1 plants containing 35S:OsCOI1a or 35S:OsCOI1b rescued the delayed leaf senescence during dark incubation, suggesting that both OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b are required for promoting leaf senescence in rice. oscoi1b-1 mutants showed significant decreases in spikelet fertility and grain weight, leading to severe reduction of grain yield, indicating that OsCOI1-mediated JA signaling affects spikelet fertility and grain filling.
24759811	Se14, encoding a JmjC domain-containing protein, plays key roles in long-day suppression of rice flowering through the demethylation of H3K4me3 of RFT1.	2014	PLoS One	Floral transition from the vegetative to the reproductive growth phase is a major change in the plant life cycle and a key factor in reproductive success. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a facultative short-day plant, numerous flowering time and flower formation genes that control floral transition have been identified and their physiological effects and biochemical functions have been clarified. In the present study, we used a Se14-deficient mutant line (HS112) and other flowering mutant lines to investigate the photoperiodic response, chromosomal location and function in the photoperiod sensitivity of the Se14 gene. We also studied the interactive effects of this locus with other crucial flowering time genes. We found that Se14 is independent of the known photoperiod-sensitive genes, such as Hd1 and Ghd7, and is identical to Os03g0151300, which encodes a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein. Expression analysis revealed that the expressions of RFT1, a floral initiator known as a "florigen-like gene", and Ehd1 were up-regulated in HS112, whereas this up-regulation was not observed in the original variety of 'Gimbozu'. ChIP assays of the methylation states of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) revealed that the trimethylated H3K4 in the promoter region of the RFT1 chromatin was significantly increased in HS112. We conclude that Se14 is a novel photoperiod-sensitivity gene that has a suppressive effect on floral transition (flowering time) under long day-length conditions through the modification of chromatin structure by H3K4me3 demethylation in the promoter region of RFT1.
24743656	Identification of candidate genes associated with positive and negative heterosis in rice.	2014	PLoS One	To identify the genes responsible for yield related traits, and heterosis, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) libraries were constructed from leaves, roots and meristem tissues from the two parents, 'Nipponbare' and '93-11', and their F1 hybrid. From the MPSS libraries, 1-3 million signatures were obtained. Using cluster analysis, commonly and specifically expressed genes in the parents and their F1 hybrid were identified. To understand heterosis in the F1 hybrid, the differentially expressed genes in the F1 hybrid were mapped to yield related quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions using a linkage map constructed from 131 polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers with 266 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Nipponbare and 93-11. QTLs were identified for yield related traits including days to heading, plant height, plant type, number of tillers, main panicle length, number of primary branches per main panicle, number of kernels per main panicle, total kernel weight per main panicle, 1000 grain weight and total grain yield per plant. Seventy one QTLs for these traits were mapped, of which 3 QTLs were novel. Many highly expressed chromatin-related genes in the F1 hybrid encoding histone demethylases, histone deacetylases, argonaute-like proteins and polycomb proteins were located in these yield QTL regions. A total of 336 highly expressed transcription factor (TF) genes belonging to 50 TF families were identified in the yield QTL intervals. These findings provide the starting genomic materials to elucidate the molecular basis of yield related traits and heterosis in rice.
24760072	Genome-wide analysis of the bZIP transcription factors in cucumber.	2014	PLoS One	bZIP proteins are one of the largest transcriptional regulators playing crucial roles in plant development, physiological processes, and biotic/abiotic stress responses. Despite the availability of recently published draft genome sequence of Cucumis sativus, no comprehensive investigation of these family members has been presented for cucumber. We have identified 64 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the cucumber genome. Based on structural features of their encoded proteins, CsbZIP genes could be classified into 6 groups. Cucumber bZIP genes were expanded mainly by segmental duplication rather than tandem duplication. Although segmental duplication rate of the CsbZIP genes was lower than that of Arabidopsis, rice and sorghum, it was observed as a common expansion mechanism. Some orthologous relationships and chromosomal rearrangements were observed according to comparative mapping analysis with other species. Genome-wide expression analysis of bZIP genes indicated that 64 CsbZIP genes were differentially expressed in at least one of the ten sampled tissues. A total of 4 CsbZIP genes displayed higher expression values in leaf, flowers and root tissues. The in silico micro-RNA (miRNA) and target transcript analyses identified that a total of 21 CsbZIP genes were targeted by 38 plant miRNAs. CsbZIP20 and CsbZIP22 are the most targeted by miR165 and miR166 family members, respectively. We also analyzed the expression of ten CsbZIP genes in the root and leaf tissues of drought-stressed cucumber using quantitative RT-PCR. All of the selected CsbZIP genes were measured as increased in root tissue at 24th h upon PEG treatment. Contrarily, the down-regulation was observed in leaf tissues of all analyzed CsbZIP genes. CsbZIP12 and CsbZIP44 genes showed gradual induction of expression in root tissues during time points. This genome-wide identification and expression profiling provides new opportunities for cloning and functional analyses, which may be used in further studies for improving stress tolerance in plants.
24759881	Gas film retention and underwater photosynthesis during field submergence of four contrasting rice genotypes.	2014	J Exp Bot	Floods can completely submerge some rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields. Leaves of rice have gas films that aid O2 and CO2 exchange under water. The present study explored the relationship between gas film persistence and underwater net photosynthesis (PN) as influenced by genotype and submergence duration. Four contrasting genotypes (FR13A, IR42, Swarna, and Swarna-Sub1) were submerged for 13 days in the field and leaf gas films, chlorophyll, and the capacity for underwater PN at near ambient and high CO2 were assessed with time of submergence. At high CO2 during the PN assay, all genotypes initially showed high rates of underwater PN, and this rate was not affected by time of submergence in FR13A. This superior photosynthetic performance of FR13A was not evident in Swarna-Sub1 (carrying the SUB1 QTL) and the declines in underwater PN in both Swarna-Sub1 and Swarna were equal to that in IR42. At near ambient CO2 concentration, underwater PN declined in all four genotypes and this corresponded with loss of leaf gas films with time of submergence. FR13A retained leaf gas films moderately longer than the other genotypes, but gas film retention was not linked to SUB1. Diverse rice germplasm should be screened for gas film persistence during submergence, as this trait could potentially increase carbohydrate status and internal aeration owing to increased underwater PN, which contributes to submergence tolerance in rice.
24840818	Association studies of dormancy and cooking quality traits in direct-seeded indica rice.	2014	J Genet	Association analysis was applied to a panel of accessions of Assam rice (indica) using 98 SSR markers for dormancy-related traits and cooking quality. Analysis of population structure revealed 10 subgroups in the population. The mean r(2) and D' value for all intrachromosomal loci pairs was 0.24 and 0.51, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium between linked markers decreased with distance. Marker-trait associations were investigated using the unified mixed-model approach, considering both population structure (Q) and kinship (K). Genome-wide scanning, detected a total of seven significant marker-trait associations (P < 0.01), with the R(2) values ranging from 12.0 to 18.0%. The significant marker associations were for grain dormancy (RM27 on chromosome 2), α-amylase activity (RM27 and RM234 on chromosomes 2 and 7, respectively), germination (RM27 and RM106 on chromosome 2), amylose (RM282 on chromosome 3) and grain length elongation ratio (RM142 on chromosome 4). The present study revealed the association of marker RM27 with traits like dormancy, α-amylase activity and germination. Simple correlation analysis of these traits revealed that these traits were positively correlated with each other and this marker may be useful for simultaneous improvement of these traits. The study indicates the presence of novel QTLs for a few traits under consideration. The study reveals association of traits like dormancy, α-amylase activity, germination, amylose content, grain length elongation ratio with SSR markers indicating the feasibility of undertaking association analysis in conjunction with germplasm characterization.
24840849	Genetic controls on starch amylose content in wheat and rice grains.	2014	J Genet	Starch accumulates in plants as granules in chloroplasts of source organs such as leaves (transitory starch) or in amyloplasts of sink organs such as seeds, tubers and roots (storage starch). Starch is composed of two types of glucose polymers: the essentially linear polymer amylose and highly branched amylopectin. The amylose content of wheat and rice seeds is an important quality trait, affecting the nutritional and sensory quality of two of the world's most important crops. In this review, we focus on the relationship between amylose biosynthesis and the structure, physical behaviour and functionality of wheat and rice grains. We briefly describe the structure and composition of starch and then in more detail describe what is known about the mechanism of amylose synthesis and how the amount of amylose in starch might be controlled. This more specifically includes analysis of GBSS alleles, the relationship between waxy allelic forms and amylose, and related quantitative trait loci. Finally, different methods for increasing or lowering amylose content are evaluated.
24747952	The rice endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit is essential for optimal catalysis and allosteric regulation of the heterotetrameric enzyme.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Although an alternative pathway has been suggested, the prevailing view is that starch synthesis in cereal endosperm is controlled by the activity of the cytosolic isoform of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase). In rice, the cytosolic AGPase isoform is encoded by the OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 genes, which code for the small (S2b) and large (L2) subunits of the heterotetrameric enzyme, respectively. In this study, we isolated several allelic missense and nonsense OsAGPL2 mutants by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment of fertilized egg cells and by TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes). Interestingly, seeds from three of the missense mutants (two containing T139I and A171V) were severely shriveled and had seed weight and starch content comparable with the shriveled seeds from OsAGPL2 null mutants. Results from kinetic analysis of the purified recombinant enzymes revealed that the catalytic and allosteric regulatory properties of these mutant enzymes were significantly impaired. The missense heterotetramer enzymes and the S2b homotetramer had lower specific (catalytic) activities and affinities for the activator 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). The missense heterotetramer enzymes showed more sensitivity to inhibition by the inhibitor inorganic phosphate (Pi) than the wild-type AGPase, while the S2b homotetramer was profoundly tolerant to Pi inhibition. Thus, our results provide definitive evidence that starch biosynthesis during rice endosperm development is controlled predominantly by the catalytic activity of the cytoplasmic AGPase and its allosteric regulation by the effectors. Moreover, our results show that the L2 subunit is essential for both catalysis and allosteric regulatory properties of the heterotetramer enzyme.
24729002	Are rice (Oryza sativa L.) phosphate transporters regulated similarly by phosphate and arsenate? A comprehensive study.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Rice is one of the most important staple foods worldwide, but it often contains inorganic arsenic, which is toxic and gives rise to severe health problems. Rice plants take up arsenate As(V) via the phosphate transport pathways, though it is not known how As(V), as compared to phosphate, modifies the expression of phosphate transporters (PTs). Therefore, the impact of As(V) or phosphate (Pi) on the gene expression of PTs and several Pi signaling regulators was investigated. Rice plants were grown on medium containing different As(V) or Pi concentrations. Growth was evaluated and the expression of tested genes was quantified at different time points, using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The As and P content in plants was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As(V) elicited diverse and opposite responses of different PTs in roots and shoots, while Pi triggered a more shallow and uniform transcriptional response in several tested genes. Only a restricted set of genes, including PT2, PT3, PT5 and PT13 and two SPX-MFS family members, was particularly responsive to As(V). Despite some common reactions, the responses of the analyzed genes were predominantly ion-specific. The possible reasons and consequences are discussed.
24833511	Sequence-Based Analysis of Structural Organization and Composition of the Cultivated Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) Genome.	2014	Biology (Basel)	Sunflower is an important oilseed crop, as well as a model system for evolutionary studies, but its 3.6 gigabase genome has proven difficult to assemble, in part because of the high repeat content of its genome. Here we report on the sequencing, assembly, and analyses of 96 randomly chosen BACs from sunflower to provide additional information on the repeat content of the sunflower genome, assess how repetitive elements in the sunflower genome are organized relative to genes, and compare the genomic distribution of these repeats to that found in other food crops and model species. We also examine the expression of transposable element-related transcripts in EST databases for sunflower to determine the representation of repeats in the transcriptome and to measure their transcriptional activity. Our data confirm previous reports in suggesting that the sunflower genome is >78% repetitive. Sunflower repeats share very little similarity to other plant repeats such as those of Arabidopsis, rice, maize and wheat; overall 28% of repeats are "novel" to sunflower. The repetitive sequences appear to be randomly distributed within the sequenced BACs. Assuming the 96 BACs are representative of the genome as a whole, then approximately 5.2% of the sunflower genome comprises non TE-related genic sequence, with an average gene density of 18kbp/gene. Expression levels of these transposable elements indicate tissue specificity and differential expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues, suggesting that expressed TEs might contribute to sunflower development. The assembled BACs will also be useful for assessing the quality of several different draft assemblies of the sunflower genome and for annotating the reference sequence.
24760819	Cytochrome P450 CYP81A12 and CYP81A21 Are Associated with Resistance to Two Acetolactate Synthase Inhibitors in Echinochloa phyllopogon.	2014	Plant Physiol	Previous studies have demonstrated multiple herbicide resistance in California populations of Echinochloa phyllopogon, a noxious weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields. It was suggested that the resistance to two classes of acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) and penoxsulam (PX), may be caused by enhanced activities of herbicide-metabolizing cytochrome P450. We investigated BSM metabolism in the resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines of E. phyllopogon, which were originally collected from different areas in California. R plants metabolized BSM through O-demethylation more rapidly than S plants. Based on available information about BSM tolerance in rice, we isolated and analyzed P450 genes of the CYP81A subfamily in E. phyllopogon. Two genes, CYP81A12 and CYP81A21, were more actively transcribed in R plants compared with S plants. Transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) expressing either of the two genes survived in media containing BSM or PX at levels at which the wild type stopped growing. Segregation of resistances in the F2 generation from crosses of R and S plants suggested that the resistance to BSM and PX were each under the control of a single regulatory element. In F6 recombinant inbred lines, BSM and PX resistances cosegregated with increased transcript levels of CYP81A12 and CYP81A21. Heterologously produced CYP81A12 and CYP81A21 proteins in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) metabolized BSM through O-demethylation. Our results suggest that overexpression of the two P450 genes confers resistance to two classes of acetolactate synthase inhibitors to E. phyllopogon. The overexpression of the two genes could be regulated simultaneously by a single trans-acting element in the R line of E. phyllopogon.
24690462	Tos17 rice element: incomplete but effective.	2014	Mob DNA	BACKGROUND: Tos17 was the first LTR retrotransposon (Copia) described as active in cultivated rice, and is present in two copies in the genome of the sequenced Nipponbare variety. Only the chromosome 7 copy is active and able to retrotranspose, at least during in vitro culture, and this ability was widely used in insertional mutagenesis assays.

RESULTS: Here the structure of the active Tos17 was thoroughly annotated using a set of bioinformatic analyses.

CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, Tos17 appears to be a non-autonomous LTR retrotransposon, lacking the gag sequence and thus unable to transpose by itself.
24750781	WUSCHEL-related Homeobox genes in Populus tomentosa: diversified expression patterns and a functional similarity in adventitious root formation.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: WUSCHEL (WUS)-related homeobox (WOX) protein family members play important roles in the maintenance and proliferation of the stem cell niche in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), root apical meristem (RAM), and cambium (CAM). Although the roles of some WOXs in meristematic cell regulation have been well studied in annual plants such as Arabidopsis and rice, the expression and function of WOX members in woody plant poplars has not been systematically investigated. Here, we present the identification and comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of WOXs in Populus tomentosa.

RESULTS: A genome-wide survey identified 18 WOX encoding sequences in the sequenced genome of Populus trichocarpa (PtrWOXs). Phylogenetic and gene structure analysis revealed that these 18 PtrWOXs fall into modern/WUS, intermediate, and ancient clades, but that the WOX genes in P. trichocarpa may have expanded differently from the WOX genes in Arabidopsis. In the P. trichocarpa genome, no WOX members could be closely classified as AtWOX3, AtWOX6, AtWOX7, AtWOX10, and AtWOX14, but there were two copies of WOX genes that could be classified as PtrWUS, PtrWOX2, PtrWOX4, PtrWOX5, PtrWOX8/9, and PtrWOX11/12, and three copies of WOX genes that could be classified as PtrWOX1 and PtrWOX13. The use of primers specific for each PtrWOX gene allowed the identification and cloning of 18 WOX genes from P. tomentosa (PtoWOXs), a poplar species physiologically close to P. trichocarpa. It was found that PtoWOXs and PtrWOXs shared very high amino acid sequence identity, and that PtoWOXs could be classified identically to PtrWOXs. We revealed that the expression patterns of some PtoWOXs were different to their Arabidopsis counterparts. When PtoWOX5a and PtoWOX11/12a, as well as PtoWUSa and PtoWOX4a were ectopically expressed in transgenic hybrid poplars, the regeneration of adventitious root (AR) was promoted, indicating a functional similarity of these four WOXs in AR regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt towards a systematical analysis of the function of WOXs in P. tomentosa. A diversified expression, yet functional similarity of PtoWOXs in AR regeneration is revealed. Our findings provide useful information for further elucidation of the functions and mechanisms of WOXs in the development of poplars.
25007618	[Rice blast prediction model based on analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum].	2014	Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi	In order to detect rice blast more rapidly, accurately and nondestructively, the identification and early warning models of rice blast were established in the present research. First of all, rice blast was divided into three grades according to the relative area of disease spots in rice leaf and laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra of rice leaves at different disease levels were measured in the paddy fields. Meanwhile, 502-830 nm bands of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra were selected for the study of rice blast. Savitzky-Golay(SG) smoothing and First Derivative Transform(FDT) were applied for the pretreatment of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra. Then the method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to achieve the dimension reduction on spectral information, three principal components whose variance are greater than 1 and cumulative credibility is 99.924% were extracted by this method. Furthermore, the tentative data were divided into calibration set and validation set, the levels of rice blast were taken as the predictors. Combined with the calibration set which contains the disease and spectral information of 133 leaves, Discriminant Analysis (DA), Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were used respectively to establish the identification and early warning models of rice blast. The Prediction examinations of the three models were made based on the validation set which contains the disease and spectral information of 89 leaves. The results show that all the models of PCA-DA, PCA-MLRA and PCA-MLP can carry on the prediction of rice blast, and the average prediction accuracy of PCA-MLP prediction model is 91.7% which is improved compared with PCA- DA and PCA- MLRA.
24790111	A GAMYB homologue CsGAMYB1 regulates sex expression of cucumber via an ethylene-independent pathway.	2014	J Exp Bot	Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a typical monoecious vegetable with individual male and female flowers, and has been used as a model plant for sex determination. It is well known that sex differentiation of cucumber can be regulated by phytohormones, such as gibberellic acid (GA) and ethylene. The molecular mechanism of female sex expression modulated by ethylene has been widely understood, but how GA controls male sex expression remains elusive. In hermaphroditic Arabidopsis and rice, GA can regulate stamen and anther development via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB. Here we characterized a GAMYB homologue CsGAMYB1 in cucumber. We found that CsGAMYB1 is predominantly expressed in male flower buds, where its expression is upregulated by GA3 treatment. CsGAMYB1 protein is localized in the nucleus. CsGAMYB1 can partially rescue stamen development and fertility phenotypes of an Arabidopsis myb33 myb65 double mutant. However, constitutive overexpression of CsGAMYB1 in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in male sterility, which mimics the effect of GA overdose in flower development. Knockdown of CsGAMYB1 in cucumber decreases the ratio of nodes with male and female flowers, and ethylene is not involved in this process. Our data suggest that CsGAMYB1 regulates sex expression of cucumber via an ethylene-independent pathway.
24742282	RNA sequencing-mediated transcriptome analysis of rice plants in endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is widely known to function in eukaryotes to maintain the homeostasis of the ER when unfolded or misfolded proteins are overloaded in the ER. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the ER stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we previously analyzed the expression profile of stably transformed rice in which an ER stress sensor/transducer OsIRE1 was knocked-down, using the combination of preliminary microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. In this study, to obtain more detailed expression profiles of genes involved in the initial stages of the ER stress response in rice, we performed RNA sequencing of wild-type and transgenic rice plants produced by homologous recombination in which endogenous genomic OsIRE1 was replaced by missense alleles defective in ribonuclease activity.

RESULTS: At least 38,076 transcripts were investigated by RNA sequencing, 380 of which responded to ER stress at a statistically significant level (195 were upregulated and 185 were downregulated). Furthermore, we successfully identified 17 genes from the set of 380 ER stress-responsive genes that were not included in the probe set of the currently available microarray chip in rice. Notably, three of these 17 genes were non-annotated genes, even in the latest version of the Rice Annotation Project Data Base (RAP-DB, version IRGSP-1.0).

CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, RNA sequencing-mediated expression profiling provided valuable information about the ER stress response in rice plants and led to the discovery of new genes related to ER stress.
24920970	Quantitative trait locus analysis of resistance to panicle blast in the rice cultivar Miyazakimochi.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice blast is a destructive disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, and it has a large impact on rice production worldwide. Compared with leaf blast resistance, our understanding of panicle blast resistance is limited, with only one panicle blast resistance gene, Pb1, isolated so far. The japonica cultivar Miyazakimochi shows resistance to panicle blast, yet the genetic components accounting for this resistance remain to be determined.

RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated the panicle blast resistance of populations derived from a cross between Miyazakimochi and the Bikei 22 cultivar, which is susceptible to both leaf and panicle blast. The phenotypic analyses revealed no correlation between panicle blast resistance and leaf blast resistance. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of 158 recombinant inbred lines using 112 developed genome-wide and 35 previously reported polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers revealed the presence of two QTLs conferring panicle blast resistance in Miyazakimochi: a major QTL, qPbm11, on chromosome 11; and a minor QTL, qPbm9, on chromosome 9. To clarify the contribution of these QTLs to panicle blast resistance, 24 lines homozygous for each QTL were selected from 2,818 progeny of a BC2F7 backcrossed population, and characterized for disease phenotypes. The panicle blast resistance of the lines harboring qPbm11 was very similar to the resistant donor parental cultivar Miyazakimochi, whereas the contribution of qPbm9 to the resistance was small. Genotyping of the BC2F7 individuals highlighted the overlap between the qPbm11 region and a locus of the panicle blast resistance gene, Pb1. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed that the Pb1 transcript was absent in the panicles of Miyazakimochi, demonstrating that qPbm11 is a novel genetic component of panicle blast resistance.

CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that Miyazakimochi harbors a novel panicle blast resistance controlled mainly by the major QTL qPbm11. qPbm11 is distinct from Pb1 and could be a genetic source for breeding panicle blast resistance, and will improve understanding of the molecular basis of host resistance to panicle blast.
24734873	Identification and characterization of microRNAs in the flag leaf and developing seed of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological processes in plants. Considerable data are available on miRNAs involved in the development of rice, maize and barley. In contrast, little is known about miRNAs and their functions in the development of wheat. In this study, five small RNA (sRNA) libraries from wheat seedlings, flag leaves, and developing seeds were developed and sequenced to identify miRNAs and understand their functions in wheat development.

RESULTS: Twenty-four known miRNAs belonging to 15 miRNA families were identified from 18 MIRNA loci in wheat in the present study, including 15 miRNAs (9 MIRNA loci) first identified in wheat, 13 miRNA families (16 MIRNA loci) being highly conserved and 2 (2 MIRNA loci) moderately conserved. In addition, fifty-five novel miRNAs were also identified. The potential target genes for 15 known miRNAs and 37 novel miRNAs were predicted using strict criteria, and these target genes are involved in a wide range of biological functions. Four of the 15 known miRNA families and 22 of the 55 novel miRNAs were preferentially expressed in the developing seeds with logarithm (log2) of the fold change of 1.0 ~ 7.6, and half of them were seed-specific, suggesting that they participate in regulating wheat seed development and metabolism. From 5 days post-anthesis to 20 days post-anthesis, miR164 and miR160 increased in abundance in the developing seeds, whereas miR169 decreased, suggesting their coordinating functions in the different developmental stages of wheat seed. Moreover, 8 known miRNA families and 28 novel miRNAs exhibited tissue-biased expression in wheat flag leaves, with the logarithm of the fold changes of 0.1 ~ 5.2. The putative targets of these tissue-preferential miRNAs were involved in various metabolism and biological processes, suggesting complexity of the regulatory networks in different tissues. Our data also suggested that wheat flag leaves have more complicated regulatory networks of miRNAs than developing seeds.

CONCLUSIONS: Our work identified and characterised wheat miRNAs, their targets and expression patterns. This study is the first to elucidate the regulatory networks of miRNAs involved in wheat flag leaves and developing seeds, and provided a foundation for future studies on specific functions of these miRNAs.
24787501	Bcl-2 suppresses activation of VPEs by inhibiting cytosolic Ca²⁺ level with elevated K⁺ efflux in NaCl-induced PCD in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Bcl-2 is one of the most important antiapoptotic members in mammals and prevents many forms of apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Our previous study revealed that overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly suppressed H2O2/NaCl-induced programmed cell death via inhibiting the transcriptional activation of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3 in transgenic rice. However, Ca(2+) and K(+) homeostasis of this process remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate whether nonselective cation channels (NSCC) blockers affect Bcl-2 function in rice under salt stress and how Bcl-2 affects ion homeostasis in salt stress-induced PCD. The results showed that overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly decreased transient elevations in the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, inhibited NaCl-induced K(+) efflux but not H(+) efflux across the plasma membrane, and further suppressed the expression levels of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, leading to the inhibition of salt-induced PCD and increase of tolerance to salt stress in transgenic rice. During the NaCl-induced PCD, the effects of a NSCC blocker La(3+) on ion homeostasis and VPEs expression in wild-type were similar to the effects of Bcl-2 overexpression in transgenic line. However, a synergistic effect of Bcl-2 and La(3+) was not obviously detectable. Our results suggested that Bcl-2 played an important role in suppression of NaCl-induced PCD by disruption of ion homeostasis, providing an insight into the mechanistic study of plant VPEs, cytosolic Ca(2+) level and K(+) efflux.
24780396	Rice BiP3 regulates immunity mediated by the PRRs XA3 and XA21 but not immunity mediated by the NB-LRR protein, Pi5.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Plant innate immunity is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular NB-LRR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) proteins. Overexpression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, luminal-binding protein 3 (BiP3) compromises resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) mediated by the rice PRR XA21 [12]. Here we show that BiP3 overexpression also compromises resistance mediated by rice XA3, a PRR that provides broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo. In contrast, BiP3 overexpression has no effect on resistance mediated by rice Pi5, an NB-LRR protein that confers resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Our results suggest that rice BiP3 regulates membrane-resident PRR-mediated immunity.
25036957	Nocturnal phosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in the leaves of hygrophytic C3 monocots.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) undergoes activity regulation through reversible phosphorylation. The day/night phosphorylation of leaf PEPC in 27 C3 plant species was analyzed by immunoblotting. PEPC was phosphorylated in the daytime in 12 species, whereas it was phosphorylated at night in three species, rice, Monochoria vaginalis, and Sagittaria trifolia, all of which are hygrophytic monocots. Immunoblot analysis of isolated chloroplasts of M. vaginalis identified a PEPC protein inside the chloroplast in addition to cytosolic isozyme(s) as previously shown in genus Oryza. Using transgenic rice overexpressing the maize PEPC in the cytosol, we confirmed that the cytosolic PEPC underwent the nocturnal phosphorylation. These results suggest the interrelationship between the presence of chloroplastic PEPC and the nocturnal phosphorylation of cytosolic isozyme(s).
24755044	The phenotypic predisposition of the parent in F1 hybrid is correlated with transcriptome preference of the positive general combining ability parent.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Sprague and Tatum (1942) introduced the concepts of general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) to evaluate the breeding parents and F1 hybrid performance, respectively. Since then, the GCA was widely used in cross breeding for elite parent selection. However, the molecular basis of GCA remains to unknown.

RESULTS: We studied the transcriptomes of three varieties and three F1 hybrids using RNA-Sequencing. Transcriptome sequence analysis revealed that the transcriptome profiles of the F1s were similar to the positive GCA-effect parent. Moreover, the expression levels of most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were equal to the parent with a positive GCA effect. Analysis of the gene expression patterns of gibberellic acid (GA) and flowering time pathways that determine plant height and flowering time in rice validated the preferential transcriptome expression of the parents with positive GCA effect. Furthermore, H3K36me3 modification bias in the Pseudo-Response Regulators (PRR) gene family was observed in the positive GCA effect parents and demonstrated that the phenotype and transcriptome bias in the positive GCA effect parents have been epigenetically regulated by either global modification or specific signaling pathways in rice.

CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the transcriptome profiles and DEGs in the F1s were highly related to phenotype bias to the positive GCA-effect parent. The transcriptome bias toward high GCA parents in F1 hybrids attributed to H3K36me3 modification both on global modification level and specific signaling pathways. Our results indicated the transcriptome profile and epigenetic modification level bias to high GCA parents could be the molecular basis of GCA.
24908511	Rice RCN1/OsABCG5 mutation alters accumulation of essential and nonessential minerals and causes a high Na/K ratio, resulting in a salt-sensitive phenotype.	2014	Plant Sci	Mineral balance and salt stress are major factors affecting plant growth and yield. Here, we characterized the effects of rice (Oryza sativa L.) reduced culm number1 (rcn1), encoding a G subfamily ABC transporter (OsABCG5) involved in accumulation of essential and nonessential minerals, the Na/K ratio, and salt tolerance. Reduced potassium and elevated sodium in field-grown plants were evident in rcn1 compared to original line 'Shiokari' and four independent rcn mutants, rcn2, rcn4, rcn5 and rcn6. A high Na/K ratio was evident in the shoots and roots of rcn1 under K starvation and salt stress in hydroponically cultured plants. Downregulation of SKC1/OsHKT1;5 in rcn1 shoots under salt stress demonstrated that normal function of RCN1/OsABCG5 is essential for upregulation of SKC1/OsHKT1;5 under salt stress. The accumulation of various minerals in shoots and roots was also altered in the rcn1 mutant compared to 'Shiokari' under control conditions, potassium starvation, and salt and d-sorbitol treatments. The rcn1 mutation resulted in a salt-sensitive phenotype. We concluded that RCN1/OsABCG5 is a salt tolerance factor that acts via Na/K homeostasis, at least partly by regulation of SKC1/OsHKT1;5 in shoots.
24757324	PGPR regulate caspase-like activity, programmed cell death, and antioxidant enzyme activity in paddy under salinity.	2014	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	The response of two root associated bacteria Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and Bacillus pumilus were studied in the (salt-sensitive) rice GJ17 cultivar to salinity under controlled environmental growth conditions for protection of plant from adverse effect of salinity. Salinity affects the growth of salt-sensitive cultivar, but inoculation of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) reduces the harmful effect of salinity. The present study states that PGPR helps to reduce lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase activity in salt-sensitive GJ17 cultivar under salinity and play an important role in the growth regulation for positive adaptation of plants to salt stress. This study shows that inoculation of paddy (Oryza sativa) with such bacteria could provide salt-tolerant ability by reducing the toxicity of reactive oxygen species by reducing plant cell membrane index, cell caspase-like protease activity, and programmed cell death and hence resulted in increase cell viability. As these isolates remain associated with the roots, the effects of tolerance against salinity are observed here. Results also indicate that isolated PGPR strain help in alleviating up to 1.5 % salinity stress as well as improve tolerance.
24946604	[Effects of microcystins on growth and antioxidant system of rice roots].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The effect of different concentrations (1, 100, 1000 and 3 000 microg x L(-1)) of microcystins (MCs) on growth, absorb activity, antioxidant system and its accumulation in roots of rice seedlings were studied. The results show that MCs accumulation was positively correlated with MCs concentration. After the treatment with 1 microg x L(-1) MCs, the root growth and activity increased. Meanwhile, catalase (CAT) activity was increased to maintain H2O2 at normal levels. After the treatment with 100 microg x L(-1) MCs, the root growth and activity were inhibited whereas CAT had no obvious change. High concentrations (1000 microg x L(-1) and 3000 microg x L(-1)) of MCs not only inhibited root growth and activity, but decreased CAT activity, leading to excessive H2O2 accumulation and membrane peroxidation. After a 7-day recovery, MCs accumulations in roots in all treatment groups were all lower than those measured during the stress period. For the 100 microg x L(-1) MCs treated group, the inhibition on root growth and root activity, and membrane peroxidation were alleviated, better than those measured during the stress period. However, for 1000 microg x L(-1) and 3000 microg x L(-1) MCs treated groups, inhibition on root growth, root activity, and CAT activity were heavier than those during the stress period, and oxidation stress intensified further, indicating that the damage caused by high concentrations (1 000 microg x L(-1) and 3000 microg x L(-1)) of MCs on rice roots was irreversible.
24715026	High-resolution genetic mapping of rice bacterial blight resistance gene Xa23.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the most devastating bacterial disease of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple food crop that feeds half of the world's population. In management of this disease, the most economical and effective approach is cultivating resistant varieties. Due to rapid change of pathogenicity in the pathogen, it is necessary to identify and characterize more host resistance genes for breeding new resistant varieties. We have previously identified the BB resistance (R) gene Xa23 that confers the broadest resistance to Xoo strains isolated from different rice-growing regions and preliminarily mapped the gene within a 1.7 cm region on the long arm of rice chromosome 11. Here, we report fine genetic mapping and in silico analysis of putative candidate genes of Xa23. Based on F2 mapping populations derived from crosses between Xa23-containing rice line CBB23 and susceptible varieties JG30 or IR24, six new STS markers Lj36, Lj46, Lj138, Lj74, A83B4, and Lj13 were developed. Linkage analysis revealed that the new markers were co-segregated with or closely linked to the Xa23 locus. Consequently, the Xa23 gene was mapped within a 0.4 cm region between markers Lj138 and A83B4, in which the co-segregating marker Lj74 was identified. The corresponding physical distance between Lj138 and A83B4 on Nipponbare genome is 49.8 kb. Six Xa23 candidate genes have been annotated, including four candidate genes encoding hypothetical proteins and the other two encoding a putative ADP-ribosylation factor protein and a putative PPR protein. These results will facilitate marker-assisted selection of Xa23 in rice breeding and molecular cloning of this valuable R gene.
25202619	Development of novel, exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers from EST databases and evaluation of their phylogenetic utility in Commiphora (Burseraceae).	2014	Appl Plant Sci	UNLABELLED: OrderedDict([('@Label', 'UNLABELLED')])

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Novel nuclear exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers were developed to increase phylogenetic resolution among recently diverged lineages in the frankincense and myrrh family, Burseraceae, using Citrus, Arabidopsis, and Oryza genome resources. •

METHODS AND RESULTS: Primer pairs for 48 nuclear introns were developed using the genome resource IntrEST and were screened using species of Commiphora and other Burseraceae taxa. Four putative intron regions (RPT6A, BXL2, mtATP Synthase D, and Rab6) sequenced successfully for multiple taxa and recovered phylogenies consistent with those of existing studies. In some cases, these regions yielded informative sequence variation on par with that of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer. •

CONCLUSIONS: The combination of freely available genome resources and our design criteria have uncovered four single-copy nuclear intron regions that are useful for phylogenetic reconstruction of Burseraceae taxa. Because our EPIC primers also amplify Arabidopsis, we recommend their trial in other rosid and eudicot lineages.
24977183	CMYB1 encoding a MYB transcriptional activator is involved in abiotic stress and circadian rhythm in rice.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	Through analysis of cold-induced transcriptome, a novel gene encoding a putative MYB transcription factor was isolated and designated Cold induced MYB 1 (CMYB1). Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that CMYB1 was highly expressed in rice stems and nodes. qRT-PCR assay indicated that CMYB1 was dramatically induced by cold stress (>100-folds) and induced by exogenous ABA and osmotic stress. Interestingly, CMYB1 showed rhythmic expression profile in rice leaves at different developmental stages. Subcellular localization assay suggested that CMYB1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein was localized in the nuclei. Moreover, CMYB1 exhibited the transcriptional activation activity when transiently expressed in rice protoplast cells. Taken together, CMYB1 probably functions as a transcriptional activator in mediating stress and rhythm responsive gene expression in rice.

24814750	Water-stress-induced inhibition of α-tubulin gene expression during growth, and its implications for reproductive success in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	A drought-suppressed cDNA (RiP-3), encoding a putative α-tubulin protein was isolated from rice panicle at pollen-mother-cell meiosis stage. Analysis of its deduced amino acid sequence showed all the typical structural motifs for plant α-tubulins. The expression of α-tubulin transcripts was observed in all the reproductive organs of rice panicle, and in 5- or 15-day old seedlings, but not in mature leaves. Expression levels were positively correlated with the regions and periods of high growth, and the transcript level declined in parallel with drought-induced reduction in growth rates in all tissues examined. Immunoblot analysis of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody showed that the level of protein paralleled the changes in the transcript abundance in these organs. In situ immunolocalization of the α-tubulin protein in sections of the basal part of 5-day old seedlings showed that the highest levels of the protein were associated with the fastest growing leaf whorls, and the protein level declined upon a brief episode of water stress. Given the known critical role of tubulin in cell division and elongation, the results indicate that the expression of α-tubulin gene may be part of the events that suppress panicle elongation during water deficit, which is in turn a suspected cause of male reproductive failure and yield reduction in rice.
24755305	Production of cecropin A antimicrobial peptide in rice seed endosperm.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cecropin A is a natural antimicrobial peptide that exhibits rapid, potent and long-lasting lytic activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, thus having great biotechnological potential. Here, we report a system for producing bioactive cecropin A in rice seeds.

RESULTS: Transgenic rice plants expressing a codon-optimized synthetic cecropin A gene drived by an endosperm-specific promoter, either the glutelin B1 or glutelin B4 promoter, were generated. The signal peptide sequence from either the glutelin B1 or the glutelin B4 were N-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the cecropin A. We also studied whether the presence of the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal at the C-terminal has an effect on cecropin A subcellular localization and accumulation. The transgenic rice plants showed stable transgene integration and inheritance. We show that cecropin A accumulates in protein storage bodies in the rice endosperm, particularly in type II protein bodies, supporting that the glutelin N-terminal signal peptides play a crucial role in directing the cecropin A to this organelle, independently of being tagged with the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. The production of cecropin A in transgenic rice seeds did not affect seed viability or seedling growth. Furthermore, transgenic cecropin A seeds exhibited resistance to infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens (Fusarium verticillioides and Dickeya dadantii, respectively) indicating that the in planta-produced cecropin A is biologically active.

CONCLUSIONS: Rice seeds can sustain bioactive cecropin A production and accumulation in protein bodies. The system might benefit the production of this antimicrobial agent for subsequent applications in crop protection and food preservation.
24691571	Tocopherol-deficient rice plants display increased sensitivity to photooxidative stress.	2014	Planta	Tocopherols are lipophilic antioxidants that are synthesized exclusively in photosynthetic organisms. Despite extensive in vivo characterization of tocopherol functions in plants, their functions in the monocot model plant, rice, remain to be determined. In this study, transgenic rice plants constitutively silenced for homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT) and tocopherol cyclase (TC) activity were generated. Silencing of HPT and TC resulted in up to a 98 % reduction in foliar tocopherol content relative to the control plants, which was also confirmed by transcript level analysis. When grown under normal conditions, HPT and TC transgenics showed no distinctive phenotype relative to the control plants, except a slight reduction in plant height and a slight decrease in the first leaf length. However, when exposed to high light at low temperatures, HPT and TC transgenics had a significantly higher leaf yellowing index than the control plants. The tocopherol-deficient plants decreased their total individual chlorophyll levels, their chlorophyll a/b ratio, and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, whereas increased lipid peroxidation levels relative to the control plants. Tocopherol deficiency had no effect on ascorbate biosynthesis, but induced glutathione, antheraxanthin, and particularly zeaxanthin biosynthesis for compensation under stressful conditions. However, despite these compensation mechanisms, HPT and TC transgenics still exhibited altered phenotypes under high light at low temperatures. Therefore, it is suggested that tocopherols cannot be replaced and play an indispensable role in photoprotection in rice.
24763607	Genotypic variation in partitioning of dry matter and manganese between source and sink organs of rice under manganese stress.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Genetic variability in dry matter and manganese partitioning between source and sink organs was the key mechanism for Mn efficient rice genotypes to cope with Mn stress. Considerable differences exist among cereal genotypes to cope manganese (Mn) deficiency, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Minimal information regarding partitioning and/or remobilization of dry matter and Mn between source and sink organs exists in rice genotypes differing in Mn efficiency. The present study was aimed to assess the growth dynamics in terms of dry matter and Mn remobilization in the whole plant (leaves and tillers as source and panicles and grains as sink) during the grain development in diverse rice genotypes. The efficient genotypes accumulated higher dry matter than inefficient genotypes under low Mn level. The translocation index i.e., uptake in grain/total uptake was 0.11 in efficient genotype (PR 116) and 0.04 in inefficient genotypes (PR 111). The efficient genotype had higher grain Mn utilization efficiency of 0.71 in comparison to 0.48 of inefficient genotype indicating that in efficient genotype, Mn in grain produces more dry matter than inefficient genotypes. The efficient genotypes also had higher flag leaf area and nitrate reductase activity. The source of efficient genotypes contributed to a greater extent to developing sink but further mobilization to grain was hindered by panicle. The panicle of inefficient genotypes had higher per cent of Mn uptake than efficient genotypes indicating that Mn was least mobilized from panicle to grain in inefficient genotypes. The lower per cent uptake of Mn in efficient genotypes indicated that Mn was mobilized from panicle to developing grain and this led to higher Mn translocation index in grain of efficient genotypes. The uptake partitioning revealed that source of all genotypes mobilized the Mn towards the sink to almost same extent but it was the panicle where highest per cent uptake per plant was in inefficient genotypes and lowest in efficient genotypes. The lowest per cent uptake in panicle of efficient genotypes revealed that it supported developing grain to have highest translocation index.
25076839	Genetic factors responsible for eating and cooking qualities of rice grains in a recombinant inbred population of an inter-subspecific cross.	2014	Mol Breed	The eating and cooking qualities of rice grains are the major determinants of consumer preference and, consequently, the economic value of a specific rice variety. These two qualities are largely determined by the physicochemical properties of the starch, i.e. the starch composition, of the rice grain. In our study, we determined the genetic factors responsible for the physicochemical properties of starch in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of japonica cv. Tainung 78 × indica cv. Taichung Sen 17 (TCS 17) cultivated over two crop seasons by examining palatability characteristics and several Rapid Viscosity Analyzer (RVA) parameters. Thirty-four quantitative trait loci (QTLs), each explaining between 1.2 and 78.1 % phenotypic variation, were mapped in clusters on eight chromosomes in 190 RILs genotyped with 139 markers. Ten pairs of QTLs were detected in the two environments, of which seven were in agreement with previous findings, suggesting that these QTLs may express stable experimental populations across various environments. Waxy (Wx), which controls amylose synthesis, was determined to be a primary gene regulating the physicochemical properties of cooked rice grains, as indicated by the presence of a major QTL cluster on chromosome 6 and by marker regression analysis. Six starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) which were located in the QTL intervals significantly differed in terms of gene expression between the two parents during grain-filling and were important genetic factors affecting physicochemical properties. The expression of four genes, PUL, ISA2, GBSSI, and SSII-3, was significantly upregulated in TCS 17, and this expression was positively correlated with six traits. The effects of the six SSRGs and gene interaction depended on genetic background and environment; grain quality may be fine tuned by selecting for SBE4 for japonica and PUL for indica. We provide valuable information for application in the breeding of new rice varieties as daily staple food and for use in industrial manufacturing by marker-assisted selection.
24714629	Traffic jam on the cellular secretory pathway generated by a replication protein from a plant RNA virus.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Although positive-strand RNA [(+)RNA] viruses have a limited coding capacity, they can replicate efficiently in host cells because of their ability to use host-derived proteins, membranes, lipids, and metabolites, and to rewire cellular trafficking pathways. Previously, we showed that a plant RNA virus, the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), hijacked Arf1 and Sar1, which are small GTPases that regulate the biogenesis of COPI and COPII vesicles, respectively, for viral RNA replication. These small GTPases are relocated from appropriate subcellular compartments to the viral RNA replication sites by p27 replication protein, which raises the possibility that RCNMV interferes with the cellular secretory pathway. Here, we examined this possibility by using green fluorescent protein-fused rice SCAMP1 and Arabidopsis LRR84A as secretory pathway marker proteins and showed that p27 inhibited the trafficking of these proteins. RCNMV-mediated inhibition of the host secretion pathway and its possible impact on plant-virus interaction are discussed.
24794197	Substitution of Thr(55) by Gly and Lys(48) by Asp in OsTrx20 using site-directed mutagenesis.	2014	Int J Biol Macromol	Thioredoxins are small (12-13kDa) ubiquitous proteins containing a redox active disulfide bridge. The primary structure of one of the rice Trx isoforms, OsTrx20, in which Thr is substituted for the largely conserved Gly in position 55 in the active site and Lys is substituted for the conserved Asp/Asn in position 48 is considerably different with other h-type Trx isoforms. In order to probe the functional roles of Thr-55 and Lys-48 in OsTrx20, Thr was replaced with Gly and Lys with Asp using site-directed mutagenesis. The wild type OsTrx20 as well as single mutants T55GOsTrx20, K48DOsTrx20 and the double mutant T55G-K48DOstrx20 were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The changes in the ability to reduce insulin for OsTrx20 and mutants as well as OsTrx23 which has a Trx typical active site were monitored in the pH range 6.5-8. The results showed that whereas the activity of wild type OsTrx20 is dependent on pH and decreases remarkably at high pH values, the activities of mutants T55GOsTrx20, K48DOsTrx20, T55G-K48DOsTrx20 and wild type OsTrx23 slightly change under different pH conditions. These results support the significant involvement of residues Thr-55 and Lys-48 in instability of OsTrx20 activity under pH variations.
24752581	Toward the positional cloning of qBlsr5a, a QTL underlying resistance to bacterial leaf streak, using overlapping sub-CSSLs in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Bacterial leaf steak (BLS) is one of the most destructive diseases in rice. Studies have shown that BLS resistance in rice is quantitatively inherited, controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A QTL with relatively large effect, qBlsr5a, was previously mapped in a region of ∼ 380 kb on chromosome 5. To fine map qBlsr5a further, a set of overlapping sub-chromosome segment substitution lines (sub-CSSLs) were developed from a large secondary F2 population (containing more than 7000 plants), in which only the chromosomal region harboring qBlsr5a was segregated. By genotyping the sub-CSSLs with molecular markers covering the target region and phenotyping the sub-CSSLs with artificial inoculation, qBlsr5a was delimited to a 30.0-kb interval, in which only three genes were predicted. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the three putative genes did not show significant response to the infection of BLS pathogen in both resistant and susceptible parental lines. However, two nucleotide substitutions were found in the coding sequence of gene LOC_Os05g01710, which encodes the gamma chain of transcription initiation factor IIA (TFIIAγ). The nucleotide substitutions resulted in a change of the 39th amino acid from valine (in the susceptible parent) to glutamic acid (in the resistant parent). Interestingly, the resistant parent allele of LOC_Os05g01710 is identical to xa5, a major gene resistant to bacterial leaf blight (another bacterial disease of rice). These results suggest that LOC_Os05g01710 is very possibly the candidate gene of qBlsr5a.
24752795	Exogenous sodium nitroprusside and glutathione alleviate copper toxicity by reducing copper uptake and oxidative damage in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2014	Protoplasma	Nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) regulate a variety of physiological processes and stress responses; however, their involvement in mitigating Cu toxicity in plants has not been extensively studied. This study investigated the interactive effect of exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and GSH on Cu homeostasis and Cu-induced oxidative damage in rice seedlings. Hydroponically grown 12-day-old seedlings were subjected to 100 μM CuSO4 alone and in combination with 200 μM SNP (an NO donor) and 200 μM GSH. Cu exposure for 48 h resulted in toxicity symptoms such as stunted growth, chlorosis, and rolling in leaves. Cu toxicity was also manifested by a sharp increase in lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, lipid peroxidation (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), proline (Pro) content, and rapid reductions in biomass, chlorophyll (Chl), and relative water content (RWC). Cu-caused oxidative stress was evident by overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide (O2 (•-)) and H2O2). Ascorbate (AsA) content decreased while GSH and phytochelatin (PC) content increased significantly in Cu-stressed seedlings. Exogenous SNP, GSH, or SNP + GSH decreased toxicity symptoms and diminished a Cu-induced increase in LOX activity, O2 (•-), H2O2, MDA, and Pro content. They also counteracted a Cu-induced increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II activities, which paralleled changes in ROS and MDA levels. These seedlings also showed a significant increase in catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities, and AsA and PC content compared with the seedlings stressed with Cu alone. Cu analysis revealed that SNP and GSH restricted the accumulation of Cu in the roots and leaves of Cu-stressed seedlings. Our results suggest that Cu exposure provoked an oxidative burden while reduced Cu uptake and modulating the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems by adding SNP and GSH play an important role in alleviating Cu toxicity. Furthermore, the protective action of GSH and SNP + GSH was more efficient than SNP alone.
24771143	Functional analyses of a putative plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter gene isolated from salt tolerant Helianthus tuberosus.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Jerusalem artichokes (Helianthus tuberosus L.) can tolerate relatively higher salinity, drought and heat stress. In this paper, we report the cloning of a Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) gene encoding a plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from a highly salt-tolerant genotype of H. tuberosus, NY1, named HtSOS1 and characterization of its function in yeast and rice. The amino acid sequence of HtSOS1 showed 83.4% identity with the previously isolated SOS1 gene from the Chrysanthemum crassum. The mRNA level in the leaves of H. tuberosus was significantly up-regulated by presence of high concentrations of NaCl. Localization analysis using rice protoplast expression showed that the protein encoded by HtSOS1 was located in the plasma membrane. HtSOS1 partially suppressed the salt sensitive phenotypes of a salt sensitive yeast strain. In comparison with wild type (Oryza sativa L., ssp. Japonica. cv. Nipponbare), the transgenic rice expressed with HtSOS1 could exclude more Na(+) and accumulate more K(+). Expression of HtSOS1 decreased Na(+) content much larger in the shoot than in the roots, resulting in more water content in the transgenic rice than WT. These data suggested that HtSOS1 may be useful in transgenic approaches to improving the salinity tolerance of glycophyte.
24777609	The transcriptional network of WRKY53 in cereals links oxidative responses to biotic and abiotic stress inputs.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	The transcription factor WRKY53 is expressed during biotic and abiotic stress responses in cereals, but little is currently known about its regulation, structure and downstream targets. We sequenced the wheat ortholog TaWRKY53 and its promoter region, which revealed extensive similarity in gene architecture and cis-acting regulatory elements to the rice ortholog OsWRKY53, including the presence of stress-responsive abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABRE) motifs and GCC-boxes. Four proteins interacted with the WRKY53 promoter in yeast one-hybrid assays, suggesting that this gene can receive inputs from diverse stress-related pathways such as calcium signalling and senescence, and environmental cues such as drought and ultraviolet radiation. The Ser/Thr receptor kinase ORK10/LRK10 and the apoplastic peroxidase POC1 are two downstream targets for regulation by the WRKY53 transcription factor, predicted based on the presence of W-box motifs in their promoters and coregulation with WRKY53, and verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Both ORK10/LRK10 and POC1 are upregulated during cereal responses to pathogens and aphids and important components of the oxidative burst during the hypersensitive response. Taken with our yeast two-hybrid assay which identified a strong protein-protein interaction between microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3 and WRKY53, this implies that the WRKY53 transcriptional network regulates oxidative responses to a wide array of stresses.
24738738	Tissue-specific and light-dependent regulation of phytochrome gene expression in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Phytochromes are red- and far red light photoreceptors in higher plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has three phytochromes (phyA, phyB and phyC), which play distinct as well as cooperative roles in light perception. To gain a better understanding of individual phytochrome functions in rice, expression patterns of three phytochrome genes were characterized using promoter-GUS fusion constructs. The phytochrome genes PHYA and PHYB showed distinct patterns of tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression in rice. The PHYA promoter-GUS was expressed in all leaf tissues in etiolated seedlings, while its expression was restricted to vascular bundles in expanded leaves of light-grown seedlings. These observations suggest that light represses the expression of the PHYA gene in all cells except vascular bundle cells in rice seedlings. Red light was effective, but far red light was ineffective in gene repression, and red light-induced repression was not observed in phyB mutants. These results indicate that phyB is involved in light-dependent and tissue-specific repression of the PHYA gene in rice.
24811675	Arsenic stress in rice: redox consequences and regulation by iron.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Arsenic (As) contamination is a serious hazard to human health and agriculture. It has emerged as an important threat for rice cultivation mainly in South Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the effect of iron (Fe) supplementation on arsenic (As(V)) induced oxidative stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice seedlings treated with As(V) for 24 and 48 h in presence or absence of 2.5 mM Fe after which the root and shoot tissues were harvested for analysis. The results indicate significant (p ≤ 0.05) reduction in root and shoot length/dry biomass. Supplementation of Fe showed improved growth responses under stress as compared to As(V) alone. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of roots under As(V) treatment for 48 h showed major alterations in root structure and integrity, although no noticeable changes were observed in Fe - supplemented seedlings. Significantly high (p ≤ 0.05) accumulation of As(V) was observed in root and shoot after 24 and 48 h of stress. However, under Fe - supplementation As accumulation in root and shoot were considerably low after 24 and 48 h of As(V) treatment. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in both root and shoot increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) after 24 and 48 h of As(V) treatment. In Fe - supplemented seedlings, the levels of H2O2 and MDA were considerably low as compared to As(V) alone. Ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) levels also increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) under As(V) stress as compared to control and Fe-supplemented seedlings. Activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) high after 24 and 48 h of As(V) treatment as compared to Fe-supplemented seedlings. The gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of metallothionein (MT1, MT2) and nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP2;1) genes after 5d of As treatment, while their expressions were repressed under Fe-supplementation. Our results indicate that Fe regulates oxidative stress and promotes growth under As stress.
24908500	In vitro studies of enzymatic properties of starch synthases and interactions between starch synthase I and starch branching enzymes from rice.	2014	Plant Sci	The present study was conducted to characterize the functions of the major starch synthase (SS) isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa in rice endosperm and their functional interaction with starch branching enzyme (BE), by using their purified recombinant proteins. All the SS isozymes had similarly significant activities toward branched glucans such as amylopecin and glycogen whereas they scarcely showed activities toward maltohexaose. In vitro studies indicate that SSI mainly attacked A and B chains with degree of polymerization (DP) of 6 and 7 in their external segments and elongated them to DP8. It is likely that SSIIa and SSIIIa produced wider ranges of intermediate chains and long chains, respectively. This study also revealed that without addition of exogenous primer, the glucan synthesis of SSI in the presence of ≧0.3 M citrate was accelerated by the addition of any of the rice BE isozymes- BEI, BEIIa, or BEIIb, whereas no such interaction occurred between SSIIa or SSIIIa with any of the BEs. The SSI-BE unprimed glucan synthesis absolutely required citrate. The interaction between SSI and BE was established by stimulation of SSI activity with BE and by activation of the BE activity by SSI.
24748226	Identification of novel and conserved microRNAs related to drought stress in potato by deep sequencing.	2014	PLoS One	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small, non-coding RNAs that play important roles in plant growth, development and stress response. There have been an increasing number of investigations aimed at discovering miRNAs and analyzing their functions in model plants (such as Arabidopsis thaliana and rice). In this research, we constructed small RNA libraries from both polyethylene glycol (PEG 6,000) treated and control potato samples, and a large number of known and novel miRNAs were identified. Differential expression analysis showed that 100 of the known miRNAs were down-regulated and 99 were up-regulated as a result of PEG stress, while 119 of the novel miRNAs were up-regulated and 151 were down-regulated. Based on target prediction, annotation and expression analysis of the miRNAs and their putative target genes, 4 miRNAs were identified as regulating drought-related genes (miR811, miR814, miR835, miR4398). Their target genes were MYB transcription factor (CV431094), hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (TC225721), quaporin (TC223412) and WRKY transcription factor (TC199112), respectively. Relative expression trends of those miRNAs were the same as that predicted by Solexa sequencing and they showed a negative correlation with the expression of the target genes. The results provide molecular evidence for the possible involvement of miRNAs in the process of drought response and/or tolerance in the potato plant.
24715609	Cloning a glutathione peroxidase gene from Nelumbo nucifera and enhanced salt tolerance by overexpressing in rice.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	A full-length cDNA clone encoding an 866 bp-length glutathione peroxidase protein (NnGPX) was isolated from lotus (Nelumbo nucifera L.). The deduced amino acid sequence of the NnGPX gene had significant homology with ATGPX6. A 3D structural model of the NnGPX was constructed by homology modeling. The cloned NnGPX gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and a fusion protein of about 40 kDa was detected after isopropyl thiogalactoside induction. Under different concentrations of Na2SeO3 treatments, NnGPX was found to be an enzyme that does not contain selenium. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the NnGPX gene was expressed in all organs of lotus, and its high expression mainly occurred in organs with active metabolisms. NnGPX transcript increased remarkably in response to cold, heat, mechanical damage, and salt treatment. Subsequently, the NnGPX gene was introduced in Oryza sativa cv. Yuetai B. PCR results verified the integration of this gene into the genome of rice and reverse transcription-PCR verified that this gene had been expressed in transgenic rice. The transgenic plants were significantly more tolerant to salt stress compared with the wild-type.
24743556	Accumulated expression level of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1 gene (OsGS1;1 or OsGS1;2) alter plant development and the carbon-nitrogen metabolic status in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Maintaining an appropriate balance of carbon to nitrogen metabolism is essential for rice growth and yield. Glutamine synthetase is a key enzyme for ammonium assimilation. In this study, we systematically analyzed the growth phenotype, carbon-nitrogen metabolic status and gene expression profiles in GS1;1-, GS1;2-overexpressing rice and wildtype plants. Our results revealed that the GS1;1-, GS1;2-overexpressing plants exhibited a poor plant growth phenotype and yield and decreased carbon/nitrogen ratio in the stem caused by the accumulation of nitrogen in the stem. In addition, the leaf SPAD value and photosynthetic parameters, soluble proteins and carbohydrates varied greatly in the GS1;1-, GS1;2-overexpressing plants. Furthermore, metabolite profile and gene expression analysis demonstrated significant changes in individual sugars, organic acids and free amino acids, and gene expression patterns in GS1;1-, GS1;2-overexpressing plants, which also indicated the distinct roles that these two GS1 genes played in rice nitrogen metabolism, particularly when sufficient nitrogen was applied in the environment. Thus, the unbalanced carbon-nitrogen metabolic status and poor ability of nitrogen transportation from stem to leaf in GS1;1-, GS1;2-overexpressing plants may explain the poor growth and yield.
24718783	GhPSY, a phytoene synthase gene, is related to the red plant phenotype in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Carotenoids are important accessory pigments in plants that are essential for photosynthesis. Phytoene synthase (PSY), a rate-controlling enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, has been widely characterized in rice, maize, and sorghum, but at present there are no reports describing this enzyme in cotton. In this study, GhPSY was identified as a candidate gene for the red plant phenotype via a combined strategy using: (1) molecular marker data for loci closely linked to R1; (2) the whole-genome scaffold sequence from Gossypium raimondii; (3) gene expression patterns in cotton accessions expressing the red plant and green plant phenotypes; and (4) the significant correlation between a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in GhPSY and leaf phenotypes of progeny in the (Sub16 × T586) F2 segregating population. GhPSY was relatively highly expressed in leaves, and the protein was localized to the plastid where it appeared to be mostly attached to the surface of thylakoid membranes. GhPSY mRNA was expressed at a significantly higher level in T586 and SL1-7-1 red plants than TM-1 and Hai7124 green plants. SNP analysis in the GhPSY locus showed co-segregation with the red and green plant phenotypes in the (Sub16 × T586) F2 segregating population. A phylogenetic analysis showed that GhPSY belongs to the PSY2 subfamily, which is related to photosynthesis in photosynthetic tissues. Using a reverse genetics approach based on Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing, we showed that the knockdown of GhPSY caused a highly uniform bleaching of the red color in newly-emerged leaves in both T586 and SL1-7-1 plants with a red plant phenotype. These findings indicate that GhPSY is important for engineering the carotenoid metabolic pathway in pigment production.
24821718	A novel chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in splicing affects chloroplast development and abiotic stress response in rice.	2014	Mol Plant	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family in higher plants and modulate organellar gene expression by participating in various aspects of organellar RNA metabolism. In rice, the family contains 477 members, and the majority of their functions remain unclear. In this study, we isolated and characterized a rice mutant, white stripe leaf (wsl), which displays chlorotic striations early in development. Map-based cloning revealed that WSL encodes a newly identified rice PPR protein which targets the chloroplasts. In wsl mutants, PEP-dependent plastid gene expression was significantly down-regulated, and plastid rRNAs and translation products accumulate to very low levels. Consistently with the observations, wsl shows a strong defect in the splicing of chloroplast transcript rpl2, resulting in aberrant transcript accumulation and its product reduction in the mutant. The wsl shows enhanced sensitivity to ABA, salinity, and sugar, and it accumulates more H2O2 than wild-type. These results suggest the reduced translation efficiency may affect the response of the mutant to abiotic stress.
24841201	Palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of the rice resistance protein pit is critical for the activation of the small GTPase OsRac1.	2014	J Biol Chem	Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family proteins function as intracellular immune sensors in both plants and animals. In plants, the downstream components activated by NLR family proteins and the immune response mechanisms induced by these downstream molecules are largely unknown. We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1, which acts as a molecular switch in rice immunity, is activated by Pit, an NLR-type resistance (R) protein to rice blast fungus, and this activation plays critical roles in Pit-mediated immunity. However, the sites and mechanisms of activation of Pit in vivo remain unknown. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the localization of Pit, we searched for consensus sequences in Pit that specify membrane localization and found a pair of potential palmitoylation sites in the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Although wild-type Pit was localized mainly to the plasma membrane, this membrane localization was compromised in a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of Pit. The palmitoylation-deficient Pit displayed significantly lower affinity for OsRac1 on the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in failures of the Pit-mediated cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and disease resistance to rice blast fungus. These results indicate that palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of Pit is required for the interaction with and the activation of OsRac1 and that OsRac1 activation by Pit is vital for Pit-mediated disease resistance to rice blast fungus.
24844783	Proportion of phospholipids in the plasma membrane is an important factor in Al tolerance.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	The negative charge on the plasma membrane (PM) is mainly derived from the phosphate group of phospholipids. One of the mechanisms of aluminum (Al) toxicity is to increase the PM permeability of root cells by binding to the negative sites on the PM. Thus, PM with a higher proportion of phospholipids could be more susceptible to Al toxicity. In our previous study, we showed that tolerance to Al and low-calcium in rice was enhanced by decreasing the proportion of phospholipids in root cells. Both Melastoma malabathricum L. and Melaleuca cajuputi Powell are dominant woody species that grow in tropical acid sulfate soils, and have been reported to be more tolerant to Al than rice. Surprisingly, the proportion of PM phospholipids in root cells of M. malabathricum and M. cajuputi was considerably low. Our present findings suggest that PM lipid composition plays an important role in Al tolerance mechanisms in various plant species.
25036830	Identification of interacting proteins for calcium-dependent protein kinase 8 by a novel screening system based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Protein kinases are key regulators of cell function that constitute one of the largest and most functionally diverse gene families. We developed a novel assay system, based on the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique in Escherichia coli, for detecting transient interactions such as those between kinases and their substrates. This system detected the interaction between OsMEK1 and its direct target OsMAP1. By contrast, BiFC fluorescence was not observed when OsMAP2 or OsMAP3, which are not substrates of OsMEK1, were used as prey proteins. We also screened for interacting proteins of calcium-dependent protein kinase 8 (OsCPK8), a regulator of plant immune responses, and identified three proteins as interacting molecules of OsCPK8. The interaction between OsCPK8 and two of these proteins (ARF-GEF and peptidyl prolyl isomerase) was confirmed in rice cells by means of BiFC technology. These results indicate that our new assay system has the potential to screen for protein kinase target molecules.
24808099	CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE4 Integrates Cytokinin and Auxin Signaling to Control Rice Crown Root Formation.	2014	Plant Physiol	Crown roots constitute the majority of the rice (Oryza sativa) root system and play an important role in rice growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism of crown root formation in rice is not well understood. Here, we characterized a rice dominant mutant, root enhancer1 (ren1-D), which was observed to exhibit a more robust root system, increased crown root number, and reduced plant height. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that these phenotypes are caused by the activation of a cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) family gene, OsCKX4. Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsCKX4 is a cytosolic isoform of CKX. OsCKX4 is predominantly expressed in leaf blades and roots. It is the dominant CKX, preferentially expressed in the shoot base where crown root primordia are produced, underlining its role in root initiation. OsCKX4 is induced by exogenous auxin and cytokinin in the roots. Furthermore, one-hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3. Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCKX4 confirmed that OsCKX4 plays a positive role in crown root formation. Moreover, expression analysis revealed a significant alteration in the expression of auxin-related genes in the ren1-D mutants, indicating that the OsCKX4 mediates crown root development by integrating the interaction between cytokinin and auxin. Transgenic plants harboring OsCKX4 under the control of the root-specific promoter RCc3 displayed enhanced root development without affecting their shoot parts, suggesting that this strategy could be a powerful tool in rice root engineering.
25055694	[Phytotoxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles to metabolic activity in the roots of rice].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	To study the toxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) on plant growth, the physiological and biochemical activities of rice (Oryza sativa L. ) seedlings were detected under different kinds of treatments (CuO NPs suspension, CuO BPs suspension and CuSO4 .5H2O solution), using distilled water (d H20) culture as contrast. The results showed that the response of rice roots to four treatments was very different. After treated with CuO NPs suspension, the rice roots were seriously damaged, the root activity obviously decreased, the MDA and H202 content rose, and the activity of SOD and POD apparently increased. The effect of different treatments on rice roots followed the order of CuO NPs > CuSO4 .5H2O2 > CuO BPs > d H2O. The results demonstrated that CuO NPs had a serious effect on the root growth of rice, the toxicity of nanoparticles on rice root was not only caused by the release of Cu ion, the particles also played an important role, and that oxidative damage might be one of the main toxic mechanisms of copper oxide nanoparticles.
24792034	OsLOX2, a rice type I lipoxygenase, confers opposite effects on seed germination and longevity.	2014	Transgenic Res	Rice production and seed storage are confronted with grain deterioration and loss of seed viability. Some members of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family function in degradation of storage lipids during the seed germination, but little is known about their influence on seed longevity during storage. We characterized the role of rice OsLOX2 gene in seed germination and longevity via over-expression and knock-down approaches. Abundant expression of OsLOX2 was detected in panicles, roots, and stems, but not in leaves. Moreover, OsLOX2 was highly induced during germination. OsLOX2 protein, located in the cytoplasm, showed a wide range of temperature adaptation (20-50 °C) and a substrate preference to linoleic acid. Lines over-expressing OsLOX2 showed accelerated seed germination under normal condition and lower seed viability after accelerated aging. RNA interference (RNAi) of OsLOX2 caused delayed germination and enhanced seed longevity. RNAi lines with strongly repressed OsLOX2 activity completely lost the capability of germination after accelerated aging. More lipid hydroperoxide were found in OE15 than the control, but less in RNAi lines than in the WT Nipponbare. Therefore, OsLOX2 acts in opposite directions during seed germination and longevity during storage. Appropriate repression of the OsLOX2 gene may delay the aging process during the storage without compromising germination under normal conditions.
24808924	Production of marker-free transgenic Jatropha curcas expressing hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxin Cry1Ab/1Ac for resistance to larvae of tortrix moth (Archips micaceanus).	2014	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: The potential biofuel plant Jatropha curcas L. is affected by larvae of Archips micaceanus (Walker), a moth of the family Tortricidae. The hybrid Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) δ-endotoxin protein Cry1Ab/1Ac confers resistance to lepidopteran insects in transgenic rice.

RESULTS: Here, we report the production of a marker-free transgenic line of J. curcas (L10) expressing Cry1Ab/1Ac using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and a chemically regulated, Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination system. L10 carries a single copy of marker-free T-DNA that contains the Cry1Ab/1Ac gene under the control of a maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene promoter (P Pepc :Cry1Ab/1Ac:T Nos ). The P Pepc :Cry1Ab/1Ac:T Nos gene was highly expressed in leaves of L10 plants. Insecticidal bioassays using leaf explants of L10 resulted in 80-100% mortality of larvae of A. micaceanus at 4 days after infestation.

CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the hybrid Bt δ-endotoxin protein Cry1Ab/1Ac expressed in Jatropha curcas displays strong insecticidal activity to A. micaceanus. The marker-free transgenic J. curcas line L10 can be used for breeding of insect resistance to A. micaceanus.
24886269	Identification and functional characterization of bidirectional gene pairs and their intergenic regions in maize.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Bidirectional gene pairs exist as a specific form of gene organization in microorganisms and mammals as well as in model plant species, such as Arabidopsis and rice. Little is known about bidirectional gene pairs in maize, which has a large genome and is one of the most important grain crops.

RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide search in maize using genome sequencing results from the inbred line B73. In total, 1696 bidirectional transcript pairs were identified using a modified search model. We functionally characterized the promoter activity of the intergenic regions of most of the bidirectional transcript pairs that were expressed in embryos using a maize embryo transient expression system. A comparative study of bidirectional gene pairs performed for three monocot (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Oryza sativa) and two dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max) plant genomes showed that bidirectional gene pairs were abundant in the five plant species. Orthologous bidirectional gene pairs were clearly distinguishable between the monocot and dicot species although the total numbers of orthologous bidirectional genes were similar. Analysis of the gene pairs using the Blast2GO software suite showed that the molecular functions (MF), cellular components (CC), and biological processes (BP) associated with the bidirectional transcripts were similar among the five plant species.

CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary analysis of the function and structure of orthologous bidirectional gene pairs in various plant species revealed a potential pathway of their origin, which may be required for the evolution of a new species.
24817160	A novel maize homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) I gene, Zmhdz10, positively regulates drought and salt tolerance in both rice and Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Increasing evidence suggests that homeodomain-leucine zipper I (HD-Zip) I transcription factors play important roles in abiotic stress responses, but no HD-Zip I proteins have been reported in maize. Here, a drought-induced HD-Zip I gene, Zmhdz10, was isolated from maize and characterized for its role in stress responses. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of Zmhdz10 was also induced by salt stress and ABA. Transient expression of Zmhdz10-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in onion cells showed a nuclear localization of Zmhdz10. Yeast hybrid assays demonstrated that Zmhdz10 has transactivation and DNA-binding activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of Zmhdz10 in rice led to enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses and increased sensitivity to ABA. Moreover, Zmhdz10 transgenic plants had lower relative electrolyte leakage (REL), lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased proline content relative to wild-type plants under stress conditions, which may contribute to enhanced stress tolerance. Zmhdz10 transgenic Arabidopsis plants also exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses that was concomitant with altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes, including Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1), Responsive to dehydration 22 (RD22), Responsive to dehydration 29B (RD29B) and ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1). Taken together, these results suggest that Zmhdz10 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can positively regulate drought and salt tolerance in plants through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway.
24904618	Transcription regulation by CHD proteins to control plant development.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA (CHD)-binding proteins have been characterized in various species as important transcription regulators by their chromatin remodeling activity. However, in plant the function of these proteins has hardly been analyzed before except that Arabidopsis PIKLE and rice CHR729 are identified to play critical roles in the regulation of series of genes involved in developmental or stress responding process. In this review we focus on how plant CHD proteins regulate gene expression and the role of these proteins in controlling plant development and stress response.
24920973	Genetic and physiological analysis of tolerance to acute iron toxicity in rice.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Fe toxicity occurs in lowland rice production due to excess ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) formation in reduced soils. To contribute to the breeding for tolerance to Fe toxicity in rice, we determined quantitative trait loci (QTL) by screening two different bi-parental mapping populations under iron pulse stresses (1,000 mg L(-1) = 17.9 mM Fe(2+) for 5 days) in hydroponic solution, followed by experiments with selected lines to determine whether QTLs were associated with iron exclusion (i.e. root based mechanisms), or iron inclusion (i.e. shoot-based mechanisms).

RESULTS: In an IR29/Pokkali F8 recombinant inbred population, 7 QTLs were detected for leaf bronzing score on chromosome 1, 2, 4, 7 and 12, respectively, individually explaining 9.2-18.7% of the phenotypic variation. Two tolerant recombinant inbred lines carrying putative QTLs were selected for further experiments. Based on Fe uptake into the shoot, the dominant tolerance mechanism of the tolerant line FL510 was determined to be exclusion with its root architecture being conducive to air transport and thus the ability to oxidize Fe(2+) in rhizosphere. In line FL483, the iron tolerance was related mainly to shoot-based mechanisms (tolerant inclusion mechanism). In a Nipponbare/Kasalath/Nipponbare backcross inbred population, 3 QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1, 3 and 8, respectively. These QTLs explained 11.6-18.6% of the total phenotypic variation. The effect of QTLs on chromosome 1 and 3 were confirmed by using chromosome segment substitution lines (SL), carrying Kasalath introgressions in the genetic background on Nipponbare. The Fe uptake in shoots of substitution lines suggests that the effect of the QTL on chromosome 1 was associated with shoot tolerance while the QTL on chromosome 3 was associated with iron exclusion.

CONCLUSION: Tolerance of certain genotypes were classified into shoot- and root- based mechanisms. Comparing our findings with previously reported QTLs for iron toxicity tolerance, we identified co-localization for some QTLs in both pluse and chronic stresses, especially on chromosome 1.
24788204	Fine mapping of qRC10-2, a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance of rice roots at seedling and mature stages.	2014	PLoS One	UNLABELLED: Cold stress causes various injuries to rice seedlings in low-temperature and high-altitude areas and is therefore an important factor affecting rice production in such areas. In this study, root conductivity (RC) was used as an indicator to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of cold tolerance in Oryza rufipogon Griff., Dongxiang wild rice (DX), at its two-leaf stage. The correlation coefficients between RC and the plant survival rate (PSR) at the seedling and maturity stages were -0.85 and -0.9 (P = 0.01), respectively, indicating that RC is a reliable index for evaluating cold tolerance of rice. A preliminary mapping group was constructed from 151 BC2F1 plants using DX as a cold-tolerant donor and the indica variety Nanjing 11 (NJ) as a recurrent parent. A total of 113 codominant simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed, with a parental polymorphism of 17.3%. Two cold-tolerant QTLs, named qRC10-1 and qRC10-2 were detected on chromosome 10 by composite interval mapping. qRC10-1 (LOD = 3.1, RM171-RM1108) was mapped at 148.3 cM, and qRC10-2 (LOD = 6.1, RM25570-RM304) was mapped at 163.3 cM, which accounted for 9.4% and 32.1% of phenotypic variances, respectively. To fine map the major locus qRC10-2, NJ was crossed with a BC4F2 plant (L188-3), which only carried the QTL qRC10-2, to construct a large BC5F2 fine-mapping population with 13,324 progenies. Forty-five molecular markers were designed to evenly cover qRC10-2, and 10 markers showed polymorphisms between DX and NJ. As a result, qRC10-2 was delimited to a 48.5-kb region between markers qc45 and qc48. In this region, Os10g0489500 and Os10g0490100 exhibited different expression patterns between DX and NJ. Our results provide a basis for identifying the gene(s) underlying qRC10-2, and the markers developed here may be used to improve low-temperature tolerance of rice seedling and maturity stages via marker-assisted selection (MAS).

KEY MESSAGE: With root electrical conductivity used as a cold-tolerance index, the quantitative trait locus qRC10-2 was fine mapped to a 48.5-kb candidate region, and Os10g0489500 and Os10g0490100 were identified as differently expressed genes for qRC10-2.
24920971	Gene targeting using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated CRISPR-Cas system in rice.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is a novel molecular tool for site-specific genome modification. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was recently introduced into plants by transient or stable transformation.

FINDINGS: Here, we report gene targeting in rice via the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 system. Three 20-nt CRISPR RNAs were designed to pair with diverse sites followed by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of the rice herbicide resistance gene BEL. After integrating the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 cassette in a single binary vector, transgenic rice plants harboring sgRNA:Cas9 were generated by A. tumefaciens-mediated stable transformation. By analyzing the targeting site on the genome of corresponding transgenic plants, the mutations were determined. The mutagenesis efficiency was varied from ~2% to ~16%. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis revealed that the biallelic mutated transgenic plant was sensitive to bentazon.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the agricultural trait could be purposely modified by sgRNA:Cas9-induced gene targeting. CRISPR-Cas9 system could be exploited as a powerful tool for trait improvements in crop breeding.
24904616	Putative sugarcane FT/TFL1 genes delay flowering time and alter reproductive architecture in Arabidopsis.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Agriculturally important grasses such as rice, maize, and sugarcane are evolutionarily distant from Arabidopsis, yet some components of the floral induction process are highly conserved. Flowering in sugarcane is an important factor that negatively affects cane yield and reduces sugar/ethanol production from this important perennial bioenergy crop. Comparative studies have facilitated the identification and characterization of putative orthologs of key flowering time genes in sugarcane, a complex polyploid plant whose genome has yet to be sequenced completely. Using this approach we identified phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) gene family members in sugarcane that are similar to the archetypical FT and TFL1 genes of Arabidopsis that play an essential role in controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Expression analysis of ScTFL1, which falls into the TFL1-clade of floral repressors, showed transcripts in developing leaves surrounding the shoot apex but not at the apex itself. ScFT1 was detected in immature leaves and apical regions of vegetatively growing plants and, after the floral transition, expression also occurred in mature leaves. Ectopic over-expression of ScTFL1 in Arabidopsis caused delayed flowering in Arabidopsis, as might be expected for a gene related to TFL1. In addition, lines with the latest flowering phenotype exhibited aerial rosette formation. Unexpectedly, over-expression of ScFT1, which has greatest similarity to the florigen-encoding FT, also caused a delay in flowering. This preliminary analysis of divergent sugarcane FT and TFL1 gene family members from Saccharum spp. suggests that their expression patterns and roles in the floral transition has diverged from the predicted role of similar PEBP family members.
24885138	Genome-wide response to selection and genetic basis of cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Cold stress is an important factor limiting rice yield in many areas of high latitude and altitude. Considerable efforts have been taken to genetically dissect cold tolerance (CT) in rice using DNA markers. Because of possible epistasis and gene × environment interactions associated with identified quantitative trait loci, the results of these genetic studies have unfortunately not been directly applicable to marker-assisted selection for improved rice CT. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of a selective introgression strategy for simultaneous improvement and genetic dissection of rice seedling CT.

RESULTS: A set of japonica introgression lines (ILs) with significantly improved seedling CT were developed from four backcross populations based on two rounds of selection. Genetic characterization of these cold-tolerant ILs revealed two important aspects of genome-wide responses to strong phenotypic selection for rice CT: (1) significant over-introgression of donor alleles at 57 loci in 29 functional genetic units (FGUs) across the rice genome and (2) pronounced non-random associations between or among alleles at many unlinked CT loci. Linkage disequilibrium analyses of the detected CT loci allowed us to construct putative genetic networks (multi-locus structures) underlying the seedling CT of rice. Each network consisted of a single FGU, with high introgression as the putative regulator plus two to three groups of highly associated downstream FGUs. A bioinformatics search of rice genomic regions harboring these putative regulators identified a small set of candidate regulatory genes that are known to be involved in plant stress response.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CT in rice is controlled by multiple pathways. Genetic complementarity between parental-derived functional alleles at many loci within a given pathway provides an appropriate explanation for the commonly observed hidden diversity and transgressive segregation of CT and other complex traits in rice.
24820172	Comparative systems biology reveals allelic variation modulating Tocochromanol profiles in Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).	2014	PLoS One	Tocochromanols are recognized for nutritional content, plant stress response, and seed longevity. Here we present a systems biological approach to characterize and develop predictive assays for genes affecting tocochromanol variation in barley. Major QTL, detected in three regions of a SNP linkage map, affected multiple tocochromanol forms. Candidate genes were identified through barley/rice orthology and sequenced in genotypes with disparate tocochromanol profiles. Gene-specific markers, designed based on observed polymorphism, mapped to the originating QTL, increasing R2 values at the respective loci. Polymorphism within promoter regions corresponded to motifs known to influence gene expression. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed a trend of increased expression in tissues grown at cold temperatures. These results demonstrate utility of a novel method for rapid gene identification and characterization, and provide a resource for efficient development of barley lines with improved tocochromanol profiles.
24884377	CONSTANS is a photoperiod regulated activator of flowering in sorghum.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Sorghum genotypes used for grain production in temperate regions are photoperiod insensitive and flower early avoiding adverse environments during the reproductive phase. In contrast, energy sorghum hybrids are highly photoperiod sensitive with extended vegetative phases in long days, resulting in enhanced biomass accumulation. SbPRR37 and SbGHD7 contribute to photoperiod sensitivity in sorghum by repressing expression of SbEHD1 and FT-like genes, thereby delaying flowering in long days with minimal influence in short days (PNAS_108:16469-16474, 2011; Plant Genome_in press, 2014). The GIGANTEA (GI)-CONSTANS (CO)-FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) pathway regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis and the grasses (J Exp Bot_62:2453-2463, 2011). In long day flowering plants, such as Arabidopsis and barley, CONSTANS activates FT expression and flowering in long days. In rice, a short day flowering plant, Hd1, the ortholog of CONSTANS, activates flowering in short days and represses flowering in long days.

RESULTS: Quantitative trait loci (QTL) that modify flowering time in sorghum were identified by screening Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) derived from BTx642 and Tx7000 in long days, short days, and under field conditions. Analysis of the flowering time QTL on SBI-10 revealed that BTx642 encodes a recessive CONSTANS allele containing a His106Tyr substitution in B-box 2 known to inactivate CONSTANS in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic analysis characterized sorghum CONSTANS as a floral activator that promotes flowering by inducing the expression of EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (SbEHD1) and sorghum orthologs of the maize FT genes ZCN8 (SbCN8) and ZCN12 (SbCN12). The floral repressor PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR PROTEIN 37 (PRR37) inhibits sorghum CONSTANS activity and flowering in long days.

CONCLUSION: Sorghum CONSTANS is an activator of flowering that is repressed post-transcriptionally in long days by the floral inhibitor PRR37, contributing to photoperiod sensitive flowering in Sorghum bicolor, a short day plant.
24821956	Differential expression of Nrat1 is responsible for Al-tolerance QTL on chromosome 2 in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	Although rice (Oryza sativa) is the most Al-tolerant species among small-grain cereal crops, there is wide genotypic variation in its tolerance to Al toxicity. A number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al tolerance have been detected, but the responsible genes have not been identified. By using chromosome segment substitution lines, this work found that Nrat1, a gene encoding an Al transporter, is responsible for a QTL previously detected on chromosome 2. Substitution of the chromosome segment containing Nrat1 from Koshihikari (Al-tolerant variety) by that from Kasalath (Al-sensitive variety) decreased Nrat1 expression and Al uptake and tolerance, but increased binding of Al to the cell wall. Nrat1 in Kasalath showed tissue localization similar to Koshihikari in the roots. Although Koshihikari and Kasalath differed in four amino acids in Nrat1 protein, Nrat1 from Kasalath also showed transport activity for Al. Analysis with site-directed mutagenesis revealed that these differences did not affect the Al-transport activity much. Furthermore, there was no correlation between Al tolerance and the open-reading-frame sequence differences in other rice varieties. On the other hand, there was good correlation between Nrat1 expression and Al tolerance; however, sequence comparison of the promoter region up to 2.1kb did not give a clear difference between the Al-tolerant and -sensitive varieties. Taken together, these results indicate that differential expression of Nrat1 is responsible for the QTL for Al tolerance on chromosome 2, although the mechanism controlling Nrat1 expression remains to be examined.
24949276	Physiological and growth response of rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) to Trichoderma spp. inoculants.	2014	AMB Express	Trichoderma spp., a known beneficial fungus is reported to have several mechanisms to enhance plant growth. In this study, the effectiveness of seven isolates of Trichoderma spp. to promote growth and increase physiological performance in rice was evaluated experimentally using completely randomized design under greenhouse condition. This study indicated that all the Trichoderma spp. isolates tested were able to increase several rice physiological processes which include net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, internal CO2 concentration and water use efficiency. These Trichoderma spp. isolates were also able to enhance rice growth components including plant height, leaf number, tiller number, root length and root fresh weight. Among the Trichoderma spp. isolates, Trichoderma sp. SL2 inoculated rice plants exhibited greater net photosynthetic rate (8.66 μmolCO2 m(-2) s(-1)), internal CO2 concentration (336.97 ppm), water use efficiency (1.15 μmoCO2/mmoH2O), plant height (70.47 cm), tiller number (12), root length (22.5 cm) and root fresh weight (15.21 g) compared to the plants treated with other Trichoderma isolates tested. We conclude that beneficial fungi can be used as a potential growth promoting agent in rice cultivation.
24853557	The phytochrome B/phytochrome C heterodimer is necessary for phytochrome C-mediated responses in rice seedlings.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: PhyC levels have been observed to be markedly lower in phyB mutants than in Arabidopsis or rice wild type etiolated seedlings, but the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated.

RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which phyB affects the protein concentration and photo-sensing abilities of phyC and demonstrated that rice phyC exists predominantly as phyB/phyC heterodimers in etiolated seedlings. PHYC-GFP protein was detected when expressed in phyA phyC mutants, but not in phyA phyB mutants, suggesting that phyC requires phyB for its photo-sensing abilities. Interestingly, when a mutant PHYB gene that has no chromophore binding site, PHYB(C364A), was introduced into phyB mutants, the phyC level was restored. Moreover, when PHYB(C364A) was introduced into phyA phyB mutants, the seedlings exhibited de-etiolation under both far-red light (FR) and red light (R) conditions, while the phyA phyB mutants were blind to both FR and R. These results are the first direct evidence that phyC is responsible for regulating seedling de-etiolation under both FR and R. These findings also suggest that phyB is indispensable for the expression and function of phyC, which depends on the formation of phyB/phyC heterodimers.

SIGNIFICANCE: The present report clearly demonstrates the similarities and differences in the properties of phyC between Arabidopsis and rice and will advance our understanding of phytochrome functions in monocots and dicots.
24847340	Changes in free polyamine levels, expression of polyamine biosynthesis genes, and performance of rice cultivars under salt stress: a comparison with responses to drought.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Soil salinity affects a large proportion of rural area and limits agricultural productivity. To investigate differential adaptation to soil salinity, we studied salt tolerance of 18 varieties of Oryza sativa using a hydroponic culture system. Based on visual inspection and photosynthetic parameters, cultivars were classified according to their tolerance level. Additionally, biomass parameters were correlated with salt tolerance. Polyamines have frequently been demonstrated to be involved in plant stress responses and therefore soluble leaf polyamines were measured. Under salinity, putrescine (Put) content was unchanged or increased in tolerant, while dropped in sensitive cultivars. Spermidine (Spd) content was unchanged at lower NaCl concentrations in all, while reduced at 100 mM NaCl in sensitive cultivars. Spermine (Spm) content was increased in all cultivars. A comparison with data from 21 cultivars under long-term, moderate drought stress revealed an increase of Spm under both stress conditions. While Spm became the most prominent polyamine under drought, levels of all three polyamines were relatively similar under salt stress. Put levels were reduced under both, drought and salt stress, while changes in Spd were different under drought (decrease) or salt (unchanged) conditions. Regulation of polyamine metabolism at the transcript level during exposure to salinity was studied for genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines and compared to expression under drought stress. Based on expression profiles, investigated genes were divided into generally stress-induced genes (ADC2, SPD/SPM2, SPD/SPM3), one generally stress-repressed gene (ADC1), constitutively expressed genes (CPA1, CPA2, CPA4, SAMDC1, SPD/SPM1), specifically drought-induced genes (SAMDC2, AIH), one specifically drought-repressed gene (CPA3) and one specifically salt-stress repressed gene (SAMDC4), revealing both overlapping and specific stress responses under these conditions.
24817546	A model framework for identifying genes that guide the evolution of heterochrony.	2014	Mol Biol Evol	Heterochrony, the phylogenic change in the time of developmental events or rate of development, has been thought to play an important role in producing phenotypic novelty during evolution. Increasing evidence suggests that specific genes are implicated in heterochrony, guiding the process of developmental divergence, but no quantitative models have been instrumented to map such heterochrony genes. Here, we present a computational framework for genetic mapping by which to characterize and locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that govern heterochrony described by four parameters, the timing of the inflection point, the timing of maximum acceleration of growth, the timing of maximum deceleration of growth, and the length of linear growth. The framework was developed from functional mapping, a dynamic model derived to map QTLs for the overall process and pattern of development. By integrating an optimality algorithm, the framework allows the so-called heterochrony QTLs (hQTLs) to be tested and quantified. Specific pipelines are given for testing how hQTLs control the onset and offset of developmental events, the rate of development, and duration of a particular developmental stage. Computer simulation was performed to examine the statistical properties of the model and demonstrate its utility to characterize the effect of hQTLs on population diversification due to heterochrony. By analyzing a genetic mapping data in rice, the framework identified an hQTL that controls the timing of maximum growth rate and duration of linear growth stage in plant height growth. The framework provides a tool to study how genetic variation translates into phenotypic innovation, leading a lineage to evolve, through heterochrony.
25069161	Exogenous ascorbic acid and glutathione alleviate oxidative stress induced by salt stress in the chloroplasts of Oryza sativa L.	None	Z Naturforsch C	The effects of exogenous ascorbic acid (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) on antioxidant enzyme activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR)] and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2, as well as of endogenous AsA and GSH, in the chloroplasts of two rice cultivars, the salt-tolerant cultivar Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Peta, were investigated. Exogenous AsA and GSH enhanced SOD, APX, and GR activities, increased endogenous AsA and GSH contents, and reduced those of H2O2 and MDA in the chloroplasts of both cultivars under salt stress (200 mM NaCl), but the effects were significantly more pronounced in cv. Pokkali. GSH acted more strongly than AsA on the plastidial reactive oxygen scavenging systems. These results indicated that exogenous AsA and GSH differentially enhanced salinity tolerance and alleviated salinity-induced damage in the two rice cultivars.
24904613	Genetic architecture of main effect QTL for heading date in European winter wheat.	2014	Front Plant Sci	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for heading date (HD) was performed with a panel of 358 European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties through the phenotypic evaluation of HD in field tests in eight environments. Genotyping data consisted of 770 mapped microsatellite loci and 7934 mapped SNP markers derived from the 90K iSelect wheat chip. Best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) were calculated across all trials and ranged from 142.5 to 159.6 days after the 1st of January with an average value of 151.4 days. Considering only associations with a -log10 (P-value) ≥ 3.0, a total of 340 SSR and 2983 SNP marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a total of 72 SSR and 438 SNP marker-trait associations remained significant. Highly significant MTAs were detected for the photoperiodism gene Ppd-D1, which was genotyped in all varieties. Consistent associations were found on all chromosomes with the highest number of MTAs on chromosome 5B. Linear regression showed a clear dependence of the HD score BLUEs on the number of favorable alleles (decreasing HD) and unfavorable alleles (increasing HD) per variety meaning that genotypes with a higher number of favorable or a low number of unfavorable alleles showed lower HD and therefore flowered earlier. For the vernalization gene Vrn-A2 co-locating MTAs on chromosome 5A, as well as for the photoperiodism genes Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 on chromosomes 2A and 2B were detected. After the construction of an integrated map of the SSR and SNP markers and by exploiting the synteny to sequenced species, such as rice and Brachypodium distachyon, we were able to demonstrate that a marker locus on wheat chromosome 5BL with homology to the rice photoperiodism gene Hd6 played a significant role in the determination of the heading date in wheat.
24850835	Physiological functions of PsbS-dependent and PsbS-independent NPQ under naturally fluctuating light conditions.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	The PsbS protein plays an important role in dissipating excess light energy as heat in photosystem II (PSII). However, the physiological importance of PsbS under naturally fluctuating light has not been quantitatively estimated. Here we investigated energy allocation in PSII in PsbS-suppressed rice transformants (ΔpsbS) under both naturally fluctuating and constant light conditions. Under constant light, PsbS was essential for inducing the rapid formation of light-inducible thermal dissipation (Φ(NPQ)), which consequently suppressed the rapid formation of basal intrinsic decay (Φ(f,D)), while the quantum yield of electron transport (Φ(II)) did not change. In the steady state phase, the difference between the wild type (WT) and ΔpsbS was minimized. Under regularly fluctuating light, the reduced PsbS resulted in higher Φ(II) upon the transition from high light to low light and in lower Φ(II) upon the transition from low light to high light, indicating that Φ(II) was, to some extent, controlled by PsbS. Under naturally fluctuating light in a greenhouse, rapid changes in Φ(II) were compensated by Φ(NPQ) in the WT, but by Φ(f,D) in ΔpsbS. As a consequence, a significantly lower ΣNPQ integrated Φ(NPQ) over a whole day) and higher Σf,D were found in ΔpsbS. Furthermore, thermal dissipation associated with photoinhibtion was enhanced in ΔpsbS. These results suggest that PsbS plays an important role in photoprotective process at the induction phase of photosynthesis as well as under field conditions. The physiological relevance of PsbS as a photoprotection mechanism and the identities of Φ(NPQ) and Φ(f,D) are discussed.
24748469	The detection of T-Nos, a genetic element present in GMOs, by cross-priming isothermal amplification with real-time fluorescence.	2014	Anal Bioanal Chem	An isothermal cross-priming amplification (CPA) assay for Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator (T-Nos) was established and investigated in this work. A set of six specific primers, recognizing eight distinct regions on the T-Nos sequence, was designed. The CPA assay was performed at a constant temperature, 63 °C, and detected by real-time fluorescence. The results indicated that real-time fluorescent CPA had high specificity, and the limit of detection was 1.06 × 10(3) copies of rice genomic DNA, which could be detected in 40 min. Comparison of real-time fluorescent CPA and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed. Results revealed that real-time fluorescent CPA had a comparable sensitivity to conventional real-time PCR and had taken a shorter time. In addition, different contents of genetically modified (GM)-contaminated rice seed powder samples were detected for practical application. The result showed real-time fluorescent CPA could detect 0.5 % GM-contaminated samples at least, and the whole reaction could be finished in 35 min. Real-time fluorescent CPA is sensitive enough to monitor labeling systems and provides an attractive method for the detection of GMO.
24863060	Characterization of a plant (rice) translin and its comparative analysis with human translin.	2014	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: For the first time, a plant (rice) translin was characterized. The rice translin protein, which was octameric in native state, bound efficiently to single-stranded DNA and RNA. Translin, a DNA-/RNA-binding protein, is expressed in brain, testis and in certain malignancies. It is involved in chromosomal translocation, mRNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation and telomere protection. Studies from human, mice, drosophila and yeast have revealed that it forms an octameric ring, which is important for its function. In spite of the absence of neuronal functions and cancer processes, translin is present in plant systems, but information on plant translin is lacking. Here we report the characterization of a plant (rice) translin. Translin cDNA from O. sativa was cloned into an expression vector; protein was over-expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified to homogeneity. Circular dichroism and homology-based modeling showed that the rice translin protein was similar to the other translin proteins. Native PAGE and gel-filtration analyses showed rice translin to form an octamer and this octameric assembly was independent of disulphide bonds. Rice translin bound to single-stranded DNA sequences like human translin, but not to the double-stranded DNA. Rice translin bound more efficiently to linear DNA (with staggered ends) than open or closed circular DNA. Rice translin also bound to RNA, like its human counterpart. Rice translin displays all the characteristic properties of the translin group of proteins and does indeed qualify as a bonafide "translin" protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report wherein the translin protein from a plant source has been functionally characterized. Understanding the translin biology from plant systems will give the new insights into its functional role during plant development.
24841958	Phenotypic screening and molecular analysis of blast resistance in fragrant rice for marker assisted selection.	2014	C R Biol	Experiments were conducted to identify blast-resistant fragrant genotypes for the development of a durable blast-resistant rice variety during years 2012-2013. The results indicate that out of 140 test materials including 114 fragrant germplasms, 25 differential varieties (DVs) harbouring 23 blast-resistant genes, only 16 fragrant rice germplasms showed comparatively better performance against a virulent isolate of blast disease. The reaction pattern of single-spore isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae to differential varieties showed that Pish, Pi9, Pita-2 and Pita are the effective blast-resistant genes against the tested blast isolates in Bangladesh. The DNA markers profiles of selected 16 rice germplasms indicated that genotype Chinigura contained Pish, Pi9 and Pita genes; on the other hand, both BRRI dhan50 and Bawaibhog contained Pish and Pita genes in their genetic background. Genotypes Jirakatari, BR5, and Gopalbhog possessed Pish gene, while Uknimodhu, Deshikatari, Radhunipagol, Kalijira (3), Chinikanai each contained the Pita gene only. There are some materials that did not contain any target gene(s) in their genetic background, but proved resistant in pathogenicity tests. This information provided valuable genetic information for breeders to develop durable blast-resistant fragrant or aromatic rice varieties in Bangladesh.
25110131	Plant growth-promoting traits of epiphytic and endophytic yeasts isolated from rice and sugar cane leaves in Thailand.	2014	Fungal Biol	A total of 1035 yeast isolates, obtained from rice and sugar cane leaves, were screened primarily for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production. Thirteen isolates were selected, due to their IAA production ranging from 1.2 to 29.3 mg g(-)(1) DCW. These isolates were investigated for their capabilities of calcium phosphate and ZnO(3) solubilisation, and also for production of NH(3), polyamine, and siderophore. Their 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, catalase and fungal cell wall-degrading enzyme activities were assessed. Their antagonism against rice fungal pathogens was also evaluated. Strain identification, based on molecular taxonomy, of the thirteen yeast isolates revealed that four yeast species - i.e. Hannaella sinensis (DMKU-RP45), Cryptococcus flavus (DMKU-RE12, DMKU-RE19, DMKU-RE67, and DMKU-RP128), Rhodosporidium paludigenum (DMKU-RP301) and Torulaspora globosa (DMKU-RP31) - were capable of high IAA production. Catalase activity was detected in all yeast strains tested. The yeast R. paludigenum DMKU-RP301 was the best IAA producer, yielding 29.3 mg g(-)(1) DCW, and showed the ability to produce NH3 and siderophore. Different levels of IAA production (7.2-9.7 mg g(-)(1) DCW) were found in four strains of C. flavus DMKU-RE12, DMKU-RE19, and DMKU-RE67, which are rice leaf endophytes, and strain DMKU-RP128, which is a rice leaf epiphyte. NH(3) production and carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity was also detected in these four strains. Antagonism to fungal plant pathogens and production of antifungal volatile compounds were exhibited in T. globosa DMKU-RP31, as well as a moderate level of IAA production (4.9 mg g(-)(1) DCW). The overall results indicated that T. globosa DMKU-RP31 might be used in two ways: enhancing plant growth and acting as a biocontrol agent. In addition, four C. flavus were also found to be strains of interest for optimal IAA production.
24852039	Transgenic rice as bioreactor for production of the Candida antarctica lipase B.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) is a versatile biocatalyst used for a wide range of biotransformation. Methods for low cost production of this enzyme are highly desirable. Here, we report a mass production method of CALB using transgenic rice seeds as the bioreactor. The transgenic rice transformed with the CALB gene under the control of the promoter of the rice seed storage protein GT1 was found to have accumulated a large quantity of CALB in seeds. The transgenic line with the highest lipolytic activity reached to 85 units per gram of dry seeds. One unit is defined as the amount of lipase necessary to liberate 1 μmol p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl butyrate in 1 min. The rice recombinant lipase (rOsCALB) from this line represents 40% of the total soluble proteins in the crude seed extracts. The enzyme purified from the rice seeds had an optimal temperature of 40 °C, and optimal pH of 8.5, similar to that of the fermentation products. Test of its conversion ability as a biocatalyst for biodiesel production suggested that rOsCALB is functionally identical to the fermentation products in its industrial application.
24840865	Regulation of jasmonic acid biosynthesis by silicon application during physical injury to Oryza sativa L.	2014	J Plant Res	We investigated the effects of silicon (Si) application on rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) and its responses in the regulation of jasmonic acid (JA) during wounding stress. Endogenous JA was significantly higher in wounded rice plants than in non-wounded. In contrast, Si treatment significantly reduced JA synthesis as compared to non-Si applications under wounding stress. mRNA expression of O. sativa genes showed down-regulation of lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase 1, allene oxide synthase 2, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3, and allene oxide cyclase upon Si application and wounding stress as compared to non-Si-treated wounded rice plants. The physical injury-induced-oxidative stress was modulated by Si treatments, which resulted in higher catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase activities as compared with non-Si-treated plants under wounding stress. The higher Si accumulation in rice plants also reduced the level of lipid peroxidation, which helped the rice plants to protect it from wounding stress. In conclusion, Si accumulation in rice plants mitigated the adverse effects of wounding through regulation of antioxidants and JA.
24819712	Physiological and proteomic alterations in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings under hexavalent chromium stress.	2014	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Rice plants employ two strategies to cope with Cr toxicity: immobilizing Cr ions into cell walls to reduce its translocation and activating antioxidant defense to mitigate Cr-induced oxidative stress. The investigation aimed at understanding the physiological and proteomic responses of rice seedlings to hexavalent chromium (Cr(6+)) stress was conducted using two rice genotypes, which differ in Cr tolerance and accumulation. Cr toxicity (200 µM) heavily increased the accumulation of H2O2 and [Formula: see text], enhanced lipid peroxidation, decreased cell viability and consequently inhibited rice plant growth. Proteomic analyses suggest that the response of rice proteome to Cr stress is genotype- and Cr dosage-dependent and tissue specific. Sixty-four proteins, which show more than fourfold difference under either two Cr levels, have been successfully identified. They are involved in a range of cellular processes, including cell wall synthesis, energy production, primary metabolism, electron transport and detoxification. Two proteins related to cell wall structure, NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase and reversibly glycosylated polypeptide were greatly up-regulated by Cr stress. Their enhancements coupled with callose accumulation by Cr suggest that cell wall is an important barrier for rice plants to resist Cr stress. Some enzymes involved in antioxidant defense, such as ferredoxin-NADP reductase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase I (Gly I) and glutamine synthetase 1 (GS1) have also been identified in response to Cr stress. However, they were only detected in Cr-tolerant genotype, indicating the genotypic difference in the capacity of activating the defense system to fight against Cr-induced oxidative stress. Overall, two strategies in coping with Cr stress in rice plants can be hypothesized: (i) immobilizing Cr ions into cell walls to reduce its translocation and (ii) activating antioxidant defense to mitigate Cr-induced oxidative stress.
24795339	LSCHL4 from Japonica Cultivar, which is allelic to NAL1, increases yield of indica super rice 93-11.	2014	Mol Plant	The basic premise of high yield in rice is to improve leaf photosynthetic efficiency and coordinate the source-sink relationship in rice plants. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to morphological traits and chlorophyll content of rice leaves were detected at the stages of heading to maturity, and a major QTL (qLSCHL4) related to flag leaf shape and chlorophyll content was detected at both stages in recombinant inbred lines constructed using the indica rice cultivar 93-11 and the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Map-based cloning and expression analysis showed that LSCHL4 is allelic to NAL1, a gene previously reported in narrow leaf mutant of rice. Overexpression lines transformed with vector carrying LSCHL4 from Nipponbare and a near-isogenic line of 93-11 (NIL-9311) had significantly increased leaf chlorophyll content, enlarged flag leaf size, and improved panicle type. The average yield of NIL-9311 was 18.70% higher than that of 93-11. These results indicate that LSCHL4 had a pleiotropic function. Exploring and pyramiding more high-yield alleles resembling LSCHL4 for super rice breeding provides an effective way to achieve new breakthroughs in raising rice yield and generate new ideas for solving the problem of global food safety.
24840062	Transcriptome profiling and physiological studies reveal a major role for aromatic amino acids in mercury stress tolerance in rice seedlings.	2014	PLoS One	Mercury (Hg) is a serious environmental pollution threat to the planet. The accumulation of Hg in plants disrupts many cellular-level functions and inhibits growth and development, but the mechanism is not fully understood. To gain more insight into the cellular response to Hg, we performed a large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during Hg stress. Genes induced with short-term exposure represented functional categories of cell-wall formation, chemical detoxification, secondary metabolism, signal transduction and abiotic stress response. Moreover, Hg stress upregulated several genes involved in aromatic amino acids (Phe and Trp) and increased the level of free Phe and Trp content. Exogenous application of Phe and Trp to rice roots enhanced tolerance to Hg and effectively reduced Hg-induced production of reactive oxygen species. Hg induced calcium accumulation and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Further characterization of the Hg-responsive genes we identified may be helpful for better understanding the mechanisms of Hg in plants.
24885019	Genomic regions involved in yield potential detected by genome-wide association analysis in Japanese high-yielding rice cultivars.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: High-yielding cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been developed in Japan from crosses between overseas indica and domestic japonica cultivars. Recently, next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping systems have shown many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are proving useful for detailed analysis of genome composition. These SNPs can be used in genome-wide association studies to detect candidate genome regions associated with economically important traits. In this study, we used a custom SNP set to identify introgressed chromosomal regions in a set of high-yielding Japanese rice cultivars, and we performed an association study to identify genome regions associated with yield.

RESULTS: An informative set of 1152 SNPs was established by screening 14 high-yielding or primary ancestral cultivars for 5760 validated SNPs. Analysis of the population structure of high-yielding cultivars showed three genome types: japonica-type, indica-type and a mixture of the two. SNP allele frequencies showed several regions derived predominantly from one of the two parental genome types. Distinct regions skewed for the presence of parental alleles were observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, 11 and 12 (indica) and on chromosomes 1, 2 and 6 (japonica). A possible relationship between these introgressed regions and six yield traits (blast susceptibility, heading date, length of unhusked seeds, number of panicles, surface area of unhusked seeds and 1000-grain weight) was detected in eight genome regions dominated by alleles of one parental origin. Two of these regions were near Ghd7, a heading date locus, and Pi-ta, a blast resistance locus. The allele types (i.e., japonica or indica) of significant SNPs coincided with those previously reported for candidate genes Ghd7 and Pi-ta.

CONCLUSIONS: Introgression breeding is an established strategy for the accumulation of QTLs and genes controlling high yield. Our custom SNP set is an effective tool for the identification of introgressed genome regions from a particular genetic background. This study demonstrates that changes in genome structure occurred during artificial selection for high yield, and provides information on several genomic regions associated with yield performance.
24877598	Biodegradation of toxic chemicals by Pleurotus eryngii in submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation.	2016	J Microbiol Immunol Infect	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The toxic chemicals bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), nonylphenol (NP), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that have consequently drawn much concern regarding their effect on the environment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the degradation of BPA, BPF, NP, and TBBPA by enzymes from Pleurotus eryngii in submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF), and also to assess the removal of toxic chemicals in spent mushroom compost (SMC).

METHODS: BPA and BPF were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography; NP and TBBPA were analyzed by gas chromatography.

RESULTS: NP degradation was enhanced by adding CuSO4 (1 mM), MnSO4 (0.5 mM), gallic acid (1 mM), tartaric acid (20 mM), citric acid (20 mM), guaiacol (1 mM), or 2,2'-azino-bis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; 1 mM), with the last yielding a higher NP degradation rate than the other additives from SmF. The optimal conditions for enzyme activity from SSF were a sawdust/wheat bran ratio of 1:4 and a moisture content of 5 mL/g. The enzyme activities were higher with sawdust/wheat bran than with sawdust/rice bran. The optimal conditions for the extraction of enzyme from SMC required using sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, solid/solution ratio 1:5), and extraction over 3 hours.

CONCLUSION: The removal rates of toxic chemicals by P. eryngii, in descending order of magnitude, were SSF > SmF > SMC. The removal rates were BPF > BPA > NP > TBBPA.
24856588	Conversion of activated-sludge reactors to microbial fuel cells for wastewater treatment coupled to electricity generation.	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	Wastewater can be treated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with the aid of microbes that oxidize organic compounds using anodes as electron acceptors. Previous studies have suggested the utility of cassette-electrode (CE) MFCs for wastewater treatment, in which rice paddy-field soil was used as the inoculum. The present study attempted to convert an activated-sludge (AS) reactor to CE-MFC and use aerobic sludge in the tank as the source of microbes. We used laboratory-scale (1 L in capacity) reactors that were initially operated in an AS mode to treat synthetic wastewater, containing starch, yeast extract, peptone, plant oil, and detergents. After the organics removal became stable, the aeration was terminated, and CEs were inserted to initiate an MFC-mode operation. It was demonstrated that the MFC-mode operation treated the wastewater at similar efficiencies to those observed in the AS-mode operation with COD-removal efficiencies of 75-80%, maximum power densities of 150-200 mW m(-2) and Coulombic efficiencies of 20-30%. These values were similar to those of CE-MFC inoculated with the soil. Anode microbial communities were analyzed by pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons. Comparative analyses revealed that anode communities enriched from the aerobic sludge were largely different from those from the soil, suggesting that similar reactor performances can be supported by different community structures. The study demonstrates that it is possible to construct wastewater-treatment MFCs by inserting CEs into water-treatment tanks.
25018755	The splicing fate of plant SPO11 genes.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Toward the global understanding of plant meiosis, it seems to be essential to decipher why all as yet sequenced plants need or at least encode for two different meiotic SPO11 genes. This is in contrast to mammals and fungi, where only one SPO11 is present. Both SPO11 in Arabidopsis thaliana are essential for the initiation of double strand breaks (DSBs) during the meiotic prophase. In nearly all eukaryotic organisms DSB induction during prophase I by SPO11 leads to meiotic DSB repair, thereby ensuring the formation of a necessary number of crossovers (CO) as physical connections between the homologous chromosomes. We aim to investigate the specific functions and evolution of both SPO11 genes in land plants. Therefore, we identified and cloned the respective orthologous genes from Brassica rapa, Carica papaya, Oryza sativa, and Physcomitrella patens. In parallel we determined the full length cDNA sequences of SPO11-1 and -2 from all of these plants by RT-PCR. During these experiments we observed that the analyzed plants exhibit a pattern of alternative splicing products of both SPO11 mRNAs. Such an aberrant splicing has previously been described for Arabidopsis and therefore seems to be conserved throughout evolution. Most of the splicing forms of SPO11-1 and -2 seem to be non-functional as they either showed intron retention (IR) or shortened exons. However, the positional distribution and number of alternative splicing events vary strongly between the different plants. The cDNAs showed in most cases premature termination codons (PTCs) due to frameshift. Nevertheless, in some cases we found alternatively spliced but functional cDNAs. These findings let us suggest that alternative splicing of SPO11 depends on the respective gene sequence and on the plant species. Therefore, this conserved mechanism might play a role concerning regulation of SPO11.
24886329	The large-scale investigation of gene expression in Leymus chinensis stigmas provides a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of poaceae self-incompatibility.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Many Poaceae species show a gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system, which is controlled by at least two independent and multiallelic loci, S and Z. Until currently, the gene products for S and Z were unknown. Grass SI plant stigmas discriminate between pollen grains that land on its surface and support compatible pollen tube growth and penetration into the stigma, whereas recognizing incompatible pollen and thus inhibiting pollination behaviors. Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. (sheepgrass) is a Poaceae SI species. A comprehensive analysis of sheepgrass stigma transcriptome may provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of pollen-stigma interactions and grass SI.

RESULTS: The transcript abundance profiles of mature stigmas, mature ovaries and leaves were examined using high-throughput next generation sequencing technology. A comparative transcriptomic analysis of these tissues identified 1,025 specifically or preferentially expressed genes in sheepgrass stigmas. These genes contained a significant proportion of genes predicted to function in cell-cell communication and signal transduction. We identified 111 putative transcription factors (TFs) genes and the most abundant groups were MYB, C2H2, C3H, FAR1, MADS. Comparative analysis of the sheepgrass, rice and Arabidopsis stigma-specific or preferential datasets showed broad similarities and some differences in the proportion of genes in the Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories. Potential SI candidate genes identified in other grasses were also detected in the sheepgrass stigma-specific or preferential dataset. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments validated the expression pattern of stigma preferential genes including homologous grass SI candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first large-scale investigation of gene expression in the stigmas of an SI grass species. We uncovered many notable genes that are potentially involved in pollen-stigma interactions and SI mechanisms, including genes encoding receptor-like protein kinases (RLK), CBL (calcineurin B-like proteins) interacting protein kinases, calcium-dependent protein kinase, expansins, pectinesterase, peroxidases and various transcription factors. The availability of a pool of stigma-specific or preferential genes for L. chinensis offers an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms of SI in Poaceae.
24860584	Cloning of quantitative trait genes from rice reveals conservation and divergence of photoperiod flowering pathways in Arabidopsis and rice.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is determined primarily by daylength (photoperiod), and natural variation in flowering time is due to quantitative trait loci involved in photoperiodic flowering. To date, genetic analysis of natural variants in rice flowering time has resulted in the positional cloning of at least 12 quantitative trait genes (QTGs), including our recently cloned QTGs, Hd17, and Hd16. The QTGs have been assigned to specific photoperiodic flowering pathways. Among them, 9 have homologs in the Arabidopsis genome, whereas it was evident that there are differences in the pathways between rice and Arabidopsis, such that the rice Ghd7-Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway modulated by Hd16 is not present in Arabidopsis. In this review, we describe QTGs underlying natural variation in rice flowering time. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the variation in adaptive divergence and its importance in rice breeding.
24796672	ω-Hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress in non-small cell lung cancer cells.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	ω-Hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid (ω-HUA), a hydroxyl unsaturated fatty acid derivative, is involved in the antifungal activity of wild rice (Oryza officinalis). Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of ω-HUA on a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. ω-HUA increased apoptosis and induced cleavages of caspase-6, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). ω-HUA treatment significantly induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Suppression of CHOP expression and inhibiting ER stress by 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) significantly attenuated the ω-HUA treatment-induced activation of caspase-6, caspase-9, and PARP, and subsequent apoptotic cell death, indicating a role for ER stress in ω-HUA-induced apoptosis. In addition, cells subjected to ω-HUA exhibited significantly increased quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibited ω-HUA-induced apoptotic cell death and ER stress signals, indicating a role for ROS in ER stress-mediated apoptosis in ω-HUA-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that sequential ROS generation and ER stress activation are critical in ω-HUA treatment-induced apoptosis and that ω-HUA represents a promising candidate for NSCLC treatment.
24784760	Overexpression of a Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase Confers Salt and Drought Tolerance in Rice by Preventing Membrane Lipid Peroxidation.	2014	Plant Physiol	The OsCPK4 gene is a member of the complex gene family of calcium-dependent protein kinases in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we report that OsCPK4 expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid. Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK4 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK4 in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress. Knockdown rice plants, however, are severely impaired in growth and development. Compared with control plants, OsCPK4 overexpressor plants exhibit stronger water-holding capability and reduced levels of membrane lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage under drought or salt stress conditions. Also, salt-treated OsCPK4 seedlings accumulate less Na+ in their roots. We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 and found that overexpression of OsCPK4 has a low impact on the rice transcriptome. Moreover, no genes were found to be commonly regulated by OsCPK4 in roots and leaves of rice plants. A significant number of genes involved in lipid metabolism and protection against oxidative stress appear to be up-regulated by OsCPK4 in roots of overexpressor plants. Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i.e. ORYZA SATIVA DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN1 and ORYZA SATIVA No Apical Meristem, Arabidopsis Transcription Activation Factor1-2, Cup-Shaped Cotyledon6 genes) and LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT genes in their roots. Taken together, our data show that OsCPK4 functions as a positive regulator of the salt and drought stress responses in rice via the protection of cellular membranes from stress-induced oxidative damage.
25036967	Heterologous production, purification, and immunodetection of Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence protein AVR-Pia.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The avirulence gene AVR-Pia of Magnaporthe oryzae, which induces a hypersensitive reaction in rice cultivars containing the resistance gene Pia, was expressed in Escherichia coli. AVR-Pia protein was collected as inclusion bodies, denatured, and refolded. Finally, recombinant AVR-Pia (rAVR-Pia) protein was purified by column chromatography. Infiltration of rAVR-Pia triggered cell browning in the leaves of rice cultivar Aichiasahi (Pia), with accumulation of H2O2 and induction of PR1a expression in rice. On the other hand, these reactions were not observed in Shin-2 (pia) leaves after the same treatment. This observation indicated that rAVR-Pia had the function of an avirulence protein. rAVR-Pia was used for immunization of a rabbit, and anti-AVR-Pia antiserum was prepared. The specificity of this antibody was appraised by detecting native AVR-Pia in the inoculated leaf sheath extract using Western blotting in combination with immunoprecipitation. Native AVR-Pia was successfully detected, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 7.4 kDa, indicating signal peptide cleavage. Additionally, secreted native AVR-Pia was quantified as 3.7 ng/g rice sheath.
24291688	Aquaglyceroporins: generalized metalloid channels.	2014	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: Aquaporins (AQPs), members of a superfamily of transmembrane channel proteins, are ubiquitous in all domains of life. They fall into a number of branches that can be functionally categorized into two major sub-groups: i) orthodox aquaporins, which are water-specific channels, and ii) aquaglyceroporins, which allow the transport of water, non-polar solutes, such as urea or glycerol, the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, and gases such as ammonia, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide and, as described in this review, metalloids.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the key findings that AQP channels conduct bidirectional movement of metalloids into and out of cells.

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 behave as inorganic molecular mimics of glycerol, a property that allows their passage through AQP channels. Plant AQPs also allow the passage of boron and silicon as their hydroxyacids, boric acid (B(OH)3) and orthosilicic acid (Si(OH)4), respectively. Genetic analysis suggests that germanic acid (GeO2) is also a substrate. While As(III), Sb(III) and Ge(IV) are toxic metalloids, borate (B(III)) and silicate (Si(IV)) are essential elements in higher plants.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The uptake of environmental metalloids by aquaporins provides an understanding of (i) how toxic elements such as arsenic enter the food chain; (ii) the delivery of arsenic and antimony containing drugs in the treatment of certain forms of leukemia and chemotherapy of diseases caused by pathogenic protozoa; and (iii) the possibility that food plants such as rice could be made safer by genetically modifying them to exclude arsenic while still accumulating boron and silicon. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Aquaporins.
25129932	[Adaptability analysis of FAO Penman-Monteith model over typical underlying surfaces in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China].	2014	Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao	It is very important for studying surface energy and water balance to improve the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. Based on eddy covariance measurements and microclimate observational data available, comparisons were done in accuracy of simulating ET with the FAO Penman-Monteith model from the marshland, rice paddy and soybean field in the Sanjiang Plain. The results showed that the values of ET simulated with the model over marshland was significantly higher than the measured one (averagely 81.8% higher) when the crop coefficients recommend by FAO were adopted, and its modeling efficiency was negative, which indicated that the ET from the marshland couldn' t be simulated by the model. While the seasonal variation of ET over rice paddy and soybean field could be simulated by the model and the accuracy in simulating ET from rice paddy was better than that from soybean field. Crop coefficients (Kc) of marshland, rice paddy and soybean field were all significantly positively related to leaf area index, and crop coefficient of soybean field was also significantly negatively related to vapor pressure deficit. With Kc modified through linear regression, the FAO Penman-Monteith model markedly improved the estimation accuracy for marshland, rice paddy and soybean field, with the mean bias error ranging from -0.1 to 0.3 mm x d(-1), root mean square error ranging from 0.50 to 0.67 mm x d(-1) and modeling efficiency ranging from 0.69 to 0.85. Still, the accuracy in simulating ET from rice paddy was superior to that from the other two underlying surfaces. The FAO Penman-Monteith model was suitable to simulate the ET from rice paddy whether the crop coefficient was modified or not. However, the crop coefficient must be modified if the model was used to simulate the ET from marshland and soybean field.
24878425	Pollen developmental defects in ZD-CMS rice line explored by cytological, molecular and proteomic approaches.	2014	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a widely observed phenomenon, which is especially useful in hybrid seed production. Meixiang A (MxA) is a new rice CMS line derived from a pollen-free sterile line named Yunnan ZidaoA (ZD-CMS). In this study, a homologous WA352 gene with variation in two nucleotides was identified in MxA. Cytological analysis revealed that MxA was aborted in the early uninucleate stage. The protein expression profiles of MxA and its maintainer line MeixiangB (MxB) were systematically compared using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics technology using young florets at the early uninucleate stage. A total of 688 proteins were quantified in both rice lines, and 45 of these proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Bioinformatics analysis indicated a large number of the proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism or the stress response were downregulated in MxA, suggesting that these metabolic processes had been hindered during pollen development in MxA. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) level was increased in the mitochondrion of MxA, and further ultrastructural analysis showed the mitochondria with disrupted cristae in the rice CMS line MxA. These findings substantially contribute to our knowledge of pollen developmental defects in ZD-CMS rice line.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MeixiangA (MxA) is a new type of rice CMS line, which is derived from pollen-free sterile line Yunnan ZidaoA. In this study, the cytological, molecular and proteomic approaches were used to study the characteristics of this new CMS line. Cytological study indicates the CMS line is aborted at the early uninucleate stage. A potential sterile gene ZD352 is identified in MxA, the protein product of which is mainly accumulated at the MMC/Meiotic stage. iTRAQ based proteomic analysis is performed to study the relevant proteins involved in the CMS occurance, 45 proteins are found to be significant differentially expressed and these proteins are involved in many cellular processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, stress response, protein synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report using the iTRAQ-labeled quantitative proteomic to study the protein expression variation during the abortion processes between a CMS line and its maintainer line. These results provide new insights on the CMS mechanisms of ZD-CMS rice line.
25055647	[Emission factors and PM chemical composition study of biomass burning in the Yangtze River Delta region].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The emission characteristics of five typical crops, including wheat straw, rice straw, oil rape straw, soybean straw and fuel wood, were investigated to explore the gas and particulates emission of typical biomass burning in Yangzi-River-Delta area. The straws were tested both by burning in stove and by burning in the farm with a self-developed measurement system as open burning sources. Both gas and fine particle pollutants were measured in this study as well as the chemical composition of fine particles. The results showed that the average emission factors of CO, NO, and PM2,5 in open farm burning were 28.7 g.kg -1, 1.2 g.kg-1 and 2.65 g kg-1 , respectively. Due to insufficient burning in the low oxygen level environment, the emission factors of stove burning were higher than those of open farm burning, which were 81.9 g kg-1, 2. 1 g.kg -1 and 8.5 gkg -1 , respectively. Oil rape straw had the highest emission factors in all tested straws samples. Carbonaceous matter, including organic carbon(OC) and element carbon(EC) , was the foremost component of PM2, 5from biomass burning. The average mass fractions of OC and EC were (38.92 +/- 13.93)% and (5.66 +/-1.54)% by open farm burning and (26.37 +/- 10. 14)% and (18.97 +/- 10.76)% by stove burning. Water soluble ions such as Cl-and K+ had a large contribution. The average mass fractions of CI- and K+ were (13.27 +/-6. 82)% and (12.41 +/- 3.02)% by open farm burning, and were (16.25 +/- 9.34)% and (13.62 +/- 7.91)% by stove burning. The K +/OC values of particles from wheat straw, rice straw, oil rape straw and soybean straw by open farm burning were 0. 30, 0. 52, 0. 49 and 0. 15, respectively, which can be used to evaluate the influence on the regional air quality in YRD area from biomass burning and provide direct evidence for source apportionment.
24899903	Contaminated pond water favors cholera outbreak at haibatpur village, purba medinipur district, west bengal, India.	2014	J Trop Med	Health workers reported an increased number of diarrhea cases at Haibatpur village on June 17, 2012. This outbreak was investigated with the following objectives: to confirm the existence of diarrhea outbreak, to find out the risk factors, and propose control measures. Cases were listed; spot map and epidemic curve were drawn. Attack rate was calculated by age and sex and risk factors were found out by calculating odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Rectal swabs were taken and water specimens were collected for laboratory test. Forty-one cases of patients were identified with overall attack rate (AR) was 5% (41/780). AR among men was higher 6% (25/404) than women. There was no death. V. cholerae 01 Eltor Ogawa was isolated from one (1/4) stool specimen. Spot map showed cases clustered around two ponds which were contaminated with coliform organisms. The underground water was a bit saline in nature. Using pond water for preparation of fermented rice (Panta Bhat) (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.69-13.51), washing utensil in pond water (OR 7.31, 95% CI 1.77-42.29) were associated with cholera outbreak. Health education was done to villagers. Disinfection of two ponds with bleaching powder was done. We proposed supplying of safe drinking water and repairing defective deep tube well to village.
24886295	Quantitative trait loci identification, fine mapping and gene expression profiling for ovicidal response to whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera Horvath) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The whitebacked planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera Horváth, is a serious rice pest in Asia. Ovicidal resistance is a natural rice defense mechanism against WBPH and is characterized by the formation of watery lesions (WLs) and increased egg mortality (EM) at the WBPH oviposition sites.

RESULTS: This study aimed to understand the genetic and molecular basis of rice ovicidal resistance to WBPH by combining genetic and genomic analyses. First, the ovicidal trait in doubled haploid rice lines derived from a WBPH-resistant cultivar (CJ06) and a WBPH-susceptible cultivar (TN1) were phenotyped based on the necrotic symptoms of the leaf sheaths and EM. Using a constructed molecular linkage map, 19 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with WLs and EM were identified on eight chromosomes. Of them, qWL6 was determined to be a major QTL for WL. Based on chromosome segment substitution lines and a residual heterozygous population, a high-resolution linkage analysis further defined the qWL6 locus to a 122-kb region on chromosome 6, which was annotated to encode 20 candidate genes. We then conducted an Affymetrix microarray analysis to determine the transcript abundance in the CJ06 and TN1 plants. Upon WBPH infestation, 432 genes in CJ06 and 257 genes in TN1 were significantly up-regulated, while 802 genes in CJ06 and 398 genes in TN1 were significantly down-regulated. This suggests that remarkable global changes in gene expression contribute to the ovicidal resistance of rice. Notably, four genes in the 122-kb region of the qWL6 locus were differentially regulated between CJ06 and TN1 in response to the WBPH infestation, suggesting they may be candidate resistance genes.

CONCLUSIONS: The information obtained from the fine mapping of qWL6 and the microarray analyses will facilitate the isolation of this important resistance gene and its use in breeding WBPH-resistant rice.
24919709	Interaction specificity and coexpression of rice NPR1 homologs 1 and 3 (NH1 and NH3), TGA transcription factors and Negative Regulator of Resistance (NRR) proteins.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1, NPR1 (also known as NIM1 and SAI1), is a key regulator of SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis. In rice, the NPR1 homolog 1 (NH1) interacts with TGA transcriptional regulators and the Negative Regulator of Resistance (NRR) protein to modulate the SAR response. Though five NPR1 homologs (NHs) have been identified in rice, only NH1 and NH3 enhance immunity when overexpressed. To understand why NH1 and NH3, but not NH2, NH4, or NH5, contribute to the rice immune response, we screened TGA transcription factors and NRR-like proteins for interactions specific to NH1 and NH3. We also examined their co-expression patterns using publicly available microarray data.

RESULTS: We tested five NHs, four NRR homologs (RHs), and 13 rice TGA proteins for pair-wise protein interactions using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and split YFP assays. A survey of 331 inter-family interactions revealed a broad, complex protein interaction network. To investigate preferred interaction partners when all three families of proteins were present, we performed a bridged split YFP assay employing YFPN-fused TGA, YFPC-fused RH, and NH proteins without YFP fusions. We found 64 tertiary interactions mediated by NH family members among the 120 sets we examined. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, each NH protein was capable of interacting with most TGA and RH proteins. In the split YFP assay, NH1 was the most prevalent interactor of TGA and RH proteins, NH3 ranked the second, and NH4 ranked the third. Based on their interaction with TGA proteins, NH proteins can be divided into two subfamilies: NH1, NH2, and NH3 in one family and NH4 and NH5 in the other.In addition to evidence of overlap in interaction partners, co-expression analyses of microarray data suggest a correlation between NH1 and NH3 expression patterns, supporting their common role in rice immunity. However, NH3 is very tightly co-expressed with RH1 and RH2, while NH1 is strongly, inversely co-expressed with RH proteins, representing a difference between NH1 and NH3 expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide surveys reveal that each rice NH protein can partner with many rice TGA and RH proteins and that each NH protein prefers specific interaction partners. NH1 and NH3 are capable of interacting strongly with most rice TGA and RH proteins, whereas NH2, NH4, and NH5 have weaker, limited interaction with TGA and RH proteins in rice cells. We have identified rTGA2.1, rTGA2.2, rTGA2.3, rLG2, TGAL2 and TGAL4 proteins as the preferred partners of NH1 and NH3, but not NH2, NH4, or NH5. These TGA proteins may play an important role in NH1- and NH3-mediated immune responses. In contrast, NH4 and NH5 preferentially interact with TGAL5, TGAL7, TGAL8 and TGAL9, which are predicted to be involved in plant development.
25071407	An effective homologous cloning method for isolating novel miR172s from Phalaenopsis hybrida.	2014	Genet Mol Biol	MiR172 is an important microRNA that regulates floral development in various plants and downregulates AP2 family members to relieve the stress on floral determinacy, leading to phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In this work, PCR with primers designed based on the rice miR172 sequence was used to isolate two miR172-like transcripts from Phalaenopsis hybrida (PhmiR172-1 and PhmiR172-2) that were very similar to Oryza miR172d and Arabidopsis miR172b. RT-PCR indicated that the levels of these two transcripts were negatively correlated with the level of the Phalaenopsis AP2 (PhAP2) gene in stem, root, pedicel and sepal, and that both were co-expressed with PhAP2 in young buds. Overproduction of PhmiR172-2 in Arabidopsis led to early flowering. The homologous cloning method used to isolate the Phalaenopsis miR172-like transcripts can be used to isolate miRNAs from other species. These PhmiR172 transcripts may be used to accelerate the flowering of orchids.
24917171	Albino midrib 1, encoding a putative potassium efflux antiporter, affects chloroplast development and drought tolerance in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Mutation of the AM1 gene causes an albino midrib phenotype and enhances tolerance to drought in rice K(+) efflux antiporter (KEA) genes encode putative potassium efflux antiporters that are mainly located in plastid-containing organisms, ranging from lower green algae to higher flowering plants. However, little genetic evidence has been provided on the functions of KEA in chloroplast development. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant, albino midrib 1 (am1), with green- and white-variegation in the first few leaves, and albino midrib phenotype in older tissues. We found that AM1 encoded a putative KEA in chloroplast. AM1 was highly expressed in leaves, while lowly in roots. Chloroplast gene expression and proteins accumulation were affected during chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in am1 mutants. Interestingly, AM1 was induced by salt and PEG, and am1 showed enhanced sensitivity to salinity in seed germination and increased tolerance to drought. Taken together, we concluded that KEAs were involved in chloroplast development and played important roles in drought tolerance.
25197449	High-quality draft genome sequence of nematocidal Bacillus thuringiensis Sbt003.	2014	Stand Genomic Sci	Bacillus thuringiensis represents one of the six species of "Bacillus cereus group" in the genus Bacillus within the family Bacillaceae. Strain Sbt003 was isolated from soil and identified as B. thuringiensis. It harbors at least seven plasmids and produces three shapes of parasporal crystals including oval, bipyramidal and rice. SDS-PAGE analysis of spore-crystal suspension of this strain reveals six major protein bands, which implies the presence of multiple parasporal crystal genes. Bioassay of this strain reveals that it shows specific activity against nematodes and human cancer cells. In this study, we report the whole genomic shotgun sequences of Sbt003. The high-quality draft of the genome is 6,175,670 bp long (including chromosome and plasmids) with 6,372 protein-coding and 80 RNA genes.
24951312	Elevated CO2 decreases the Photorespiratory NH3 production but does not decrease the NH3 compensation point in rice leaves.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	The exchange of gaseous NH3 between the atmosphere and plants plays a pivotal role in controlling the global NH3 cycle. Photorespiration generates NH3 through oxygenation instead of carboxylation by the CO2-fixing enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The future increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, [CO2], is expected to reduce plant NH3 production by suppressing RuBisCO oxygenation (Vo). We measured the net leaf NH3 uptake rate (FNH3) across NH3 concentrations in the air (na) ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 nmol mol(-1) at three [CO2] values (190, 360 and 750 µmol mol(-1)) using rice plants. We analyzed leaf NH3 gas exchange using a custom-made whole-leaf chamber system, and determined the NH3 compensation point (γ), a measure of potential NH3 emission, as the x-intercept of the linear relationship of FNH3 as a function of na. Our γ values were lower than those reported for other plant species. γ did not decrease under elevated [CO2], although leaf NH4 (+) content decreased with decreasing Vo at higher [CO2]. This was also the case for γ estimated from the pH and NH4 (+) concentration of the leaf apoplast solution (γ'). γ' of rice plants, grown at elevated [CO2] for months in a free-air CO2 enrichment facility, was also not decreased by elevated [CO2]. These results suggest that suppression of RuBisCO oxygenation by elevated [CO2] does not decrease potential leaf NH3 emission in rice plants.
24939035	Occurrence of phosphorylated castasterone in Arabidopsis thaliana and Lycopersicum esculentum.	2015	Physiol Plant	An in vitro enzyme assay using radioisotope-labeled (3) H-castasterone ((3) H-CS) or (32) P-ATP showed that CS can be phosphorylated by ATP in Arabidopsis and tomato plants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis using non-isotope-labeled CS and ATP revealed that the phosphorylation of CS occurs at the side chain, most likely at the C-23 hydroxyl. The polar fractions than free brassinosteroids (BRs) obtained from extracts of Arabidopsis and tomato showed almost no BRs activity in a rice lamina inclination bioassay. However, the fractions showed increased bioactivity after treatment with wheat germ acidic phosphatase (WGAP). Additionally, CS was identified from the hydrolysate by WGAP using GC-MS analysis in both plants. In contrast, the polar fractions obtained from BR-deficient mutants, Arabidopsis cyp85a2 and tomato d(x) , did not show an increase in biological activity with WGAP treatment, and no free BRs, including CS, were detected in the hydrolysate. This suggests that CS phosphate is a naturally occurring biologically inactive conjugate that is generated when CS is normally synthesized in Arabidopsis and tomato plants. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of CS is an important conjugation process for the maintenance of the homeostatic level of an active BR and thus the regulation of the growth and development of plants.
24991566	Exogenous proline and glycine betaine mediated upregulation of antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems provides better protection against salt-induced oxidative stress in two rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties.	2014	Biomed Res Int	The present study investigates the roles of exogenous proline (Pro, 5 mM) and glycine betaine (GB, 5 mM) in improving salt stress tolerance in salt sensitive (BRRI dhan49) and salt tolerant (BRRI dhan54) rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties. Salt stresses (150 and 300 mM NaCl for 48 h) significantly reduced leaf relative water (RWC) and chlorophyll (chl) content and increased endogenous Pro and increased lipid peroxidation and H2O2 levels. Ascorbate (AsA), glutathione (GSH) and GSH/GSSG, ascorbate peroxidae (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and glyoxalase I (Gly I) activities were reduced in sensitive variety and these were increased in tolerant variety due to salt stress. The glyoxalase II (Gly II), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were increased in both cultivars by salt stress. Exogenous Pro and GB application with salt stress improved physiological parameters and reduced oxidative damage in both cultivars where BRRI dhan54 showed better tolerance. The result suggests that exogenous application of Pro and GB increased rice seedlings' tolerance to salt-induced oxidative damage by upregulating their antioxidant defense system where these protectants rendered better performance to BRRI dhan54 and Pro can be considered as better protectant than GB.
25014263	Genome-wide expression analysis of rice ABC transporter family across spatio-temporal samples and in response to abiotic stresses.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Although the super family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins plays key roles in the physiology and development of plants, the functions of members of this interesting family mostly remain to be clarified, especially in crop plants. Thus, systematic analysis of this family in rice (Oryza sativa), a major model crop plant, will be helpful in the design of effective strategies for functional analysis. Phylogenomic analysis that integrates anatomy and stress meta-profiling data based on a large collection of rice Affymetrix array data into the phylogenic context provides useful clues into the functions for each of the ABC transporter family members in rice. Using anatomy data, we identified 17 root-preferred and 16-shoot preferred genes at the vegetative stage, and 3 pollen, 2 embryo, 2 ovary, 2 endosperm, and 1 anther-preferred gene at the reproductive stage. The stress data revealed significant up-regulation or down-regulation of 47 genes under heavy metal treatment, 16 genes under nutrient deficient conditions, and 51 genes under abiotic stress conditions. Of these, we confirmed the differential expression patterns of 14 genes in root samples exposed to drought stress using quantitative real-time PCR. Network analysis using RiceNet suggests a functional gene network involving nine rice ABC transporters that are differentially regulated by drought stress in root, further enhancing the prediction of biological function. Our analysis provides a molecular basis for the study of diverse biological phenomena mediated by the ABC family in rice and will contribute to the enhancement of crop yield and stress tolerance.
24965356	OsiSAP1 overexpression improves water-deficit stress tolerance in transgenic rice by affecting expression of endogenous stress-related genes.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsiSAP1, an A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, confers water-deficit stress tolerance at different stages of growth by affecting expression of several endogenous genes in transgenic rice. Transgenic lines have been generated from rice constitutively expressing OsiSAP1, an A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress-associated protein gene from rice, driven by maize UBIQUITIN gene promoter and evaluated for water-deficit stress tolerance at different stages of growth. Their seeds show early germination and seedlings grow better under water-deficit stress compared to non-transgenic (NT) rice. Leaves from transgenic seedlings showed lesser membrane damage and lipid peroxidation under water-deficit stress. Relatively lower rate of leaf water loss has been observed in detached intact leaves from transgenic plants during late vegetative stage. Delayed leaf rolling and higher relative water content were also observed in transgenic plants under progressive water-deficit stress during reproductive developmental stage. Although reduction in grain yield is observed under unstressed condition, the relative water-deficit stress-induced yield losses are lower in transgenic rice vis-à-vis NT plants thereby resulting in yield loss protection. Transcriptome analysis suggests that overexpression of OsiSAP1 in transgenic rice results in altered expression of several endogenous genes including those coding for transcription factors, membrane transporters, signaling components and genes involved in metabolism, growth and development. A total of 150 genes were found to be more than twofold up-regulated in transgenic rice of which 43 genes are known to be involved in stress response. Our results suggest that OsiSAP1 is a positive regulator of water-deficit stress tolerance in rice.
24944111	Characterization of a lily anther-specific gene encoding cytoskeleton-binding glycoproteins and overexpression of the gene causes severe inhibition of pollen tube growth.	2014	Planta	This work characterizes an anther/pollen-specific gene that encodes potential intermediate filament (IF)-binding glycoproteins in lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb. cv. Snow Queen) anthers during the development and pollen germination. LLP13 is a single gene that encodes a polypeptide of 807 amino acids, and a calculated molecular mass of 91 kDa. The protein contains a predicted transmembrane domain at the N-terminus and a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF)593 at the C-terminal half of the polypeptide. Sequence analysis revealed that LLP13 shares significant identity (37-41 %) with two intermediate filament antigen-binding proteins, representing a unique subgroup of DUF593 domain proteins from known rice and Arabidopsis species. The expression of LLP13 gene is anther-specific, and the transcript accumulates only at the stage of pollen maturation. Both premature drying and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment of developing pollen indicated that LLP13 was not induced by desiccation and ABA, but by other developmental cues. Antiserum was raised against the overexpressed LLP13C fragment of the protein in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified antibodies were prepared. Immunoblot analyses revealed that the LLP13 protein was a heterogeneous, anther-specific glycoprotein that accumulated only at the stage of pollen maturation. The protein is not heat-soluble. The level of LLP13 protein remained for 24 h during germination in vitro. Overexpression of LLP13-GFP or GFP-LLP13 in lily pollen tubes caused severe inhibition of tube elongation. The LLP13 protein codistributed with mTalin in growing tubes, suggesting that it apparently decorates actin cytoskeleton and is likely a cytoskeleton-binding protein that binds with IFs that potentially exist in pollen tubes.
24987305	Genetic variation in resistance to blast disease (Pyricularia oryzae Cavara) in Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L.), as determined using a differential system.	2014	Breed Sci	A total of 324 Japanese rice accessions, including landrace, improved, and weedy types were used to 1) investigate genetic variations in blast resistance to standard differential isolates, and 2) across the genome using polymorphism data on 64 SSR markers. From the polymorphism data, the accessions were classified into two clusters,. Accessions from irrigated lowland areas were included mainly in cluster I, and upland and Indica types were mainly in cluster II. The accessions were classified into three resistance subgroups, A2, B1 and B2, based on the reaction patterns to blast isolates. The accessions in A2 were postulated to have at least two resistance genes Pish and Pik-s, whereas those in B1 had various combinations of the resistance genes Pish, Pia, Pii, Pi3, Pi5(t), and Pik alleles. The B2 accessions were resistant to almost all isolates, and many accessions of cluster II were included, and had Pish, Pia, Pii, Pi3, Pi5(t), certain Pik, Piz and Pita alleles, and unknown genes. The frequencies of accessions of B1 originating in Hokkaido, and those of B2 originating in the Kanto and Tohoku regions were remarkably higher than in the other regions.
24966130	Transcriptional silencing of heterologous anther promoters in maize: a genetic method to replace detasseling for seed production.	2014	Plant Reprod	The promoter of the maize male fertility gene ZmMs45, and other anther-specific maize promoters, was previously shown to be transcriptionally silenced by constitutively expressed promoter-inverted repeat RNAs (pIRs). In addition, ZmMS45pIR-mediated male sterility was reversed by co-expression of Ms45 transcribed by promoters not targeted by pIR RNA silencing. In this report, male fertility was restored to ms45 maize by fusing non-maize inflorescence promoters to the ZmMS45 coding region. This complementation assay also established that these rice or Arabidopsis promoters, when expressed as pIRs, functioned to silence sequence identical promoters. These observations were exploited to develop a genetic method to replace maize detasseling during hybrid seed production. In this system, the ZmMS45 coding region was fused to one of two dissimilar non-maize promoters to generate paired sets of ms45 recessive inbred parents which could be self-pollinated and maintained independently. Linked to each unique Ms45 gene was a non-maize pIR which targeted the promoter transcribing the Ms45 copy contained in the paired inbred parent plant. A cross of these pairs brings the dissimilar pIR cassettes together and resulted in silencing both transformed copies of Ms45. The net result uncovers the ms45 allele carried by the inbreds yielding male sterile progeny. The application of heterologous promoters and transcriptional silencing in plants provides an alternative to post-transcriptional gene silencing as a means to restore and silence gene function in plants.
24976603	Photosynthetic changes of flag leaves during senescence stage in super high-yield hybrid rice LYPJ grown in field condition.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Photosynthetic activities and thylakoid membrane protein patterns as well as the ultrastructure of chloroplasts in flag leaves were investigated during the senescence processes in high-yield hybrid rice LYPJ under field condition. The earlier decrease of PS I activity than PS II in LYPJ was primarily due to the significant degradation of PS I chlorophyll-protein complex. The degradation rate for each chlorophyll-protein complex was different and the order for the stability of thylakoid membrane complexes during flag leaf senescence in rice LYPJ was: LHCII > OEC > PSII core antenna > PSII core > PSI core > LHCI, which was partly supported by the BN-PAGE gel combined with immunoblot analysis. A decrease in the chlorophyll a/b ratio at the senescence stage was observed to coincide with stability of the LHCII subunits. Ultrastructural investigations revealed that the chloroplasts have large loosen stacking grana without interconnecting stroma thylakoids during the senescence processes. It was hypothesized that the stability of grana thylakoids harboring the major LHCII under high radiation condition in summer might played a key role in the dissipation of excess light energy. This alternative strategy would protect photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage and might be causally related to the high yield of this rice cultivar.
24893047	Tissue-specific transcriptional profiling of iron-deficient and cadmium-stressed rice using laser capture microdissection.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Several metals are essential nutrients for plants. However, they become toxic at high levels and deleteriously affect crop yield and quality. We recently reported the spatial gene expression profiles of iron (Fe)-deficient and cadmium (Cd)-stressed rice using laser microdissection and microarray analysis. The roots of Fe-deficient and Cd-stressed rice were separated into the vascular bundle (VB), cortex (Cor), and epidermis plus exodermis (EP). In addition, vascular bundles from new and old leaves at the lowest node, which are important for metal distribution, were analyzed separately (newDC and oldDC, respectively). Genes expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the VB, Cor, EP, newDC, and oldDC formed large clusters. The genes upregulated in all of the VB, Cor, and EP by Fe deficiency formed a substantial cluster that was smaller than the tissue-specific clusters. Significant numbers of genes expressed in newDC or oldDC were also expressed in VB in roots, suggesting that vascular bundles in the lowest nodes and roots have a partially common function. The expression patterns of transporter families involved in metal homeostasis were investigated, and members of each family were either expressed differentially in each tissue or showed different responses to Fe deficiency. One potassium transporter gene, OsHAK22, was upregulated by Fe deficiency in VB, Cor, and EP, suggesting that OsHAK22 is involved in potassium transport associated with mugineic acids secretion.
24890396	Transcript suppression of TaGW2 increased grain width and weight in bread wheat.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple crop in the world. Grain weight is a major factor of grain yield in wheat, and the identification of candidate genes associated with grain weight is very important for high-yield breeding of wheat. TaGW2 is an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2 that negatively regulates the grain width and weight in rice. There are three TaGW2 homoeologs in bread wheat, TaGW2A, TaGW2B, and TaGW2D. In this study, a specific TaGW2-RNA interference (RNAi) cassette was constructed and transformed into a Chinese bread wheat variety 'Shi 4185' with small grain. The transcript levels of TaGW2A, TaGW2B, and TaGW2D were simultaneously downregulated in TaGW2-RNAi transgenic wheat lines. Compared with the controls, TaGW2-underexpressing transgenic lines displayed significantly increases in the grain width and weight, suggesting that TaGW2 negatively regulated the grain width and weight in bread wheat. Further transcript analysis showed that in different bread wheat accessions, the transcript abundance of TaGW2A was negatively associated with the grain width.
24888863	Strigolactone signaling regulates rice leaf senescence in response to a phosphate deficiency.	2014	Planta	Strigolactones (SLs) act as plant hormones that inhibit shoot branching and stimulate secondary growth of the stem, primary root growth, and root hair elongation. In the moss Physcomitrella patens, SLs regulate branching of chloronemata and colony extension. In addition, SL-deficient and SL-insensitive mutants show delayed leaf senescence. To explore the effects of SLs on leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we treated leaf segments of rice dwarf mutants with a synthetic SL analogue, GR24, and evaluated their chlorophyll contents, ion leakage, and expression levels of senescence-associated genes. Exogenously applied GR24 restored normal leaf senescence in SL-deficient mutants, but not in SL-insensitive mutants. Most plants highly produce endogenous SLs in response to phosphate deficiency. Thus, we evaluated effects of GR24 under phosphate deficiency. Chlorophyll levels did not differ of in the wild-type between the sufficient and deficient phosphate conditions, but increased in the SL-deficient mutants under phosphate deficiency, leading in the strong promotion of leaf senescence by GR24 treatment. These results indicate that the mutants exhibited increased responsiveness to GR24 under phosphate deficiency. In addition, GR24 accelerated leaf senescence in the intact SL-deficient mutants under phosphate deficiency as well as dark-induced leaf senescence. The effects of GR24 were stronger in d10 compared to d17. Based on these results, we suggest that SLs regulate leaf senescence in response to phosphate deficiency.
24921928	Early embryogenesis-specific expression of the rice transposon Ping enhances amplification of the MITE mPing.	2014	PLoS Genet	Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are numerically predominant transposable elements in the rice genome, and their activities have influenced the evolution of genes. Very little is known about how MITEs can rapidly amplify to thousands in the genome. The rice MITE mPing is quiescent in most cultivars under natural growth conditions, although it is activated by various stresses, such as tissue culture, gamma-ray irradiation, and high hydrostatic pressure. Exceptionally in the temperate japonica rice strain EG4 (cultivar Gimbozu), mPing has reached over 1000 copies in the genome, and is amplifying owing to its active transposition even under natural growth conditions. Being the only active MITE, mPing in EG4 is an appropriate material to study how MITEs amplify in the genome. Here, we provide important findings regarding the transposition and amplification of mPing in EG4. Transposon display of mPing using various tissues of a single EG4 plant revealed that most de novo mPing insertions arise in embryogenesis during the period from 3 to 5 days after pollination (DAP), and a large majority of these insertions are transmissible to the next generation. Locus-specific PCR showed that mPing excisions and insertions arose at the same time (3 to 5 DAP). Moreover, expression analysis and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Ping, an autonomous partner for mPing, was markedly up-regulated in the 3 DAP embryo of EG4, whereas such up-regulation of Ping was not observed in the mPing-inactive cultivar Nipponbare. These results demonstrate that the early embryogenesis-specific expression of Ping is responsible for the successful amplification of mPing in EG4. This study helps not only to elucidate the whole mechanism of mPing amplification but also to further understand the contribution of MITEs to genome evolution.
24987300	Influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding granule-bound starch synthase I on amylose content in Vietnamese rice cultivars.	2014	Breed Sci	Amylose content is one of the most important factors influencing the physical and chemical properties of starch in rice. Analysis of 352 Vietnamese rice cultivars revealed a wide range of variation in apparent amylose content and the expression level of granule-bound starch synthase. On the basis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at the splicing donor site of the first intron and in the coding region of the granule-bound starch synthase I gene, Waxy gene, alleles can be classified into seven groups that reflect differences in apparent amylose content. The very low and low apparent amylose content levels were tightly associated with a G to T in the first intron whereas intermediate and high amylose was associated with a T genotype at SNP in exon 10. The correlation between the combination of T genotype at SNP in the first intron, C in exon 6, or C in exon 10 was predominant among low amylose rice varieties. Our analysis confirmed the existence of Wx (op) allele in Vietnamese rice germplasm. The results of this study suggest that the low amylose properties of Vietnamese local rice germplasm are attributable to spontaneous mutations at exons, and not at the splicing donor site.
24896089	Function and interaction of the coupled genes responsible for Pik-h encoded rice blast resistance.	2014	PLoS One	Pik-h, an allele of Pik, confers resistance against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Its positional cloning has shown that it comprises a pair of NBS-LRR genes, Pikh-1 and Pikh-2. While Pikh-1 appears to be constitutively transcribed, the transcript abundance of Pikh-2 responds to pathogen challenge. The Pikh-1 CC (coiled coil) domain interacts directly with both AvrPik-h and Pikh-2. Transient expression assays demonstrated that Pikh-2 mediates the initiation of the host defence response. Nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of both Pikh-1 and Pikh-2 is required for their functionalities. In a proposed mechanistic model of Pik-h resistance, it is suggested that Pikh-1 acts as an adaptor between AvrPik-h and Pikh-2, while Pikh-2 transduces the signal to trigger Pik-h-specific resistance.
25381433	Drought adaptation of stay-green sorghum is associated with canopy development, leaf anatomy, root growth, and water uptake.	2014	J Exp Bot	Stay-green sorghum plants exhibit greener leaves and stems during the grain-filling period under water-limited conditions compared with their senescent counterparts, resulting in increased grain yield, grain mass, and lodging resistance. Stay-green has been mapped to a number of key chromosomal regions, including Stg1, Stg2, Stg3, and Stg4, but the functions of these individual quantitative trait loci (QTLs) remain unclear. The objective of this study was to show how positive effects of Stg QTLs on grain yield under drought can be explained as emergent consequences of their effects on temporal and spatial water-use patterns that result from changes in leaf-area dynamics. A set of four Stg near-isogenic lines (NILs) and their recurrent parent were grown in a range of field and semicontrolled experiments in southeast Queensland, Australia. These studies showed that the four Stg QTLs regulate canopy size by: (1) reducing tillering via increased size of lower leaves, (2) constraining the size of the upper leaves; and (3) in some cases, decreasing the number of leaves per culm. In addition, they variously affect leaf anatomy and root growth. The multiple pathways by which Stg QTLs modulate canopy development can result in considerable developmental plasticity. The reduction in canopy size associated with Stg QTLs reduced pre-flowering water demand, thereby increasing water availability during grain filling and, ultimately, grain yield. The generic physiological mechanisms underlying the stay-green trait suggest that similar Stg QTLs could enhance post-anthesis drought adaptation in other major cereals such as maize, wheat, and rice.
24913125	LcWRKY5: an unknown function gene from sheepgrass improves drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The expression of LcWRKY5 was induced significantly by salinity, mannitol and cutting treatments. Arabidopsis- overexpressing LcWRKY5 greatly increased dehydration tolerance by regulating the expression of multiple stress-responsive genes. Based on the data of sheepgrass 454 high-throughout sequencing and expression analysis results, a drought-induced gene LcWRKY5 was isolated and cloned, and the biological role of the gene has not been reported until now. Bioinformatics analysis showed that LcWRKY5 contains one conserved WD domain and belongs to the group II WRKY protein family. LcWRKY5 shows high sequence identity with predicted or putative protein products of Hordeum vulgare, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum aestivum, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, but it has low homology with WRKYs from dicotyledonous plants. Several drought-inducibility, fungal elicitor, MeJA-responsiveness, endosperm, light, anoxic specific inducibility, and circadian control elements were found in the promoter region of LcWRKY5. Tissue-specific expression patterns showed that LcWRKY5 is expressed in roots and leaves, without expression in other tissues. The expression of LcWRKY5 was induced significantly under salinity and mannitol stresses but was not notably changed under cold and Abscisic acid stress. The LcWRKY5 protein exhibits transcription activation activity in the yeast one-hybrid system. Overexpressing LcWRKY5 exhibited increased rates of cotyledon greening and plant survival in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with wild-type plants under drought stress, and the expression levels of DREB2A and RD29A in transgenic plants were enhanced under drought stress. These results indicated that LcWRKY5 may play an important role in drought-response networks through regulation of the DREB2A pathway. LcWRKY5 can be a candidate gene for engineering drought tolerance in other crops.
24980094	Mutation of the RDR1 gene caused genome-wide changes in gene expression, regional variation in small RNA clusters and localized alteration in DNA methylation in rice.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Endogenous small (sm) RNAs (primarily si- and miRNAs) are important trans/cis-acting regulators involved in diverse cellular functions. In plants, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) are essential for smRNA biogenesis. It has been established that RDR2 is involved in the 24 nt siRNA-dependent RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Recent studies have suggested that RDR1 is involved in a second RdDM pathway that relies mostly on 21 nt smRNAs and functions to silence a subset of genomic loci that are usually refractory to the normal RdDM pathway in Arabidopsis. Whether and to what extent the homologs of RDR1 may have similar functions in other plants remained unknown.

RESULTS: We characterized a loss-of-function mutant (Osrdr1) of the OsRDR1 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.) derived from a retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Microarray analysis identified 1,175 differentially expressed genes (5.2% of all expressed genes in the shoot-tip tissue of rice) between Osrdr1 and WT, of which 896 and 279 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in Osrdr1. smRNA sequencing revealed regional alterations in smRNA clusters across the rice genome. Some of the regions with altered smRNA clusters were associated with changes in DNA methylation. In addition, altered expression of several miRNAs was detected in Osrdr1, and at least some of which were associated with altered expression of predicted miRNA target genes. Despite these changes, no phenotypic difference was identified in Osrdr1 relative to WT under normal condition; however, ephemeral phenotypic fluctuations occurred under some abiotic stress conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that OsRDR1 plays a role in regulating a substantial number of endogenous genes with diverse functions in rice through smRNA-mediated pathways involving DNA methylation, and which participates in abiotic stress response.
24947835	OsJAR1 is required for JA-regulated floret opening and anther dehiscence in rice.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Jasmonates are important phytohormones regulating reproductive development. We used two recessive rice Tos17 alleles of OsJAR1, osjar1-2 and osjar1-3, to study the biological function of jasmonates in rice anthesis. The florets of both osjar1 alleles stayed open during anthesis because the lodicules, which control flower opening in rice, were not withering on time. Furthermore, dehiscence of the anthers filled with viable pollen, was impaired, resulting in lower fertility. In situ hybridization and promoter GUS transgenic analysis confirmed OsJAR1 expression in these floral tissues. Flower opening induced by exogenous applied methyl jasmonate was impaired in osjar1 plants and was restored in a complementation experiment with transgenics expressing a wild type copy of OsJAR1 controlled by a rice actin promoter. Biochemical analysis showed that OsJAR1 encoded an enzyme conjugating jasmonic acid (JA) to at least Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp and Val and both osjar1 alleles had substantial reduction in content of JA-Ile, JA-Leu and JA-Val in florets. We conclude that OsJAR1 is a JA-amino acid synthetase that is required for optimal flower opening and closing and anther dehiscence in rice.
24955773	Fine physical and genetic mapping of powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW172 originating from wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides).	2014	PLoS One	Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases in the world. In this study, a single dominant powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW172 was identified in the IW172 wild emmer accession and mapped to the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL (bin7AL-16-0.86-0.90) via molecular marker analysis. MlIW172 was closely linked with the RFLP probe Xpsr680-derived STS marker Xmag2185 and the EST markers BE405531 and BE637476. This suggested that MlIW172 might be allelic to the Pm1 locus or a new locus closely linked to Pm1. By screening genomic BAC library of durum wheat cv. Langdon and 7AL-specific BAC library of hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring, and after analyzing genome scaffolds of Triticum urartu containing the marker sequences, additional markers were developed to construct a fine genetic linkage map on the MlIW172 locus region and to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.48 cM interval. Comparative genetics analyses using ESTs and RFLP probe sequences flanking the MlIW172 region against other grass species revealed a general co-linearity in this region with the orthologous genomic regions of rice chromosome 6, Brachypodium chromosome 1, and sorghum chromosome 10. However, orthologous resistance gene-like RGA sequences were only present in wheat and Brachypodium. The BAC contigs and sequence scaffolds that we have developed provide a framework for the physical mapping and map-based cloning of MlIW172.
24905696	Arsenate induced differential response in rice genotypes.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	To study the differential response in two rice genotypes (PB1 and IR-64), hydroponically grown 14 days old plants were exposed to 50, 150 and 300µM As(V) for 24 and 96h. Accumulation of As was not significantly higher in PB1 variety except at higher concentration (300μM) and duration (96h), but up regulation of gene transcripts were higher as compared to IR-64. Inhibition in seed germination, root-shoot length, chlorophyll and protein content was observed in both varieties with increasing concentration and exposure time. PB1 variety was found more capable to detoxify As(V) through induction of antioxidant defense system and other stress related parameters (cysteine, proline content). SDS-PAGE and semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed significant changes in protein profile and gene expression analysis. The results suggests that various studied parameters and transcripts accumulation showed a combinatorial type of tolerance mechanism in PB1 variety to provide better protection against As(V) stress.
25076836	Meta-analysis of quantitative trait loci for grain yield and component traits under reproductive-stage drought stress in an upland rice population.	2014	Mol Breed	A recombinant inbred population developed from a cross between high-yielding lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) subspecies indica cv. IR64 and upland tropical rice subspecies japonica cv. Cabacu was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain yield (GY) and component traits under reproductive-stage drought stress. One hundred fifty-four lines were grown in field trials in Indonesia under aerobic conditions by giving surface irrigation to field capacity every 4 days. Water stress was imposed for a period of 15 days during pre-flowering by withholding irrigation at 65 days after seeding. Leaf rolling was scored at the end of the stress period and eight agronomic traits were evaluated after recovery. The population was also evaluated for root pulling force, and a total of 201 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were used to construct the molecular genetic linkage map and QTL mapping. A QTL for GY under drought stress was identified in a region close to the sd1 locus on chromosome 1. QTL meta-analysis across diverse populations showed that this QTL was conserved across genetic backgrounds and co-localized with QTLs for leaf rolling and osmotic adjustment (OA). A QTL for percent seed set and grains per panicle under drought stress was identified on chromosome 8 in the same region as a QTL for OA previously identified in three different populations.
24938486	Detection and sequence analysis of two novel co-infecting double-strand RNA mycoviruses in Ustilaginoidea virens.	2014	Arch Virol	Four novel double-stranded RNA molecules, named dsRNA 1 (5124 bp), dsRNA 2(1711 bp), dsRNA 3 (1423 bp) and dsRNA 4 (855 bp), were detected in strain HNHS-1 of Ustilaginoidea virens, the causal agent of rice false smut disease. Sequence analysis showed that the dsRNA1 contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) potentially encoding proteins with modest levels of sequence similarity to the coat protein (CP) and putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively, of viruses of the family Totiviridae. The deduced gene product of the ORF encoded by dsRNA2 is homologous to putative RdRp of viruses in the family Partitiviridae; the ORF encoded by dsRNA3 shares some similarity to a hypothetical protein with unknown function. It is noteworthy that the dsRNA4 lacked integrated ORFs. Isomeric viral particles of about 40 nm in diameter were observed by transmission electron microscopy in a mycelium tissue preparation of strain HNHS-1-R1, a single-spore subculture of strain HNHS-1 containing only the dsRNA1 segment. Phylogenetic analysis and examination of the organization of the two putative RdRp sequences both indicated that there are at least two novel virus species present in strain HNHS-1. We named the two novel viruses Ustilaginoidea virens RNA virus 2 and Ustilaginoidea virens partitivirus 4, respectively.
25017165	Analysis of gene-disruption mutants of a sucrose phosphate synthase gene in rice, OsSPS1, shows the importance of sucrose synthesis in pollen germination.	2014	Plant Sci	The molecular function of an isoform of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in rice, OsSPS1, was investigated using gene-disruption mutant lines generated by retrotransposon insertion. The progeny of the heterozygote of disrupted OsSPS1 (SPS1(+/-)) segregated into SPS1(+/+), SPS1(+/-), and SPS1(-/-) at a ratio of 1:1:0. This distorted segregation ratio, together with the expression of OsSPS1 in the developing pollen revealed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion assay, suggested that the disruption of OsSPS1 results in sterile pollen. This hypothesis was reinforced by reciprocal crosses of SPS1(+/-) plants with wild-type plants in which the disrupted OsSPS1 was not paternally transmitted to the progeny. While the pollen grains of SPS(+/-) plants normally accumulated starch during their development, pollen germination on the artificial media was reduced to half of that observed in the wild-type control. Overall, our data suggests that sucrose synthesis via OsSPS1 is essential in pollen germination in rice.
24893854	Growth promotion and inhibition of the Amazonian wild rice species Oryza grandiglumis to survive flooding.	2014	Planta	In Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), distinct mechanisms to survive flooding are activated in two groups of varieties. Submergence-tolerant rice varieties possessing the SUBMERGENCE1A (SUB1A) gene display reduced growth during flash floods at the seedling stage and resume growth after the flood recedes, whereas deepwater rice varieties possessing the SNORKEL1 (SK1) and SNORKEL2 (SK2) genes display enhanced growth based on internodal elongation during prolonged submergence at the mature stage. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of these growth responses to submergence in the wild rice species Oryza grandiglumis, which is native to the Amazon floodplains. When subjected to gradual submergence, adult plants of O. grandiglumis accessions showed enhanced internodal elongation with rising water level and their growth response closely resembled that of deepwater varieties of O. sativa with high floating capacity. On the other hand, when subjected to complete submergence, seedlings of O. grandiglumis accessions displayed reduced shoot growth and resumed normal growth after desubmergence, similar to the response of submergence-tolerant varieties of O. sativa. Neither SUB1A nor the SK genes were detected in the O. grandiglumis accessions. These results indicate that the O. grandiglumis accessions are capable of adapting successfully to flooding by activating two contrasting mechanisms as the situation demands and that each mechanism of adaptation to flooding is not mediated by SUB1A or the SK genes.
24987297	Genetic polymorphisms in Japanese fragrant landraces and novel fragrant allele domesticated in northern Japan.	2014	Breed Sci	Rice fragrance is an important characteristic for Southeast Asian consumers, and fragrant landraces from Japan were first recorded in the 17th century. Principal component analysis clearly showed that Japanese fragrant landraces were genetically different from non-Japanese fragrant landraces. Japanese fragrant landraces were composed of six clades, none of which carried the most common fragrance mutation, an 8-bp deletion in exon 7 of Badh2. Fragrant landraces comprised two major groups carrying different Badh2 mutations. One group carried a known SNP at exon13 and the other a SNP at the exon1-intron1 junction as splicing donor site. The latter was considered to be a potential splicing mutant group as a novel allele at Badh2. Heterozygosity (He) scores in the two fragrant groups were not significantly different from non-fragrant landraces and modern cultivars. However, lower He scores were found around the Badh2 locus in the two groups. The potential splicing mutant group showed a more extended haplotype than the E13 SNP group. A likely causal factor responsible for loss of function is a novel splicing mutation allele that may have been generated quite recently. The fragrance allele has dispersed as a result of out-crossing under local environmental conditions.
24946831	Identification and characterization of Mini1, a gene regulating rice shoot development.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	The aerial parts of higher plants are generated from the shoot apical meristem (SAM). In this study, we isolated a small rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant that showed premature termination of shoot development and was named mini rice 1 (mini1). The mutant was first isolated from a japonica cultivar Zhonghua11 (ZH11) subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment. With bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and map-based cloning method, Mini1 gene was finally fine-mapped to an interval of 48.6 kb on chromosome 9. Sequence analyses revealed a single base substitution from G to A was found in the region, which resulted in an amino acid change from Gly to Asp. The candidate gene Os09g0363900 was predicted to encode a putative adhesion of calyx edges protein ACE (putative HOTHEAD precursor) and genetic complementation experiment confirmed the identity of Mini1. Os09g0363900 contains glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase and NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-like domain, and exhibits high similarity to Arabidopsis HOTHEAD (HTH). Expression analysis indicated Mini1 was highly expressed in young shoots but lowly in roots and the expression level of most genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction were reduced in mutant. We conclude that Mini1 plays an important role in maintaining SAM activity and promoting shoot development in rice.
24953696	Function of wheat Ta-UnP gene in enhancing salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Based on microarray analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, we identified and cloned an unknown salt-induced gene Ta-UnP (Triticum aestivum unknown protein). Quantitative PCR results revealed that Ta-UnP expression was induced not only by salt but also by polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid, and other environmental stress factors. Under salt stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed Ta-UnP showed superior physiological properties (content of proline, soluble sugar, MDA, and chlorophyll) compared with the control. Subcellular localization demonstrated that Ta-UnP was mainly localized on the cell membrane. The expressions of nine salt tolerance-related genes of Arabidopsis in Ta-UnP-overexpressed Arabidopsis were analyzed via qPCR, and the results revealed that the expressions of SOS2, SOS3, RD29B, and P5CS were significantly up-regulated, whereas the other five genes only slightly changed. The results of the salt tolerance analysis indicated that Ta-UnP can enhance the salt tolerance of transgenic rice plants, and RNAi transgenic rice plants became highly susceptible to salt stress. The results from this study indicate that this novel Ta-UnP may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to salt stress.
24981923	Strigolactone biosynthesis and perception.	2014	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Strigolactones (SLs) are plant hormones that regulate shoot branching as well as known as root-derived signals for parasitic and symbiotic interactions. Since the first discovery of a naturally occurring SL, strigol, more than 40 years ago, the biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. Recently, it was partially uncovered through the functional analysis of some biosynthetic components that were discovered from genetic studies using SL-deficient mutants. In addition, a perception component was also characterized through genetic and biochemical studies of a rice SL-insensitive mutant, dwarf14. In this review, we describe new findings on SL biosynthesis and focus on a recently identified SL precursor, carlactone. We also describe the perception mechanisms by an α/β-fold hydrolase family protein.
25040950	Dissection of additive, epistatic effect and QTL × environment interaction of quantitative trait loci for sheath blight resistance in rice.	2014	Hereditas	A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross between 'HH1B' and 'RSB02' (a deep-water rice variety with resistance to sheath blight) was planted in two locations for four different growing seasons. Seven traits were used to evaluate the disease severity, namely disease rating (DR), lesion length (LL), lesion height (LH), relative lesion length (RLL), relative lesion height (RLH), plant height (PH) and heading date (HD). Based on a linkage map of 163 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, a total of 37 QTLs were mapped on nine chromosomes. Additionally, 32 epistatic QTLs were identified, distributed on all the 12 chromosomes. The contribution of a single QTL's additive and epistatic effect was of low magnitude for most cases (from 0.39% to 24.62%). Among QTL × environment interaction test, 28 additive QTLs and six pairs of epistatic interactions were involved. Correlation analysis showed that DR had significant positive correlations with LL, RLL and RLH, but had a negative correlation with PH, two of six QTLs controlling DR were mapped in the same chromosome regions as the QTLs controlling PH. The alleles which can enhance disease resistance and increase PH are from the resistant parent 'RSB02', indicating that PH has certain effect on sheath blight resistance in the present study.
24950734	Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of DNA methyltransferase gene family in maize.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: In this study, we identified eight DNA MTase genes in maize and the diversity of expression patterns of them was presented by EST mining, microarray and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in promoting genomic stability through diverse biological processes including regulation of gene expression during development and chromatin organization. Although this important biological process is mainly regulated by several conserved Cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases encoded by a smaller multigene family in plants, investigation of the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the C5-MTase-encoding gene family have been characterized in multiple plant species including Arabidopsis, rice, carrot and wheat. However, little is known regarding the C5-MTase-encoding genes in the entire maize genome. Here, genome-wide identification and expression profile analyses of maize C5-MTase-encoding genes (ZmMETs) were performed from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the orthologs from the three species (maize, Arabidopsis and rice) were categorized into four classes. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on 6 of all 10 chromosomes with three chromosomal/segmental duplication events, suggesting that gene duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize C5-MTase-encoding gene family. Furthermore, EST expression data mining, microarray data and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments have demonstrated that these genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmMET genes family. Overall, our study will serve to present signification insights to explore the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene expression and function and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants.
24937109	Advances to improve the eating and cooking qualities of rice by marker-assisted breeding.	2016	Crit Rev Biotechnol	The eating and cooking qualities of rice are heavily emphasized in breeding programs because they determine market values and they are the appealing attributes sought by consumers. Conventional breeding has developed traditional varieties with improved eating and cooking qualities. Recently, intensive genetic studies have pinpointed the genes that control eating and cooking quality traits. Advances in genetic studies have developed molecular techniques, thereby allowing marker-assisted breeding (MAB) for improved eating and cooking qualities in rice. MAB has gained the attention of rice breeders for the advantages it can offer that conventional breeding cannot. There have been successful cases of using MAB to improve the eating and cooking qualities in rice over the years. Nevertheless, MAB should be applied cautiously given the intensive effort needed for genotyping. Perspectives from conventional breeding to marker-assisted breeding will be discussed in this review for the advancement of the eating and cooking qualities of fragrance, amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) in rice. These four parameters are associated with eating and cooking qualities in rice. The genetic basis of these four parameters is also included in this review. MAB is another approach to rice variety improvement and development in addition to being an alternative to genetic engineering. The MAB approach shortens the varietal development time, and is therefore able to deliver improved rice varieties to farmers within a shorter period of time.
25093205	Response of rice genotypes to weed competition in dry direct-seeded rice in India.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	The differential weed-competitive abilities of eight rice genotypes and the traits that may confer such attributes were investigated under partial weedy and weed-free conditions in naturally occurring weed flora in dry direct-seeded rice during the rainy seasons of 2011 and 2012 at Ludhiana, Punjab, India. The results showed genotypic differences in competitiveness against weeds. In weed-free plots, grain yield varied from 6.6 to 8.9 t ha(-1) across different genotypes; it was lowest for PR-115 and highest for the hybrid H-97158. In partial weedy plots, grain yield and weed biomass at flowering varied from 3.6 to 6.7 t ha(-1) and from 174 to 419 g m(-2), respectively. In partial weedy plots, grain yield was lowest for PR-115 and highest for PR-120. Average yield loss due to weed competition ranged from 21 to 46% in different rice genotypes. The study showed that early canopy closure, high leaf area index at early stage, and high root biomass and volume correlated positively with competitiveness. This study suggests that some traits (root biomass, leaf area index, and shoot biomass at the early stage) could play an important role in conferring weed competitiveness and these traits can be explored for dry-seeded rice.
24962048	Isolation, structural analysis, and expression characteristics of the maize (Zea mays L.) hexokinase gene family.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Hexokinases (HXKs, EC 2.7.1.1) play important roles in metabolism, glucose (Glc) signaling, and phosphorylation of Glc and fructose and are ubiquitous in all organisms. Despite their physiological importance, the maize HXK (ZmHXK) genes have not been analyzed systematically. We isolated and characterized nine members of the ZmHXK gene family which were distributed on 3 of the 10 maize chromosomes. A multiple sequence alignment and motif analysis revealed that the maize ZmHXK proteins share three conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ZmHXK family can be divided into four subfamilies. We identified putative cis-elements in the ZmHXK promoter sequences potentially involved in phytohormone and abiotic stress responses, sugar repression, light and circadian rhythm regulation, Ca(2+) responses, seed development and germination, and CO2-responsive transcriptional activation. To study the functions of maize HXK isoforms, we characterized the expression of the ZmHXK5 and ZmHXK6 genes, which are evolutionarily related to the OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 genes from rice. Analysis of tissue-specific expression patterns using quantitative real time-PCR showed that ZmHXK5 was highly expressed in tassels, while ZmHXK6 was expressed in both tassels and leaves. ZmHXK5 and ZmHXK6 expression levels were upregulated by phytohormones and by abiotic stress.
24920304	A rice chloroplast transit peptide sequence does not alter the cytoplasmic localization of sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase expressed in transgenic rice plants.	2014	J Pineal Res	Ectopic overexpression of melatonin biosynthetic genes of animal origin has been used to generate melatonin-rich transgenic plants to examine the functional roles of melatonin in plants. However, the subcellular localization of these proteins expressed in the transgenic plants remains unknown. We studied the localization of sheep (Ovis aries) serotonin N-acetyltransferase (OaSNAT) and a translational fusion of a rice SNAT transit peptide to OaSNAT (TS:OaSNAT) in plants. Laser confocal microscopy analysis revealed that both OaSNAT and TS:OaSNAT proteins were localized to the cytoplasm even with the addition of the transit sequence to OaSNAT. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the TS:OaSNAT fusion transgene exhibited high SNAT enzyme activity relative to untransformed wild-type plants, but lower activity than transgenic rice plants expressing the wild-type OaSNAT gene. Melatonin levels in both types of transgenic rice plant corresponded well with SNAT enzyme activity levels. The TS:OaSNAT transgenic lines exhibited increased seminal root growth relative to wild-type plants, but less than in the OaSNAT transgenic lines, confirming that melatonin promotes root growth. Seed-specific OaSNAT expression under the control of a rice prolamin promoter did not confer high levels of melatonin production in transgenic rice seeds compared with seeds from transgenic plants expressing OaSNAT under the control of the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter.
24911169	Genome-wide mapping of virulence in brown planthopper identifies loci that break down host plant resistance.	2014	PLoS One	Insects and plants have coexisted for over 350 million years and their interactions have affected ecosystems and agricultural practices worldwide. Variation in herbivorous insects' virulence to circumvent host resistance has been extensively documented. However, despite decades of investigation, the genetic foundations of virulence are currently unknown. The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) is the most destructive rice (Oryza sativa) pest in the world. The identification of the resistance gene Bph1 and its introduction in commercial rice varieties prompted the emergence of a new virulent brown planthopper biotype that was able to break the resistance conferred by Bph1. In this study, we aimed to construct a high density linkage map for the brown planthopper and identify the loci responsible for its virulence in order to determine their genetic architecture. Based on genotyping data for hundreds of molecular markers in three mapping populations, we constructed the most comprehensive linkage map available for this species, covering 96.6% of its genome. Fifteen chromosomes were anchored with 124 gene-specific markers. Using genome-wide scanning and interval mapping, the Qhp7 locus that governs preference for Bph1 plants was mapped to a 0.1 cM region of chromosome 7. In addition, two major QTLs that govern the rate of insect growth on resistant rice plants were identified on chromosomes 5 (Qgr5) and 14 (Qgr14). This is the first study to successfully locate virulence in the genome of this important agricultural insect by marker-based genetic mapping. Our results show that the virulence which overcomes the resistance conferred by Bph1 is controlled by a few major genes and that the components of virulence originate from independent genetic characters. The isolation of these loci will enable the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the rice-brown planthopper interaction and facilitate the development of durable approaches for controlling this most destructive agricultural insect.
24819479	Imprinting in rice: the role of DNA and histone methylation in modulating parent-of-origin specific expression and determining transcript start sites.	2014	Plant J	Over 200 imprinted genes in rice endosperm are known, but the mechanisms modulating their parental allele-specific expression are poorly understood. Here we use three imprinted genes, OsYUCCA11, yellow2-like and ubiquitin hydrolase, to show that differential DNA methylation and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3 ) in the promoter and/or gene body influences allele-specific expression or the site of transcript initiation. Paternal expression of OsYUCCA11 required DNA methylation in the gene body whereas the gene body of the silenced maternal allele was hypomethylated and marked with H3K27me3 . These differential markings mirror those proposed to modulate paternal expression of two Arabidopsis genes, PHERES1 and a YUCCA homolog, indicating conservation of imprinting mechanisms. At yellow2-like, DNA hypomethylation in the upstream flanking region resulted in maternal transcripts that were longer than paternal transcripts; the maternal transcript initiation site was marked by DNA methylation in the paternal allele, and transcription initiated ~700 bp downstream. The paternal allele of an ubiquitin hydrolase gene exhibited gene body DNA methylation and produced full-length transcripts, while the maternal allele was hypomethylated in the 5' gene body and transcripts initiated from a downstream promoter. Inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-azacytidine or zebularine activated the long transcripts from yellow2-like and enhanced expression of the short transcripts from the ubiquitin hydrolase in seedlings, indicating that DNA methylation prevents transcript initiation from cryptic promoters. These observations suggest a paradigm whereby maternal genome hypomethylation is associated with the production of distinct transcripts, potentially diversifying the gene products from the two alleles.
24899551	Earliest colonization events of Rhizophagus irregularis in rice roots occur preferentially in previously uncolonized cells.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form a symbiotic association with several plant species. An arbuscule, a finely branched structure of AM fungi, is formed in root cells and plays essential roles in resource exchange. Because arbuscules are ephemeral, host cells containing collapsed arbuscules can be recolonized, and a wide region of roots can be continuously colonized by AM fungi, suggesting that repetitive recolonization in root cells is required for continuous mycorrhization. However, recolonization frequency has not been quantified because of the lack of appropriate markers for visualization of the cellular processes after arbuscule collapse; therefore, the nature of the colonization sequence remains uncertain. Here we observed that a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged secretory carrier membrane protein (SCAMP) of rice was expressed even in cells with collapsed arbuscules, allowing live imaging coupled with GFP-SCAMP to evaluate the colonization and recolonization sequences. The average lifetime of intact arbuscules was 1-2 d. Cells with collapsed arbuscules were rarely recolonized and formed a new arbuscule during the observation period of 5 d, whereas de novo colonization occurred even in close proximity to cells containing collapsed arbuscules and contributed to the expansion of the colonized region. Colonization spread into an uncolonized region of roots but sparsely into a previously colonized region having no metabolically active arbuscule but several intercellular hyphae. Therefore, we propose that a previously colonized region tends to be intolerant to new colonization in rice roots. Our observations highlight the overlooked negative impact of the degeneration stage of arbuscules in the colonization sequence.
25358159	[Testing of germination rate of hybrid rice seeds based on near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy].	2014	Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi	Germination rate of rice seeds was measured according to technical stipulation of germination testing for agricultural crop seeds at present. There existed many faults for this technical stipulation such as long experimental period, more costing and higher professional requirement. A rapid and non-invasive method was put forward to measure the germination rate of hybrid rice seeds based on near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Two varieties of hybrid rice seeds were aged artificially at temperature 45 degrees C and humidity 100% condition for 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h. Spectral data of 280 samples for 2 varieties of hybrid rice seeds with different aging time were acquired individually by near-infrared spectra analyzer. Spectral data of 280 samples for 2 varieties of hybrid rice seeds were randomly divided into calibration set (168 samples) and prediction set (112 samples). Gormination rate of rice seed with different aging time was tested. Regression model was established by using partial least squares (PLS). The effect of the different spectral bands on the accuracy of models was analyzed and the effect of the different spectral preprocessing methods on the accuracy of models was also compared. Optimal model was achieved under the whole bands and by using standardization and orthogonal signal correction (OSC) preprocessing algorithms with CM2000 software for spectral data of 2 varieties of hybrid rice seeds, the coefficient of determination of the calibration set (Rc) and that of the prediction set (Rp) were 0.965 and 0.931 individually, standard error of calibration set (SEC) and that of prediction set (SEP) were 1.929 and 2.899 respectively. Relative error between tested value and predicted value for prediction set of rice seeds is below 4.2%. The experimental results show that it is feasible that rice germination rate is detected rapidly and nondestructively by using the near-infrared spectroscopy analysis technology.
24924297	Proteomic analysis of proteins related to rice grain chalkiness using iTRAQ and a novel comparison system based on a notched-belly mutant with white-belly.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Grain chalkiness is a complex trait adversely affecting appearance and milling quality, and therefore has been one of principal targets for rice improvement. Eliminating chalkiness from rice has been a daunting task due to the complex interaction between genotype and environment and the lack of molecular markers. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain chalkiness formation are still imperfectly understood.

RESULTS: We identified a notched-belly mutant (DY1102) with high percentage of white-belly, which only occurs in the bottom part proximal to the embryo. Using this mutant, a novel comparison system that can minimize the effect of genetic background and growing environment was developed. An iTRAQ-based comparative display of the proteins between the bottom chalky part and the upper translucent part of grains of DY1102 was performed. A total of 113 proteins responsible for chalkiness formation was identified. Among them, 70 proteins are up-regulated and 43 down-regulated. Approximately half of these differentially expressed proteins involved in central metabolic or regulatory pathways including carbohydrate metabolism (especially cell wall synthesis) and protein synthesis, folding and degradation, providing proteomic confirmation of the notion that chalkiness formation involves diverse but delicately regulated pathways. Protein metabolism was the most abundant category, accounting for 27.4% of the total differentially expressed proteins. In addition, down regulation of PDIL 2-3 and BiP was detected in the chalky tissue, indicating the important role of protein metabolism in grain chalkiness formation.

CONCLUSIONS: Using this novel comparison system, our comprehensive survey of endosperm proteomics in the notched-belly mutant provides a valuable proteomic resource for the characterization of pathways contributing to chalkiness formation at molecular and biochemical levels.
24945975	Effects of the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent Gd-DTPA on plant growth and root imaging in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Although paramagnetic contrast agents have a wide range of applications in medical studies involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these agents are seldom used to enhance MRI images of plant root systems. To extend the application of MRI contrast agents to plant research and to develop related techniques to study root systems, we examined the applicability of the MRI contrast agent Gd-DTPA to the imaging of rice roots. Specifically, we examined the biological effects of various concentrations of Gd-DTPA on rice growth and MRI images. Analysis of electrical conductivity and plant height demonstrated that 5 mmol Gd-DTPA had little impact on rice in the short-term. The results of signal intensity and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) analysis suggested that 5 mmol Gd-DTPA was the appropriate concentration for enhancing MRI signals. In addition, examination of the long-term effects of Gd-DTPA on plant height showed that levels of this compound up to 5 mmol had little impact on rice growth and (to some extent) increased the biomass of rice.
24888399	High light acclimation of Oryza sativa L. leaves involves specific photosynthetic-sourced changes of NADPH/NADP⁺ in the midvein.	2015	Protoplasma	Previous studies have shown that exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to high light (HL) causes a systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) response in the vasculature. It has been postulated that C₄-like photosynthesis in the leaf veins triggers this response via the Mehler reaction. To investigate this proposed connection and extend SAA to other plants, we examined the redox state of NADPH, ascorbate (ASA), and glutathione (GSH) pools; levels and histochemical localization of O₂- and H₂O₂ signals; and activities of antioxidant enzymes in the midvein and leaf lamina of rice, when they were subjected to HL and low light. The results showed that (1) high NADPH/NADP(+) was generated by C₄-like photosynthesis under HL in the midvein and (2) SAA was colocally induced by HL, as indicated by the combined signaling network, including the decrease in redox status of ASA and GSH pools, accumulation of H₂O₂ and O₂- signals, and high superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. The high correlations between these occurrences suggest that the enhanced NADPH/NADP(+) in HL-treated midveins might alter redox status of ASA and GSH pools and trigger H₂O₂ and O₂- signals during SAA via the Mehler reaction. These changes in turn upregulate SOD and APX activities in the midvein. In conclusion, SAA may be a common regulatory mechanism for the adaptation of angiosperms to HL. Manipulation of NADPH/NADP(+) levels by C₄-like photosynthesis promotes SAA under HL stress in the midvein.
25028572	Examination of the leaf proteome during flooding stress and the induction of programmed cell death in maize.	2014	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: Maize is a major economic crop worldwide, with substantial crop loss attributed to flooding. During a stress response, programmed cell death (PCD) can be an effective way for plants better adapt. To identify flooding stress related PCD proteins in maize leaves, proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry.

RESULTS: Comparative proteomics was combined with physiological and biochemical analysis of maize leaves under flooding stress. Fv/Fm, qP, qN and relative water content (RWC) were found to be altered in response to flooding stress, with an increase in H2O2 content noted in vivo. Furthermore, DNA ladder detection indicated that PCD had occurred under flooding treatment. The maize leaf proteome was analyzed via 2D-DIGE gel, with a total of 32 differentially expressed spots isolated, 31 spots were successfully identified via MALDI-TOF/TOF MS which represent 28 proteins. The identified proteins were related to energy metabolism and photosynthesis, PCD, phytohormones and polyamines. To better characterize the role of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) in PCD during a stress response, mRNA expression was examined in different plants by stress-induced PCD. These included heat stress induced rice protoplasts, Tobacco Mosaic Virus infected tobacco leaves and dark induced rice and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, all of which showed active PCD, and TCTP expression was increased in different degrees. Moreover, S-adenosylmethionine synthase 2 (SAMS2) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) mRNA expression were also increased, but ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) mRNA expression were not found in maize leaves following flooding. Lastly, ethylene and polyamine concentrations were increased in response to flooding treatment in maize leaves.

CONCLUSIONS: Following flooding stress, the photosynthetic systems were damaged, resulting in a disruption in energy metabolism, with the noted photosynthetic decline also possibly attributed to ROS production. The observed PCD could be regulated by TCTP with a possible role for H2O2 in TCTP induction under flooding stress. Additionally, increased SAMS2 expression was closely associated with an increased polyamine synthesis during flooding treatment.
24972305	Improvement of nitrogen accumulation and metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by the endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	The fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari can enhance nitrogen (N) uptake and metabolism of rice plants under hydroponic conditions. To investigate the effects of P. liquidambari on N accumulation and metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under field conditions during the entire growing season (S1, the seedling stage; S2, the tillering stage; S3, the heading stage; S4, the ripening stage), we utilized pot experiments to examine metabolic and physiological levels in both shoot and root tissues of rice, with endophyte (E+) and without endophyte (E-), in response to three different N levels. We found that under low-N treatment, P. liquidambari symbiosis increased the rice yield and N use efficiency by 12% and by 11.59%, respectively; that the total N contents in E+ rice plants at the four growth stages were separately increased by 29.05%, 14.65%, 21.06% and 18.38%, respectively; and that the activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase in E+ rice roots and shoots were significantly increased by fungal infection during the S1 to S3 stages. Moreover, P. liquidambari significantly increased the free NH4(+), NO3(-), amino acid and soluble protein contents in infected rice tissues under low-N treatment during the S1 to S3 stages. The obtained results offer novel data concerning the systemic changes induced by P. liquidambari in rice during the entire growth period and confirm the hypothesis that the rice-P. liquidambari interaction improved the N accumulation and metabolism of rice plants, consequently increasing rice N utilization in nutrient-limited soil.
25158521	[Long-term effects of tillage methods on heavy metal accumulation and availability in purple paddy soil].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	A long-term experiment, conducted at Southwest University since 1990, was used to evaluate the effect of tillage methods on the total and available contents of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) in the profile of purple paddy soil and the contents of those metals in root, stem leaf and brown rice. The experiment included five tillage methods: conventional tillage, paddy-upland rotation, no-tillage and fallow in winter, ridge-no-tillage and compartments-no-tillage. The results showed that the total concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in the soil profile had no significant differences among five treatments, but it was found that total Mn has a significant decline in 0-20 cm under conventional tillage, paddy-upland rotation and no-tillage and fallow in winter compared with ridge-no-tillage and compartments-no-tillage. The availability of Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd decreased with the increase of soil depth in all treatments, but the availability of Mn was found to be the highest in the 20-40 cm layers except those in the paddy-upland rotation. In the ploughed layer, the contents of available Fe, Mn was the highest in paddy-upland rotation, while the contents of available Zn and Pb was the highest in conventional tillage, but tillage treatments had not significant influence to the contents of available Cu. Correlation analysis showed that available Fe was significantly negatively related to the pH values and significantly negatively related to the organic matter of soils, available Mn was significantly negatively related to the pH values and organic matter of soils, whereas the available Zn was significantly positively related to total Zn. The contents of Fe, Mn in rice root, the contents of Fe, Mn, Cu and Cd in rice straw and Cu in brown rice were higher under paddy-upland rotation, ridge-no-tillage and compartments-no-tillage than those in conventional tillage and no-tillage and fellow in winter. Paddy-upland rotation can significantly lower the migration coefficient value of Cd in brown rice, and the Pb, Cd concentration in brown rice in the treatment of paddy-upland rotation was lower than the upper limit (< 0.2 mg x kg(-1)) of the National Standard for Food Hygiene for Cd concentration. The content of Fe in root was significantly and negatively related with soil pH and significantly and positively related with soil available Fe, the content of Mn in root was significantly negatively related with soil pH and significantly positively related with soil available Mn, the content of Mn in straw was significantly negatively related with soil pH, significantly positively related with soil total Mn and significantly positively related with soil available Mn, the content of Cu in straw and brown rice was significantly negatively related with soil pH, the content of Zn was significant related with soil pH and significant related with soil CEC. The content of Fe in root, Mn in root and straw and Cd in straw was positively related with soil available Fe, Mn and Cd, respectively, but was negatively related with pH in plough layer soil, Zn in straw was also negatively related with plough layer soil pH. From the results as above, it is concluded that different tillage methods can change the values of soil pH, alter the availability of heavy metal in soils, consequently affect uptake of heavy metal by rice. Of the tillage methods, paddy-upland rotation could increase the availability of Fe and Mn, but decrease the availability of Zn, Pb and Cd in purple paddy soils. Paddy-upland rotation can also increase the contents of Fe, Mn in rice root and straw, but decrease Cd content in brown rice, and could reduce the Pb, Cd contents in brown rice in a certain extent, however, attention should be given to long-term paddy-upland rotation cause of leaching of soil surface Mn.
24798203	OsABCB14 functions in auxin transport and iron homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant J	Members of the ATP Binding Cassette B/Multidrug-Resistance/P-glyco-protein (ABCB/MDR/PGP) subfamily were shown to function primarily in Oryza sativa (rice) auxin transport; however, none of the rice ABCB transporters have been functionally characterized. Here, we describe that a knock-down of OsABCB14 confers decreased auxin concentrations and polar auxin transport rates, conferring insensitivity to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). OsABCB14 displays enhanced specific auxin influx activity in yeast and protoplasts prepared from rice knock-down alleles. OsABCB14 is localized at the plasma membrane, pointing to an important directionality under physiological conditions. osabcb14 mutants were surprisingly found to be insensitive to iron deficiency treatment (-Fe). Their Fe concentration is higher and upregulation of Fe deficiency-responsive genes is lower in osabcb14 mutants than in wild-type rice (Nipponbare, NIP). Taken together, our results strongly support the role of OsABCB14 as an auxin influx transporter involved in Fe homeostasis. The functional characterization of OsABCB14 provides insights in monocot auxin transport and its relationship to Fe nutrition.
24987490	Split luciferase complementation assay to detect regulated protein-protein interactions in rice protoplasts in a large-scale format.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice interactome, in which a network of protein-protein interactions has been elucidated in rice, is a useful resource to identify functional modules of rice signal transduction pathways. Protein-protein interactions occur in cells in two ways, constitutive and regulative. While a yeast-based high-throughput method has been widely used to identify the constitutive interactions, a method to detect the regulated interactions is rarely developed for a large-scale analysis.

RESULTS: A split luciferase complementation assay was applied to detect the regulated interactions in rice. A transformation method of rice protoplasts in a 96-well plate was first established for a large-scale analysis. In addition, an antibody that specifically recognizes a carboxyl-terminal fragment of Renilla luciferase was newly developed. A pair of antibodies that recognize amino- and carboxyl- terminal fragments of Renilla luciferase, respectively, was then used to monitor quality and quantity of interacting recombinant-proteins accumulated in the cells. For a proof-of-concept, the method was applied to detect the gibberellin-dependent interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 and SLENDER RICE 1.

CONCLUSIONS: A method to detect regulated protein-protein interactions was developed towards establishment of the rice interactome.
24939891	Molecular analysis of Oryza latifolia Desv. (CCDD genome)-derived introgression lines and identification of value-added traits for rice (O. sativa L.) improvement.	None	J Hered	Oryza latifolia is a tetraploid wild Oryza species with a CCDD genome that has been reported to harbor resistance to bacterial blight (BB), brown planthopper, and whitebacked planthopper. Aside from these traits, O. latifolia is also being tapped as a new source of resistance to lodging and high biomass production. To explore the genetic potential of O. latifolia as a novel genetic resource for the improvement of existing O. sativa cultivars, 27 disomic derivatives of O. latifolia monosomic alien addition lines (MAAL) were characterized for alien chromosome segment introgressions and evaluated for yield components, BB resistance, and strong stem characteristics. A total of 167 simple sequence repeat, sequence tagged site, and single nucleotide polymorphism markers, along with newly developed indel markers that were specifically designed to detect O. latifolia chromosome segment introgressions in an O. sativa background, were used to define alien introgressions in 27 disomics derived from O. latifolia MAALs. Genotype data showed that 32 unique introgressions spanning 0.31-22.73 Mb were introgressed in different combinations in each of the 27 disomic derivatives. Evaluation of the disomic derivatives for agronomic traits identified lines with putative QTLs for resistance to Philippine races 3A, 4, 9A, and 9D of BB. Putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring strong stem in 19 out of the 27 disomic derivatives studied were also identified from O. latifolia introgressions on chromosome 6.
24963001	OsNRAMP5 contributes to manganese translocation and distribution in rice shoots.	2014	J Exp Bot	Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient for plants playing an important role in many physiological functions. OsNRAMP5 is a major transporter responsible for Mn and cadmium uptake in rice, but whether it is involved in the root-to-shoot translocation and distribution of these metals is unknown. In this work, OsNRAMP5 was found to be highly expressed in hulls. It was also expressed in leaves but the expression level decreased with leaf age. High-magnification observations revealed that OsNRAMP5 was enriched in the vascular bundles of roots and shoots especially in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem. The osnramp5 mutant accumulated significantly less Mn in shoots than the wild-type plants even at high levels of Mn supply. Furthermore, a high supply of Mn could compensate for the loss in the root uptake ability in the mutant, but not in the root-to-shoot translocation of Mn, suggesting that the absence of OsNRAMP5 reduces the transport of Mn from roots to shoots. The results suggest that OsNRAMP5 plays an important role in the translocation and distribution of Mn in rice plants in addition to its role in Mn uptake.
24794921	Identification and characterization of suppressor mutants of spl11- mediated cell death in rice.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Lesion mimic mutants have been used to dissect programmed cell death (PCD) and defense-related pathways in plants. The rice lesion-mimic mutant spl11 exhibits race nonspecific resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Spl11 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is a negative regulator of PCD in rice. To study the regulation of Spl11-mediated PCD, we performed a genetic screen and identified three spl11 cell-death suppressor (sds) mutants. These suppressors were characterized for their resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae and M. oryzae and for their expression of defense-related genes. The suppression of the cell-death phenotypes was generally correlated with reduced expression of defense-related genes. When rice was challenged with avirulent isolates of M. oryzae, the disease phenotype was unaffected in the sds mutants, indicating that the suppression might be Spl11-mediated pathway specific and may only be involved in basal defense. In addition, we mapped one of the suppressor mutations to a 140-kb interval on the long arm of rice chromosome 1. Identification and characterization of these sds mutants should facilitate our efforts to elucidate the Spl11-mediated PCD pathway.
24948669	Selenium addition alters mercury uptake, bioavailability in the rhizosphere and root anatomy of rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mercury (Hg) is an extremely toxic pollutant, especially in the form of methylmercury (MeHg), whereas selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in the human diet. This study aimed to ascertain whether addition of Se can produce rice with enriched Se and lowered Hg content when growing in Hg-contaminated paddy fields and, if so, to determine the possible mechanisms behind these effects.

METHODS: Two cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa, japonica and indica) were grown in either hydroponic solutions or soil rhizobags with different Se and Hg treatments. Concentrations of total Hg, MeHg and Se were determined in the roots, shoots and brown rice, together with Hg uptake kinetics and Hg bioavailability in the soil. Root anatonmy was also studied.

KEY RESULTS: The high Se treatment (5 μg g(-1)) significantly increased brown rice yield by 48 % and total Se content by 2·8-fold, and decreased total Hg and MeHg by 47 and 55 %, respectively, compared with the control treatments. The high Se treatment also markedly reduced 'water-soluble' Hg and MeHg concentrations in the rhizosphere soil, decreased the uptake capacity of Hg by roots and enhanced the development of apoplastic barriers in the root endodermis.

CONCLUSIONS: Addition of Se to Hg-contaminated soil can help produce brown rice that is simultaneously enriched in Se and contains less total Hg and MeHg. The lowered accumulation of total Hg and MeHg appears to be the result of reduced bioavailability of Hg and production of MeHg in the rhizosphere, suppression of uptake of Hg into the root cells and an enhancement of the development of apoplastic barriers in the endodermis of the roots.
24906815	Comparative genetic mapping and genomic region collinearity analysis of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm41.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: By applying comparative genomics analyses, a high-density genetic linkage map narrowed the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm41 originating from wild emmer in a sub-centimorgan genetic interval. Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, results in large yield losses worldwide. A high-density genetic linkage map of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm41, originating from wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) and previously mapped to the distal region of chromosome 3BL bin 0.63-1.00, was constructed using an F5:6 recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross of durum wheat cultivar Langdon and wild emmer accession IW2. By applying comparative genomics analyses, 19 polymorphic sequence-tagged site markers were developed and integrated into the Pm41 genetic linkage map. Ultimately, Pm41 was mapped in a 0.6 cM genetic interval flanked by markers XWGGC1505 and XWGGC1507, which correspond to 11.7, 19.2, and 24.9 kb orthologous genomic regions in Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum, respectively. The XWGGC1506 marker co-segregated with Pm41 and could be served as a starting point for chromosome landing and map-based cloning as well as marker-assisted selection of Pm41. Detailed comparative genomics analysis of the markers flanking the Pm41 locus in wheat and the putative orthologous genes in Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum suggests that the gene order is highly conserved between rice and sorghum. However, intra-chromosome inversions and re-arrangements are evident in the wheat and Brachypodium genomic regions, and gene duplications are also present in the orthologous genomic regions of Pm41 in wheat, indicating that the Brachypodium gene model can provide more useful information for wheat marker development.
25053919	mPing: The bursting transposon.	2014	Breed Sci	Though transposable elements (TEs) have been considered as an efficient source of evolution, it has never been possible to test this hypothesis because most of TE insertions had occurred millions of years ago, or because currently active TEs have very few copies in a host genome. However, mPing, the first active DNA transposon in rice, was revealed to hold a key to answer this question. mPing has attained high copy numbers and still retained very high activity in a traditional rice strain, which enabled direct observation of behavior and impact of a bursting TE. A comprehensive analysis of mPing insertion sites has revealed it avoids exons but prefers promoter regions and thus moderately affects transcription of neighboring genes. Some of the mPing insertions have introduced possibly useful expression profile to adjacent genes that indicated TE's potential in de novo formation of gene regulatory network.
24891164	Gibberellin biosynthesis and signal transduction is essential for internode elongation in deepwater rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Under flooded conditions, the leaves and internodes of deepwater rice can elongate above the water surface to capture oxygen and prevent drowning. Our previous studies showed that three major quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulate deepwater-dependent internode elongation in deepwater rice. In this study, we investigated the age-dependent internode elongation in deepwater rice. We also investigated the relationship between deepwater-dependent internode elongation and the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) by physiological and genetic approach using a QTL pyramiding line (NIL-1 + 3 + 12). Deepwater rice did not show internode elongation before the sixth leaf stage under deepwater condition. Additionally, deepwater-dependent internode elongation occurred on the sixth and seventh internodes during the sixth leaf stage. These results indicate that deepwater rice could not start internode elongation until the sixth leaf stage. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the phytohormone contents showed a deepwater-dependent GA1 and GA4 accumulation in deepwater rice. Additionally, a GA inhibitor abolished deepwater-dependent internode elongation in deepwater rice. On the contrary, GA feeding mimicked internode elongation under ordinary growth conditions. However, mutations in GA biosynthesis and signal transduction genes blocked deepwater-dependent internode elongation. These data suggested that GA biosynthesis and signal transduction are essential for deepwater-dependent internode elongation in deepwater rice.
25053643	Alleviation of aluminium-induced cell rigidity by overexpression of OsPIN2 in rice roots.	2014	J Exp Bot	Al-induced cell rigidity is one of the symptoms of Al toxicity, but the mechanism by which plants tolerate this toxicity is still unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of OsPIN2, an auxin transporter gene, could alleviate Al-induced cell rigidity in rice root apices. A freeze-thawing experiment showed that the Al-treated roots of wild-type (WT) plants had more damage in the epidermal and outer cortex cells than that found in lines overexpressing OsPIN2 (OXs), and the freeze-disrupt coefficient was 2-fold higher in the former than in the latter. Furthermore, Al could induce aberrations of the cell wall-plasma membrane interface, which was more prominent in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone of the WT. Overexpressed OsPIN2 reduced Al-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and weakened Al-induced lipid peroxidation and lignification in roots. Compared with WT, a 16.6-32.6% lower Al-triggered hemicellulose 1 accumulation was observed in root apices of OXs, and 17.4-20.5% less Al accumulated in the cell wall of OXs. Furthermore, overexpression of OsPIN2 ameliorated the Al inhibitory effect on basipetal auxin transport and increased Al-induced IAA and proton release. Taken together, our results suggest that by decreasing the binding of Al to the cell wall and Al-targeted oxidative cellular damage, OXs lines show less Al-induced damage. By modulating PIN2-based auxin transport, IAA efflux, and cell wall acidification, lines overexpressing OsPIN2 alleviate Al-induced cell rigidity in the rice root apex.
24841874	Comparative proteomic analysis of early salt stress responsive proteins in roots and leaves of rice.	2014	Proteomics	Growth and productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) are severely affected by salinity. Understanding the mechanisms that protect rice and other important cereal crops from salt stress will help in the development of salt-stress-tolerant strains. In this study, rice seedlings of the same genetic species with various salt tolerances were studied. We first used 2DE to resolve the expressed proteome in rice roots and leaves and then used nanospray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to identify the differentially expressed proteins in rice seedlings after salt treatment. The 2DE assays revealed that there were 104 differentially expressed protein spots in rice roots and 59 in leaves. Then, we identified 83 proteins in rice roots and 61 proteins in rice leaves by MS analysis. Functional classification analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins from roots could be classified into 18 functional categories while those from leaves could be classified into 11 functional categories. The proteins from rice seedlings that most significantly contributed to a protective effect against increased salinity were cysteine synthase, adenosine triphosphate synthase, quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase 1, and lipoxygenase 2. Further analysis demonstrated that the primary mechanisms underlying the ability of rice seedlings to tolerate salt stress were glycolysis, purine metabolism, and photosynthesis. Thus, we suggest that differentially expressed proteins may serve as marker group for the salt tolerance of rice.
24995697	Quantitative trait Loci mapping for bacterial blight resistance in rice using bulked segregant analysis.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	Oryza meyeriana is highly resistant to rice bacterial blight (BB) and this resistance trait has been transferred to cultivated rice (O. sativa) using asymmetric somatic hybridization. However, no resistance genes have yet been cloned. In the present study, a progeny of the somatic hybridization with high BB resistance was crossed with a rice cultivar with high BB susceptibility to develop an F2 population. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA), 17 polymorphic markers that were linked to rice BB resistance were obtained through scanning a total of 186 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, evenly distributed on 12 chromosomes. A genetic linkage map was then constructed based on the 17 linkage markers and the F2 segregating population, which was followed by mapping for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for BB resistance. Three QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5, respectively, and the alleles of the resistant parent at any of the QTLs increased BB resistance. All of the three QTLs had a strong effect on resistance, explaining about 21.5%, 12.3% and 39.2% of the resistance variance, respectively. These QTLs were different from the loci of the BB resistance genes that have been identified in previous studies. The QTLs mapped in this work will facilitate the isolation of novel BB resistance genes and their utilization in rice resistance breeding.
24798002	Rice CYP703A3, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase, is essential for development of anther cuticle and pollen exine.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Anther cuticle and pollen exine act as protective envelopes for the male gametophyte or pollen grain, but the mechanism underlying the synthesis of these lipidic polymers remains unclear. Previously, a tapetum-expressed CYP703A3, a putative cytochrome P450 fatty acid hydroxylase, was shown to be essential for male fertility in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, the biochemical and biological roles of CYP703A3 has not been characterized. Here, we observed that cyp703a3-2 caused by one base insertion in CYP703A3 displays defective pollen exine and anther epicuticular layer, which differs from Arabidopsis cyp703a2 in which only defective pollen exine occurs. Consistently, chemical composition assay showed that levels of cutin monomers and wax components were dramatically reduced in cyp703a3-2 anthers. Unlike the wide range of substrates of Arabidopsis CYP703A2, CYP703A3 functions as an in-chain hydroxylase only for a specific substrate, lauric acid, preferably generating 7-hydroxylated lauric acid. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression analyses revealed that the expression of CYP703A3 is directly regulated by Tapetum Degeneration Retardation, a known regulator of tapetum PCD and pollen exine formation. Collectively, our results suggest that CYP703A3 represents a conserved and diversified biochemical pathway for in-chain hydroxylation of lauric acid required for the development of male organ in higher plants.
24996032	Signalling and responses to strigolactones and karrikins.	2014	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Strigolactone (SL) and karrikin (KAR) signalling control many aspects of plant growth and development through similar mechanisms employing related α/β-fold hydrolase-receptors and a common F-box protein named MORE AXILARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) in Arabidopsis or DWARF3 (D3) in rice. D3 mediates SL-dependent ubiquitination and proteolysis of DWARF53 (D53) protein, thought to be involved in the control of gene expression, while a related protein SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-1 (SMAX1) is implicated in the response to KAR in Arabidopsis. Different members of the D53/SMAX1 multigene family likely mediate different responses in plant growth and development. Analysis of responses to SL or KAR has identified many genes regulated by these compounds. Crosstalk with other signalling systems including light, hormones and abiotic stress has also been identified. Here we critically analyse how to progress towards a clearer understanding of the targets and functions of the SL and KAR signalling systems.
25219308	A redox-sensitive cysteine residue regulates the kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro.	2014	Plant Sci	Two subgroup A rice mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, have been implicated in multiple stress responses. However, the redox-control of the kinase activity of these proteins remains unknown. Here, immunoprecipitated OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were initially activated in 15min, and this activation transiently increased in rice seedlings under H2O2 stress. Among the six conserved cysteine residues, only the fourth cysteine residues in the kinase domain VII, Cys(179) and Cys(210), were required for the in vitro kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, respectively. Moreover, the substitution of these specific cysteine residues with serine abrogated in vitro kinase responses to redox conditions. These results suggest a novel redox-control mechanism for the kinase activities of these MAPKs in vivo.
25136671	The role of antioxidant enzymes in adaptive responses to sheath blight infestation under different fertilization rates and hill densities.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	Sheath blight of rice, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. No rice cultivar has been found to be completely resistant to this fungus. Identifying antioxidant enzymes activities (activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)) and malondialdehyde content (MDA) responding to sheath blight infestation is imperative to understand the defensive mechanism systems of rice. In the present study, two inoculation methods (toothpick and agar block method) were tested in double-season rice. Toothpick method had greater lesion length than agar block method in late season. A higher MDA content was found under toothpick method compared with agar block method, which led to greater POD and SOD activities. Dense planting caused higher lesion length resulting in a higher MDA content, which also subsequently stimulated higher POD and SOD activity. Sheath blight severity was significantly related to the activity of antioxidant enzyme during both seasons. The present study implies that rice plants possess a system of antioxidant protective enzymes which helps them in adaptation to sheath blight infection stresses. Several agronomic practices, such as rational use of fertilizers and optimum planting density, involved in regulating antioxidant protective enzyme systems can be regarded as promising strategy to suppress the sheath blight development.
25061741	Comprehensive gene expression analysis of the DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Genet Mol Res	Cytosine DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic regulatory mechanism in both plants and animals. DNA methyltransferases (DNA MTases) not only initiate (de novo) but also maintain the process of DNA methylation. Here, we characterized the genome-wide expression profiles of 10 cytosine DNA MTase genes belonging to 4 subfamilies, MET1, CMT, DNMT2, and DRM, in rice. Tissue-specific gene expression analysis showed that all family members varied widely in their expression and specificities and might be involved in some basic metabolic pathways. Similarly, the expression of all rice cytosine DNA MTase genes was not regulated by plant hormones except OsDRM1a and OsDRM1b, which were downregulated by jasmonic acid. The transcription level of 10 genes in rice shoots and roots was also measured under salt and osmotic stress. Meanwhile, quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the japonica and indica rice cultivars revealed that there is large variation in the expression activities of all genes. The results provide a foundation to further explore the roles of DNA MTases and the epigenetic regulation of abiotic stress responses in rice.
25071811	Ubiquitin-mediated control of seed size in plants.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Seed size in higher plants is an important agronomic trait, and is also crucial for evolutionary fitness. In flowering plants, the seed comprises three major anatomical components, the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat, each with different genetic compositions. Therefore, seed size is coordinately determined by the growth of the embryo, endosperm and maternal tissue. Recent studies have revealed multiple pathways that influence seed size in plants. Several factors involved in ubiquitin-related activities have been recently known to determine seed size in Arabidopsis and rice. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of ubiquitin-mediated control of seed size and discuss the role of the ubiquitin pathway in seed size control.
25096046	Meiotic chromosome structure and function in plants.	2014	Cytogenet Genome Res	Chromosome structure is important for many meiotic processes. Here, we outline 3 main determinants of chromosome structure and their effects on meiotic processes in plants. Cohesins are necessary to hold sister chromatids together until the first meiotic division, ensuring that homologous chromosomes and not sister chromatids separate during anaphase I. During meiosis in maize, Arabidopsis, and rice, cohesins are needed for establishing early prophase chromosome structure and recombination and for aligning bivalents at the metaphase plate. Condensin complexes play pivotal roles in controlling the packaging of chromatin into chromosomes through chromatin compaction and chromosome individualization. In animals and fungi, these complexes establish a meiotic chromosome structure that allows for proper recombination, pairing, and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. In plants, information on the role of condensins in meiosis is limited, but they are known to be required for successful completion of reproductive development. Therefore, we speculate that they play roles similar to animal and fungal condensins during meiosis. Plants generally have large and complex genomes due to frequent polyploidy events, and likely, condensins and cohesins organize chromosomes in such a way as to ensure genome stability. Hexaploid wheat has evolved a unique mechanism using a Ph1 locus-controlled chromosome organization to ensure proper chromosome pairing in meiosis. Altogether, studies on meiotic chromosome structure indicate that chromosome organization is not only important for chromatin packaging but also fulfills specific functions in facilitating chromosome interactions during meiosis, including pairing and recombination.
24870048	Genetic mapping of the rice resistance-breaking gene of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2014	Proc Biol Sci	Host plant resistance has been widely used for controlling the major rice pest brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens). However, adaptation of the wild BPH population to resistance limits the effective use of resistant rice varieties. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted to identify resistance-breaking genes against the anti-feeding mechanism mediated by the rice resistance gene Bph1. QTL analysis in iso-female BPH lines with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers detected a single region on the 10th linkage group responsible for the virulence. The QTL explained from 57 to 84% of the total phenotypic variation. Bulked segregant analysis with next-generation sequencing in F2 progenies identified five SNPs genetically linked to the virulence. These analyses showed that virulence to Bph1 was controlled by a single recessive gene. In contrast to previous studies, the gene-for-gene relationship between the major resistance gene Bph1 and virulence gene of BPH was confirmed. Identified markers are available for map-based cloning of the major gene controlling BPH virulence to rice resistance.
25026554	Protoplast: a more efficient system to study nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation is a powerful tool for plant research, but it can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Here, we report a protoplast-based approach to study nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions, such as cytoplasmic male sterility/fertility restoration (CMS/Rf) and organellar RNA editing. To test the system, we transfected the fertility restorer gene Rf5, which is involved in the rice HL-CMS/Rf system, into rice protoplasts prepared from the HL-CMS line. As the Rf5 protein accumulated in the transformed protoplasts, the CMS-associated transcripts were endonucleolytically cleaved. There were much lower levels of the CMS-associated protein ORFH79 in the transfected protoplasts than in the mock-transfected protoplasts. Next, we used a dsRNA-mediated gene silencing approach to down-regulate the pentatricopeptide protein gene MPR25, which participates in RNA editing of the organellar transcript nad5. The editing efficiency of mitochondrial transcripts of nad5 at nucleotide 1580 was much lower in the transfected protoplasts than in the mock-transfected protoplasts. Together, these results show that protoplast is a simple and efficient system to study interactions between the nucleus and organelles.
25320465	Screening of rice landraces for salinity tolerance at seedling stage through morphological and molecular markers.	2014	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	The present investigation was carried out to evaluate 33 rice landrace genotypes for assessment of their salt tolerance at seedling stage. Growth parameters like root length, shoot length and plant biomass were measured after 12 days of exposure to six different levels of saline solution (with electrical conductivity of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 dS m (-1)). Genotypes showing significant interaction and differential response towards salinity were assessed at molecular level using 11 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, linked with salt tolerance quantitative trait loci. Shoot length, root length and plant biomass at seedling stage decreased with increasing salinity. However, relative salt tolerance in terms of these three parameters varied among genotypes. Out of the 11 SSR markers RM8094, RM336 and RM8046, the most competent descriptors to screen the salt tolerant genotypes with higher polymorphic information content coupled with higher marker index value, significantly distinguished the salt tolerant genotypes. Combining morphological and molecular assessment, four lanraces viz. Gheus, Ghunsi, Kuthiahara and Sholerpona were considered as true salt tolerant genotypes which may contribute in greater way in the development of salt tolerant genotypes in rice.
24987012	The ZmCLA4 gene in the qLA4-1 QTL controls leaf angle in maize (Zea mays L.).	2014	J Exp Bot	Maize architecture is a major contributing factor to their high level of productivity. Maize varieties with an erect-leaf-angle (LA) phenotype, which increases light harvesting for photosynthesis and grain-filling, have elevated grain yields. Although a large body of information is available on the map positions of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for LA, little is known about the molecular mechanism of these QTL. In this study, the ZmCLA4 gene, which is responsible for the qLA4-1 QTL associated with LA, was identified and isolated by fine mapping and positional cloning. The ZmCLA4 gene is an orthologue of LAZY1 in rice and Arabidopsis. Sequence analysis revealed two SNPs and two indel sites in ZmCLA4 between the D132 and D132-NIL inbred maize lines. Association analysis showed that C/T/mutation667 and CA/indel965 were strongly associated with LA. Subcellular localization verified the functions of a predicted transmembrane domain and a nuclear localization signal in ZmCLA4. Transgenic maize plants with a down-regulated ZmCLA4 RNAi construct and transgenic rice plants over-expressing ZmCLA4 confirmed that the ZmCLA4 gene located in the qLA4 QTL regulated LA. The allelic variants of ZmCLA4 in the D132 and D132-NIL lines exhibited significant differences in leaf angle. ZmCLA4 transcript accumulation was higher in D132-NIL than in D132 during all the developmental stages and was negatively correlated with LA. The gravitropic response was increased and cell shape and number at the leaf and stem junctions were altered in D132-NIL relative to D132. These findings suggest that ZmCLA4 plays a negative role in the control of maize LA through the alteration of mRNA accumulation, leading to altered shoot gravitropism and cell development. The cloning of the gene responsible for the qLA4-1 QTL provides information on the molecular mechanisms of LA in maize and an opportunity for the improvement of plant architecture with regard to LA through maize breeding.
24985700	System analysis of microRNAs in the development and aluminium stress responses of the maize root system.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) that down-regulate target genes through mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. miRNA is known to play an important role in the root development and environmental responses in both the Arabidopsis and rice. However, little information is available to form a complete view of miRNAs in the development of the maize root system and Al stress responses in maize. Four sRNA libraries were generated and sequenced from the early developmental stage of primary roots (PRY), the later developmental stage of maize primary roots (PRO), seminal roots (SR) and crown roots (CR). Through integrative analysis, we identified 278 miRNAs (246 conserved and 32 novel ones) and found that the expression patterns of miRNAs differed dramatically in different maize roots. The potential targets of the identified conserved and novel miRNAs were also predicted. In addition, our data showed that CR is more resistant to Al stress compared with PR and SR, and the differentially expressed miRNAs are likely to play significant roles in different roots in response to environmental stress such as Al stress. Here, we demonstrate that the expression patterns of miRNAs are highly diversified in different maize roots. The differentially expressed miRNAs are correlated with both the development and environmental responses in the maize root. This study not only improves our knowledge about the roles of miRNAs in maize root development but also reveals the potential role of miRNAs in the environmental responses of different maize roots.
25033935	WRKY45-dependent priming of diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice and the role of cytokinin in triggering the reaction.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Plant activators such as benzothiadiazole (BTH) protect plants against diseases by priming the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. In rice, the transcription factor WRKY45 plays a central role in this process. To investigate the mechanism involved in defense-priming by BTH and the role of WRKY45 in this process, we analyzed the transcripts of biosynthetic genes for diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs) during the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae interaction. The DP biosynthetic genes were barely upregulated in BTH-treated rice plants, but were induced rapidly after M. oryzae infection in a WRKY45-dependent manner. These results indicate that the DP biosynthetic genes were primed by BTH through WRKY45. Rapid induction of the DP biosynthetic genes was also observed after M. oryzae infection to WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) plants. The changes in gene transcription resulted in accumulation of DPs in WRKY45-ox and BTH-pretreated rice after M. oryzae infection. Previously, we reported that cytokinins (CKs), especially isopentenyladenines, accumulated in M. oryzae-infected rice. Here, we show that DP biosynthetic genes are regulated by the SA/CK synergism in a WRKY45-dependent manner. Together, we propose that CK plays a role in mediating the signal of M. oryzae infection to trigger the induction of DP biosynthetic genes in BTH-primed plants.
25034643	Identification and independent validation of a stable yield and thousand grain weight QTL on chromosome 6A of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Grain yield in wheat is a polygenic trait that is influenced by environmental and genetic interactions at all stages of the plant's growth. Yield is usually broken down into three components; number of spikes per area, grain number per spike, and grain weight (TGW). In polyploid wheat, studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) which affect TGW, yet few have been validated and fine-mapped using independent germplasm, thereby having limited impact in breeding.

RESULTS: In this study we identified a major QTL for TGW, yield and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6A of the Spark x Rialto population, across 12 North European environments. Using independent germplasm in the form of BC2 and BC4 near isogenic lines (NILs), we validated the three QTL effects across environments. In four of the five experiments the Rialto 6A introgression gave significant improvements in yield (5.5%) and TGW (5.1%), with morphometric measurements showing that the increased grain weight was a result of wider grains. The extended green canopy duration associated with the high yielding/TGW Rialto allele was comprised of two independent effects; earlier flowering and delayed final maturity, and was expressed stably across the five environments. The wheat homologue (TaGW2) of a rice gene associated with increased TGW and grain width was mapped within the QTL interval. However, no polymorphisms were identified in the coding sequence between the parents.

CONCLUSION: The discovery and validation through near-isogenic lines of robust QTL which affect yield, green canopy duration, thousand grain weight, and grain width on chromosome 6A of hexaploid wheat provide an important first step to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating the complex processes governing grain size and yield in polyploid wheat.
25023387	Investigating the response of tropical maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars against elevated levels of O3 at two developmental stages.	2014	Ecotoxicology	Tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations are rising in Indo-Gangetic plains of India, causing potential threat to agricultural productivity. Maize (Zea mays L.) is the third most important staple crop at global level after rice and wheat. Two high yielding cultivars of Indian maize (HQPM1-quality protein maize and DHM117-normal/non quality protein maize) were exposed to two levels of elevated O3 above the ambient level (NFC) viz. NFC + 15 ppb O3 (NFC + 15) and NFC + 30 ppb O3 (NFC + 30) using open top chambers under field conditions. The study was conducted to evaluate the biochemical responses of two cultivars at different developmental stages leading to change in yield responses. Initially at lower O3 dose, photosynthetic pigments showed an increase but reduction at later stage, while higher dose caused a decline at both the stages of sampling. Levels of superoxide radical (O2 (-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly increased and contributed to lipid peroxidation at elevated O3. Histochemical localization assay of O2 (-) and H2O2 showed that guard cells of stomata and cells around trichomes took deeper stain at elevated O3 reflecting more formation of reactive oxygen species. Secondary metabolites like total phenol, flavonoids and anthocyanin pigments also increased in plants under O3 stress. Enzymatic antioxidants were triggered in both the cultivars due to elevated O3, while induction of non-enzymatic antioxidants was more in HQPM1. Native PAGE analysis also showed that SOD, POX, CAT, APX and GPX were stimulated at elevated O3 concentrations compared to NFC. SDS-PAGE showed reductions of major photosynthetic proteins with higher decrease in DHM117. Principal Component Analysis showed that both the cultivars showed differential response against O3 at two developmental stages. HQPM1 maintained the analogous defense strategy at both the sampling stages while DHM117 showed variable response. Overall metabolic induction of antioxidants related to defense was more in DHM117 than HQPM1. This suggests that DHM117 utilized more assimilates in maintaining the homeostasis against imposed oxidative stress, causing less translocation of assimilates to reproductive parts and thus affecting the final yield. In terms of yield it is suggested that performance of HQPM1 (quality protein maize) was better than the DHM117 (non quality protein maize).
25055794	Expression analysis of rice pathogenesis-related proteins involved in stress response and endophytic colonization properties of gfp-tagged Bacillus subtilis CB-R05.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Bacillus subtilis CB-R05, possessing antagonistic effects against several fungal pathogens, is a diazotrophic plant growth-promoting bacteria marked with the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene. To confirm the expression level of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in rice inoculated with CB-R05, the expressions of four pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (PR2, PR6, PR15, and PR16) were examined in the rice leaves treated with wounding stress over a time period. The PR proteins were generally more strongly expressed in the rice leaves inoculated with CB-R05 compared with the untreated control. The marked gfp-tagged B. subtilis CB-R05 strain was inoculated onto the rice seedlings under axenic conditions. Under the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), the gfp-tagged CB-R05 bacterial cells were observed to penetrate the rhizoplane, especially in the elongation and differentiation zones of the rice roots, and colonize the root intracellularly. The bacteria, 24 h after the gfp-tagged CB-R05 inoculation, were seen to penetrate into the cell wall, cortex, xylem, and concentrate mainly in the vascular bundle. Numerous bacteria were observed within the intercellular spaces, root cortical cells, and xylem vessels. Over time, these bacteria dispersed to the lateral root junctions and propagated slowly from the roots to the stems and leaves. The B. subtilis CB-R05 population in the rice root rhizosphere was also monitored. These results show a very widespread colonization of the B. subtilis CB-R05 in the rice rhizosphere. Further attempts are under way to investigate the competition between the CB-R05 bacteria and the fungal pathogen in vivo.
25064847	Contrasting effects of ethylene biosynthesis on induced plant resistance against a chewing and a piercing-sucking herbivore in rice.	2014	Mol Plant	Ethylene is a stress hormone with contrasting effects on herbivore resistance. However, it remains unknown whether these differences are plant- or herbivore-specific. We cloned a rice 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase gene, OsACS2, whose transcripts were rapidly up-regulated in response to mechanical wounding and infestation by two important pests: the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens. Antisense expression of OsACS2 (as-acs) reduced elicited ethylene emission, SSB-elicited trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) activity, SSB-induced volatile release, and SSB resistance. Exogenous application of ACC restored TrypPI activity and SSB resistance. In contrast to SSB, BPH infestation increased volatile emission in as-acs lines. Accordingly, BPH preferred to feed and oviposit on wild-type (WT) plants--an effect that could be attributed to two repellent volatiles, 2-heptanone and 2-heptanol, that were emitted in higher amounts by as-acs plants. BPH honeydew excretion was reduced and natural enemy attraction was enhanced in as-acs lines, resulting in higher overall resistance to BPH. These results demonstrate that ethylene signaling has contrasting, herbivore-specific effects on rice defense responses and resistance against a chewing and a piercing-sucking insect, and may mediate resistance trade-offs between herbivores of different feeding guilds in rice.
25002224	Generation mechanism of novel, huge protein bodies containing wild type or hypoallergenic derivatives of birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 in rice endosperm.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Tree pollen chimera 7 (TPC7), a hypoallergenic Bet v 1 tolerogen against birch pollen allergy, induces the formation of novel, huge protein bodies (referred to as TPC7 bodies) in rice endosperm, and is accumulated in high level. In the present study, we found that native Bet v 1 and TPC9, analog proteins of TPC7, were also deposited into novel protein bodies in rice endosperm. However, the novel protein bodies in Bet v 1 and TPC9 rice were much smaller and less abundant than those in TPC7 rice, reflected in lower amounts of accumulation of Bet v 1 and TPC9 than that of TPC7. A domain swapping experiment between TPC7 and Bet v 1 revealed that the latter half of TPC7 is important for the formation of the TPC7 body. We found that chaperons and folding enzymes such as BiP and protein disulfide isomerase were localized within the TPC7 body. TPC7 protein was extracted from TPC7 seeds as large aggregates with molecular masses greater than 669 kDa, or approximately 75 kDa under native or semi-native conditions. These TPC7 aggregates are thought to be responsible for the induction of TPC7 body formation. TPC7 accumulated to a maximum level of 550 μg/seed, which amounts to 23% of total seed protein, while Bet v 1 and TPC9 accumulated much lower levels. The TPC7 body represents a promising reservoir, which may serve as a fusion partner for high-level production and sequestering storage of recombinant proteins.
24783971	Genome-wide identification, evolution, and expression analysis of RNA-binding glycine-rich protein family in maize.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	The RNA-binding glycine-rich protein (RB-GRP) family is characterized by the presence of a glycine-rich domain arranged in (Gly)n-X repeats and an RNA-recognition motif (RRM). RB-GRPs participate in varied physiological and biochemical processes especially in the stress response of plants. In this study, a total of 23 RB-GRPs distributed on 10 chromosomes were identified in maize (Zea mays L.), and they were divided into four subgroups according to their conserved domain architecture. Five pairs of paralogs were identified, while none of them was located on the same chromosomal region, suggesting that segmental duplication is predominant in the duplication events of the RB-GRPs in maize. Comparative analysis of RB-GRPs in maize, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) revealed that two exclusive subgroups were only identified in maize. Expression of eight ZmRB-GRPs was significantly regulated by at least two kinds of stresses. In addition, cis-elements predicted in the promoter regions of the ZmRB-GRPs also indicated that these ZmRB-GRPs would be involved in stress response of maize. The preliminary genome-wide analysis of the RB-GRPs in maize would provide useful information for further study on the function of the ZmRB-GRPs.
25046853	Protective roles of nitric oxide on seed germination and seedling growth of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under cadmium stress.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Nitric oxide (NO) is a bioactive molecule in plants which mediates a variety of physiological processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses including heavy metals. In the present study, the effects of exogenous NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on rice seed germination and seedlings growth were investigated under Cd stress and a possible mechanism was postulated. The results indicated that 100μM Cd significantly decreased rice seed germination index, vigor index, root and shoot lengths as well as fresh weight compared to control. Exogenous SNP dose-dependently attenuated the inhibition of rice seed germination and thereafter seedling growth caused by Cd. The promoting effect was most pronounced at 30μM SNP. Cd exposure caused oxidative stress by elevating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in root and shoot of rice seedlings. 30μM SNP counteracted partly Cd toxicity by reducing the H2O2 and MDA contents of Cd-exposed seedlings. Meanwhile, application of SNP markedly stimulated the activities of superoxide dismutases (SOD), ascorbate peroxidases (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (POD) and catalases (CAT) compared with Cd treatment alone, thereby indicating the enhancement of the antioxidative capacity in the root and shoot under Cd stress. In addition, addition of 30μM SNP increased accumulation of proline in both root and shoot. The Cd accumulation in seedlings was significant reduced by SNP, implicating that the protective role of SNP was responsible for preventing Cd accumulation. However, the effects of SNP were reverted by addition of cPTIO, a NO scavenger, suggesting the protective roles of SNP might be related to the induction of NO. Furthermore, K3Fe(CN)6 and [Formula: see text] / [Formula: see text] had no similar roles as SNP. Based on these results, it can be concluded that SNP exerted an advantageous effect on alleviating the inhibitory effect of Cd on rice seed germination and seedling growth, which might interact with NO.
24985886	Selenium ameliorates arsenic induced oxidative stress through modulation of antioxidant enzymes and thiols in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Ecotoxicology	Arsenic (As) contamination of rice is a major problem for South-East Asia. In the present study, the effect of selenium (Se) on rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants exposed to As was studied in hydroponic culture. Arsenic accumulation, plant growth, thiolic ligands and antioxidative enzyme activities were assayed after single (As and Se) and simultaneous supplementations (As + Se). The results indicated that the presence of Se (25 µM) decreased As accumulation by threefold in roots and twofold in shoots as compared to single As (25 µM) exposed plants. Arsenic induced oxidative stress in roots and shoots was significantly ameliorated by Se supplementation. The observed positive response was found associated with the increased activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11), catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9) and induced levels of non-protein thiols (NPTs), glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs) in As + Se exposed plants as compared to single As treatment. Selenium supplementation modulated the thiol metabolism enzymes viz., γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS; EC 6.3.2.2), glutathione-S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) and phytochelatin synthase (PCS; EC 2.3.2.15). Gene expression analysis of several metalloid responsive genes (LOX, SOD and MATE) showed upregulation during As stress, however, significant downregulation during As + Se exposure as compared to single As treatment. Gene expressions of enzymes of antioxidant and GSH and PC biosynthetic systems, such as APX, CAT, GPx, γ-ECS and PCS were found to be significantly positively correlated with their enzyme activities. The findings suggested that Se supplementation could be an effective strategy to reduce As accumulation and toxicity in rice plants.
25067834	Transgenic cry1C or cry2A rice has no adverse impacts on the life-table parameters and population dynamics of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2015	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Transgenic rice producing the insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) is protected from damage by lepidopteran insect pests. However, one of the main concerns about Bt rice is the potential impact on non-target herbivores. In the present study, the ecological impacts of two Bt rice lines, T1C-19 expressing Cry1C protein and T2A-1 expressing Cry2A protein, on the non-target herbivore brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), were evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. The purpose was to verify whether these Bt rice lines could affect the performance of BPH at individual and population scales.

RESULTS: Laboratory results showed that most of the fitness parameters (development duration, survival rate, fecundity, fertility, amount of honeydew excreted) of BPH were not significantly affected by the two tested Bt rice lines, although the development duration of fourth-instar nymphs fed on T1C-19 was distinctly longer compared with that on T2A-1 and non-Bt rice plants. Five life-table parameters did not significantly differ among rice types. Two-year field trials also revealed no significant difference in population dynamics of BPH among rice types.

CONCLUSION: It is inferred that the tested Bt rice lines are unlikely to affect the population growth of BPH.
25056418	Genomic profiling of rice roots with short- and long-term chromium stress.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Cr(VI) is the most toxic valency form of Cr, but its toxicity targets and the cellular systems contributing to acquisition of tolerance remain to be resolved at the molecular level in plants. We used microarray assay to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of rice roots in response to Cr(VI) stress. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the 2,688 Cr-responsive genes were involved in binding activity, metabolic process, biological regulation, cellular process and catalytic activity. More transcripts were responsive to Cr(VI) during long-term exposure (24 h, 2,097 genes), than short-term exposure (1- and 3-h results pooled, 1,181 genes). Long-term Cr(VI)-regulated genes are involved in cytokinin signaling, the ubiquitin-proteasome system pathway, DNA repair and Cu transportation. The expression of AS2 transcription factors was specifically modulated by long-term Cr(VI) stress. The protein kinases receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase and receptor-like kinase in flowers 3 were significantly upregulated with only short-term Cr(VI) exposure. In addition, 4 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases, 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 1 calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) were upregulated with short-term Cr(VI) treatment. Expression of reactive oxygen species and calcium and activity of MAPKs and CDPK-like kinases were induced with increasing Cr(VI) concentration. These results may provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms of Cr toxicity and tolerance during different stages in rice roots.
25040350	The regulatory network mediated by circadian clock genes is related to heterosis in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Exploitation of heterosis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) has contributed greatly to global food security. In this study, we generated three sets of reciprocal F1 hybrids of indica and japonica subspecies to evaluate the relationship between yield heterosis and the circadian clock. There were no differences in trait performance or heterosis between the reciprocal hybrids, indicating no maternal effects on heterosis. The indica-indica and indica-japonica reciprocal F1 hybrids exhibited pronounced heterosis for chlorophyll and starch content in leaves and for grain yield/biomass. In contrast, the japonica-japonica F1 hybrids showed low heterosis. The three circadian clock genes investigated expressed in an above-high-parent pattern (AHP) at seedling stage in all the hybrids. The five genes downstream of the circadian clock, and involved in chlorophyll and starch metabolic pathways, were expressed in AHP in hybrids with strong better-parent heterosis (BPH). Similarly, three of these five genes in the japonica-japonica F1 hybrids showing low BPH were expressed in positive overdominance, but the other two genes were expressed in additive or negative overdominance. These results indicated that the expression patterns of circadian clock genes and their downstream genes are associated with heterosis, which suggests that the circadian rhythm pathway may be related to heterosis in rice.
25003197	Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing a grass PpEXP1 gene exhibit enhanced tolerance to heat stress.	2014	PLoS One	Heat stress is a detrimental abiotic stress limiting the growth of many plant species and is associated with various cellular and physiological damages. Expansins are a family of proteins which are known to play roles in regulating cell wall elongation and expansion, as well as other growth and developmental processes. The in vitro roles of expansins regulating plant heat tolerance are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to isolate and clone an expansin gene in a perennial grass species (Poa pratensis) and to determine whether over-expression of expansin may improve plant heat tolerance. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was used as the model plant for gene transformation and an expansin gene PpEXP1 from Poa pratensis was cloned. Sequence analysis showed PpEXP1 belonged to α-expansins and was closely related to two expansin genes in other perennial grass species (Festuca pratensis and Agrostis stolonifera) as well as Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa, and Brachypodium distachyon. Transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing PpEXP1 were generated through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Under heat stress (42°C) in growth chambers, transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing the PpEXP1 gene exhibited a less structural damage to cells, lower electrolyte leakage, lower levels of membrane lipid peroxidation, and lower content of hydrogen peroxide, as well as higher chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, relative water content, activity of antioxidant enzyme, and seed germination rates, compared to the wild-type plants. These results demonstrated the positive roles of PpEXP1 in enhancing plant tolerance to heat stress and the possibility of using expansins for genetic modification of cool-season perennial grasses in the development of heat-tolerant germplasm and cultivars.
25040333	Contribution of the drought tolerance-related stress-responsive NAC1 transcription factor to resistance of barley to Ramularia leaf spot.	2015	Mol Plant Pathol	NAC proteins are plant transcription factors that are involved in tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, as well as in many developmental processes. Stress-responsive NAC1 (SNAC1) transcription factor is involved in drought tolerance in barley and rice, but has not been shown previously to have a role in disease resistance. Transgenic over-expression of HvSNAC1 in barley cv. Golden Promise reduced the severity of Ramularia leaf spot (RLS), caused by the fungus Ramularia collo-cygni, but had no effect on disease symptoms caused by Fusarium culmorum, Oculimacula yallundae (eyespot), Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (powdery mildew) or Magnaporthe oryzae (blast). The HvSNAC1 transcript was weakly induced in the RLS-susceptible cv. Golden Promise during the latter stages of R. collo-cygni symptom development when infected leaves were senescing. Potential mechanisms controlling HvSNAC1-mediated resistance to RLS were investigated. Gene expression analysis revealed no difference in the constitutive levels of antioxidant transcripts in either of the over-expression lines compared with cv. Golden Promise, nor was any difference in stomatal conductance or sensitivity to reactive oxygen species-induced cell death observed. Over-expression of HvSNAC1 delayed dark-induced leaf senescence. It is proposed that mechanisms controlled by HvSNAC1 that are involved in tolerance to abiotic stress and that inhibit senescence also confer resistance to R. collo-cygni and suppress RLS symptoms. This provides further evidence for an association between abiotic stress and senescence in barley and the development of RLS.
25048298	Heterologous expression of Ceratophyllum demersum phytochelatin synthase, CdPCS1, in rice leads to lower arsenic accumulation in grain.	2014	Sci Rep	Recent studies have identified rice (Oryza sativa) as a major dietary source of inorganic arsenic (As) and poses a significant human health risk. The predominant model for plant detoxification of heavy metals is complexation of heavy metals with phytochelatins (PCs), synthesized non-translationally by PC synthase (PCS) and compartmentalized in vacuoles. In this study, in order to restrict As in the rice roots as a detoxification mechanism, a transgenic approach has been followed through expression of phytochelatin synthase, CdPCS1, from Ceratophyllum demersum, an aquatic As-accumulator plant. CdPCS1 expressing rice transgenic lines showed marked increase in PCS activity and enhanced synthesis of PCs in comparison to non-transgenic plant. Transgenic lines showed enhanced accumulation of As in root and shoot. This enhanced metal accumulation potential of transgenic lines was positively correlated to the content of PCs, which also increased several-fold higher in transgenic lines. However, all the transgenic lines accumulated significantly lower As in grain and husk in comparison to non-transgenic plant. The higher level of PCs in transgenic plants relative to non-transgenic presumably allowed sequestering and detoxification of higher amounts of As in roots and shoots, thereby restricting its accumulation in grain.
25047236	Gluten quality of bread wheat is associated with activity of RabD GTPases.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	In the developing endosperm of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), seed storage proteins are produced on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to protein bodies, specialized vacuoles for the storage of protein. The functionally important gluten proteins of wheat are transported by two distinct routes to the protein bodies where they are stored: vesicles that bud directly off the ER and transport through the Golgi. However, little is known about the processing of glutenin and gliadin proteins during these steps or the possible impact on their properties. In plants, the RabD GTPases mediate ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Available sequence information for Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and bread wheat was compiled and compared to identify wheat RabD orthologs. Partial genetic sequences were assembled using the first draft of the Chinese Spring wheat genome. A suitable candidate gene from the RabD clade (TaRabD2a) was chosen for down-regulation by RNA interference (RNAi), and an RNAi construct was used to transform wheat plants. All four available RabD genes were shown by qRT-PCR to be down-regulated in the transgenic developing endosperm. The transgenic grain was found to produce flour with significantly altered processing properties when measured by farinograph and extensograph. SE-HPLC found that a smaller proportion of HMW-GS and large proportion of LMW-GS are incorporated into the glutenin macropolymer in the transgenic dough. Lower protein content but a similar protein profile on SDS-PAGE was seen in the transgenic grain.
24320720	Physiological and molecular characterization of Si uptake in wild rice species.	2014	Physiol Plant	Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates high concentration of silicon (Si), which is required for its high and sustainable production. High Si accumulation in cultivated rice is achieved by a high expression of both influx (Lsi1) and efflux (Lsi2) Si transporters in roots. Herein, we physiologically investigated Si uptake, isolated and functionally characterized Si transporters in six wild rice species with different genome types. Si uptake by the roots was lower in Oryza rufipogon, Oryza barthii (AA genome), Oryza australiensis (EE genome) and Oryza punctata (BB genome), but similar in Oryza glumaepatula and Oryza meridionalis (AA genome) compared with the cultivated rice (cv. Nipponbare). However, all wild rice species and the cultivated rice showed similar concentration of Si in the shoots when grown in a field. All species with AA genome showed the same amino acid sequence of both Lsi1 and Lsi2 as O. sativa, whereas species with EE and BB genome showed several nucleotide differences in both Lsi1 and Lsi2. However, proteins encoded by these genes also showed transport activity for Si in Xenopus oocyte. The mRNA expression of Lsi1 in all wild rice species was lower than that in the cultivated rice, whereas the expression of Lsi2 was lower in O. rufipogon and O. barthii but similar in other species. Similar cellular localization of Lsi1 and Lsi2 was observed in all wild rice as the cultivated rice. These results indicate that superior Si uptake, the important trait for rice growth, is basically conserved in wild and cultivated rice species.
25061821	POLYAMINE OXIDASE 1 from rice (Oryza sativa) is a functional ortholog of Arabidopsis POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	POLYAMINE OXIDASE 1 (OsPAO1), from rice (Oryza sativa), and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 (AtPAO5), from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), are enzymes sharing high identity at the amino acid level and with similar characteristics, such as polyamine specificity and pH preference; furthermore, both proteins localize to the cytosol. A loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant, Atpao5-2, was hypersensitive to low doses of exogenous thermospermine but this phenotype could be rescued by introduction of the wild-type AtPAO5 gene. Introduction of OsPAO1, under the control of a constitutive promoter, into Atpao5-2 mutants also restored normal thermospermine sensitivity, allowing growth in the presence of low levels of thermospermine, along with a concomitant decrease in thermospermine content in plants. By contrast, introduction of OsPAO3, which encodes a peroxisome-localized polyamine oxidase, into Atpao5-2 plants could not rescue any of the mutant phenotypes in the presence of thermospermine. These results suggest that OsPAO1 is the functional ortholog of AtPAO5.
25110688	Expression profiling of abiotic stress-inducible genes in response to multiple stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties with contrasting level of stress tolerance.	2014	Biomed Res Int	The present study considered transcriptional profiles and protein expression analyses from shoot and/or root tissues under three abiotic stress conditions, namely, salinity, dehydration, and cold, as well as following exogenous abscisic acid treatment, at different time points of stress exposure in three indica rice varieties, IR-29 (salt sensitive), Pokkali, and Nonabokra (both salt tolerant). The candidate genes chosen for expression studies were HKT-1, SOS-3, NHX-1, SAPK5, SAPK7, NAC-1, Rab16A, OSBZ8, DREBP2, CRT/DREBP, WRKY24, and WRKY71, along with the candidate proteins OSBZ8, SAMDC, and GST. Gene expression profile revealed considerable differences between the salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice varieties, as the expression in the latter was higher even at the constitutive level, whereas it was inducible only by corresponding stress signals in IR-29. Whether in roots or shoots, the transcriptional responses to different stressors peaked following 24 h of stress/ABA exposure, and the transcript levels enhanced gradually with the period of exposure. The generality of stress responses at the transcriptional level was therefore time dependent. Heat map data also showed differential transcript abundance in the three varieties, correlating the observation with transcript profiling. In silico analysis of the upstream regions of all the genes represented the existence of conserved sequence motifs in single or multiple copies that are indispensable to abiotic stress response. Overall, the transcriptome and proteome analysis undertaken in the present study indicated that genes/proteins conferring tolerance, belonging to different functional classes, were overrepresented, thus providing novel insight into the functional basis of multiple stress tolerance in indica rice varieties. The present work will pave the way in future to select gene(s) for overexpression, so as to generate broad spectrum resistance to multiple stresses simultaneously.
25026190	Multiplex event-specific qualitative polymerase chain reaction for detecting three transgenic rice lines and application of a standard plasmid as a quantitative reference molecule.	2014	Anal Biochem	The three most well-known genetically modified (GM) rice lines in China are TT51-1, KMD1, and KF6. The purposes of this study were to establish a multiplex event-specific qualitative polymerase chain reaction (meqPCR) system for simultaneous detection of the three transgenic rice events and to construct a plasmid as the reference molecule for quantitative analysis. Event-specific primers for each event were selected or designed by focusing on the transgene borders between the inserted DNA and the flanking rice DNA. The developed meqPCR was anticipated to detect distinct amplicons as 454, 398, 301, and 250bp from KF6, KMD1, TT51-1, and the rice endogenous reference gene, respectively. The robustness of the meqPCR was tested with different levels of the three transgenic rice genomic DNAs, and the sensitivity threshold of the meqPCR was at least 50ng of 0.1% rice DNA for each event when the three transgenic rice events present and with other GM materials together. The constructed plasmid was evaluated using mixed samples with known GM contents in real-time quantitative PCR. The results indicated that the constructed plasmid was acceptable and suitable for GM rice quantitative analysis.
25024433	The NB-LRR proteins RGA4 and RGA5 interact functionally and physically to confer disease resistance.	2014	EMBO J	Plant resistance proteins of the class of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain proteins (NB-LRRs) are immune sensors which recognize pathogen-derived molecules termed avirulence (AVR) proteins. We show that RGA4 and RGA5, two NB-LRRs from rice, interact functionally and physically to mediate resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and accomplish different functions in AVR recognition. RGA4 triggers an AVR-independent cell death that is repressed in the presence of RGA5 in both rice protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon recognition of the pathogen effector AVR-Pia by direct binding to RGA5, repression is relieved and cell death occurs. RGA4 and RGA5 form homo- and hetero-complexes and interact through their coiled-coil domains. Localization studies in rice protoplast suggest that RGA4 and RGA5 localize to the cytosol. Upon recognition of AVR-Pia, neither RGA4 nor RGA5 is re-localized to the nucleus. These results establish a model for the interaction of hetero-pairs of NB-LRRs in plants: RGA4 mediates cell death activation, while RGA5 acts as a repressor of RGA4 and as an AVR receptor.
24905498	The plant glycosyltransferase clone collection for functional genomics.	2014	Plant J	The glycosyltransferases (GTs) are an important and functionally diverse family of enzymes involved in glycan and glycoside biosynthesis. Plants have evolved large families of GTs which undertake the array of glycosylation reactions that occur during plant development and growth. Based on the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) database, the genome of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana codes for over 450 GTs, while the rice genome (Oryza sativa) contains over 600 members. Collectively, GTs from these reference plants can be classified into over 40 distinct GT families. Although these enzymes are involved in many important plant specific processes such as cell-wall and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, few have been functionally characterized. We have sought to develop a plant GTs clone resource that will enable functional genomic approaches to be undertaken by the plant research community. In total, 403 (88%) of CAZy defined Arabidopsis GTs have been cloned, while 96 (15%) of the GTs coded by rice have been cloned. The collection resulted in the update of a number of Arabidopsis GT gene models. The clones represent full-length coding sequences without termination codons and are Gateway® compatible. To demonstrate the utility of this JBEI GT Collection, a set of efficient particle bombardment plasmids (pBullet) was also constructed with markers for the endomembrane. The utility of the pBullet collection was demonstrated by localizing all members of the Arabidopsis GT14 family to the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Updates to these resources are available at the JBEI GT Collection website http://www.addgene.org/.
25062529	Effect of NaCl on ionic content and distribution in suspension-cultured cells of the halophyte Sonneratia alba versus the glycophyte Oryza sativa.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The effect of a high concentration of NaCl on the intra- (cytoplasmic matrix and vacuole) and extracellular (cell wall) distribution of Na, Cl, K, Mg, Ca, S, and P was investigated in suspension-cultured cells of the mangrove halophyte Sonneratia alba and compared to cultured cells of glycophytic rice (Oryza sativa). No significant differences were observed in ultrastructural features of cluster cells of both species cultured with and without 50mM NaCl. Quantitative X-ray microanalysis of cryosections of the cells cultured in the presence of 50mM NaCl showed that the Na concentration ([Na]) and Cl concentration ([Cl]) significantly increased in all three cell components measured. In S. alba, the [Na] was highest in the vacuole and lowest in the cytoplasmic matrix, while the [Cl] was highest in the cell wall and lowest in the cytoplasmic matrix. In O. sativa, however, the [Na] and [Cl] were highest in the cell wall, and the [Na] was lowest in the cytoplasmic matrix. Thus, the possible activities for Na and Cl transport from the cytoplasmic matrix into the vacuole were greater in S. alba than in O. sativa, suggesting that halophilic mangrove cells gain salt tolerance by transporting Na and Cl into their vacuoles. In O. sativa, the addition of NaCl to the culture medium caused no significant changes to the intracellular concentrations of various elements, such as K, P, S, Ca, and Mg, which suggests the absence of a direct relationship with the transport Na and Cl. In contrast, a marked decrease in the Ca concentration ([Ca]) in the cytoplasmic matrix and vacuole and an approximately two-fold increase in the P concentration ([P]) in the cytoplasmic matrix were found in S. alba, suggesting that the decrease in the [Ca] is related to the halophilic nature of S. alba (as indicated by the inward movement of Na(+) and Cl(-)). The possible roles of a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange mechanism in halophilism and the effect of the [P] on the metabolic activity under saline conditions are discussed.
25052585	Differentially expressed microRNA cohorts in seed development may contribute to poor grain filling of inferior spikelets in rice.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The inferior spikelets are defined to be those at portions where the grains receive less photosynthetic products during the seed development. The typical inferior spikelets are physically located on the proximal secondary branches in a rice panicle and traditionally characterized by a later flowering time and a slower grain-filling rate, compared to those so-called superior spikelets. Grains produced on the inferior spikelets are consequently under-developed and lighter in weight than those formed on the superior spikelets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as key players in regulating plant development through post-transcriptional gene regulations. We previously presented the evidence that miRNAs may influence grain-filling rate and played a role in determining the grain weight and yield in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, further analyses of the expressed small RNAs in superior and inferior spikelets were conducted at five distinct developmental stages of grain development. Totally, 457 known miRNAs and 13 novel miRNAs were analyzed, showing a differential expression of 141 known miRNAs between superior and inferior spikelets with higher expression levels of most miRNAs associated with the superior than the inferior spikelets during the early stage of grain filling. Genes targeted by those differentially expressed miRNAs (i.e. miR156, miR164, miR167, miR397, miR1861, and miR1867) were recognized to play roles in multiple developmental and signaling pathways related to plant hormone homeostasis and starch accumulation.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data established a complicated link between miRNA dynamics and the traditional role of hormones in grain filling and development, providing new insights into the widely accepted concepts of the so-called superior and inferior spikelets in rice production.
24988301	Characteristics and expression patterns of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily of foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.).	2014	PLoS One	Recent genomic sequencing of the foxtail millet, an abiotic, stress-tolerant crop, has provided a great opportunity for novel gene discovery and functional analysis of this popularly-grown grass. However, few stress-mediated gene families have been studied. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) comprise a gene superfamily encoding NAD (P) +-dependent enzymes that play the role of "aldehyde scavengers", which indirectly detoxify cellular ROS and reduce the effect of lipid peroxidation meditated cellular toxicity under various environmental stresses. In the current paper, we identified a total of 20 ALDH genes in the foxtail millet genome using a homology search and a phylogenetic analysis and grouped them into ten distinct families based on their amino acid sequence identity. Furthermore, evolutionary analysis of foxtail millet reveals that both tandem and segmental duplication contributed significantly to the expansion of its ALDH genes. The exon-intron structures of members of the same family in foxtail millet or the orthologous genes in rice display highly diverse distributions of their exonic and intronic regions. Also, synteny analysis shows that the majority of foxtail millet and rice ALDH gene homologs exist in the syntenic blocks between the two, implying that these ALDH genes arose before the divergence of cereals. Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative PCR data reveals that a few SiALDH genes are expressed in an organ-specific manner and that the expression of a number of foxtail millet ALDH genes, such as, SiALDH7B1, SiALDH12A1 and SiALDH18B2 are up-regulated by osmotic stress, cold, H2O2, and phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, the transformation of SiALDH2B2, SiALDH10A2, SiALDH5F1, SiALDH22A1, and SiALDH3E2 into Escherichia coli (E.coli) was able to improve their salt tolerance. Taken together, our results show that genome-wide identification characteristics and expression analyses provide unique opportunities for assessing the functional roles of foxtail millet ALDH genes in stress responses.
25063863	Effect of the hope FT-B1 allele on wheat heading time and yield components.	None	J Hered	Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success and, in cereals, to maximize grain yields. Seasonal cues including temperature and day length are integrated to regulate the timing of flowering. In temperate cereals, extended periods of cold (vernalization) release the repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which is upregulated in the leaves in response to inductive long-day photoperiods. FT1 is a homolog of rice HD3a, which encodes a protein transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. A rare FT-B1 allele from the wheat variety "Hope" has been previously shown to be associated with an early flowering phenotype under long-day photoperiods. Here, we demonstrate that the Hope FT-B1 allele accelerates flowering even under short days, and that it is epistatic to the VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) gene. On average, the introgression of Hope FT-B1 into 6 genetic backgrounds resulted in 2.6 days acceleration of flowering (P<0.0001) and 4.1% increase in spike weight (P=0.0093), although in one variety, it was associated with a decrease in spike weight. These results suggest that the Hope FT-B1 allele could be useful in wheat breeding programs to subtly accelerate floral development and increase adaptation to changing environments.
25054628	The spectrum of major seed storage genes and proteins in oats (Avena sativa).	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The oat seed storage proteins are mainly composed of two classes: the globulins and avenins. Among the major cereals, the globulins are the major seed protein class in rice and oats, and along with the higher protein content of oats is the basis for the relative higher nutrition content in oats compared to the other cereals. The second major class of oat seed proteins is the avenins; also classified as prolamins - seed proteins high in proline and glutamine amino acids. The prolamins are associated with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. In spite of their importance, neither the oat globulins nor the avenins have been completely analyzed and described for any single germplasm.

RESULTS: Using available EST resources for a single hexaploid oat cultivar, the spectrum of avenin and globulin sequences are described for the gene coding regions and the derived protein sequences. The nine unique avenin sequences are suggested to be divided into 3-4 distinct subclasses distributed in the hexaploid genome. The globulins from the same germplasm include 24 distinct sequences. Variation in globulin size results mainly from a glutamine-rich domain, similar to as in the avenins, and to variation in the C-terminal sequence domain. Two globulin genes have premature stop codons that shorten the resulting polypeptides by 9 and 17 amino acids, and eight of the globulin sequences form a branch of the globulins not previously reported.

CONCLUSIONS: A more complete description of the major oat seed proteins should allow a more thorough analysis of their contributions to those oat seed characteristics related to nutritional value, evolutionary history, and celiac disease association.
25024277	Growth and physiological adaptation of whole plants and cultured cells from a halophyte turf grass under salt stress.	2014	AoB Plants	Understanding the mechanisms used by halophytic members of the Poaceae to cope with salt stress will contribute to the knowledge necessary to genetically engineer salt-tolerant crops. In this study, we identified a genotype of Sporobolus virginicus, a halophytic turf grass collected in Japan, and investigated its growth rate, ion concentration and secretion, and proline concentration in comparison with the reported properties of genotypes collected from the USA, South Africa and Egypt. Surprisingly, the Japanese genotype showed a salinity tolerance up to 1.5 M NaCl, a 3-fold higher concentration than seawater salinity. Shoot growth was stimulated by 100 mM NaCl and root growth was stimulated at salinities of up to 1 M NaCl. Accumulation of Na(+) and CI(-) in shoots and roots was rapidly elevated by salinity stress but did not exceed the levels required for osmotic adjustment, due in part to ion secretion by salt glands, which are present in genotypes of S. virginicus. However, the Japanese genotypes accumulated K(+) to a higher level than other genotypes, resulting in a relatively high K(+)/Na(+) ratio even under salinity stress. An increase in proline concentration was observed that was proportional to the NaCl concentration in the culture solution and might partially account for osmotic adjustment in the shoots. We also generated and characterized cultured cells of S. virginicus. In 500 mM NaCl, the cultured cells showed an enhanced growth compared with cultured cells of rice. The concentration of Na(+) and CI(-) in the cultured cells in 300-500 mM NaCl was lower than in 100 mM NaCl. Cultured cells of S. virginicus accumulated proline to higher levels than rice cells cultured under salinity stress. The active regulation of Na(+), Cl(-) and K(+) influx/efflux and proline accumulation might be involved in salt tolerance mechanisms at the cellular level as well as in planta.
25006358	Nuclear and chloroplast diversity and phenotypic distribution of rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm from the democratic people's republic of Korea (DPRK; North Korea).	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice accounts for 43% of staple food production in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The most widely planted rice varieties were developed from a limited number of ancestral lines that were repeatedly used as parents in breeding programs. However, detailed pedigrees are not publicly available and little is known about the genetic, phenotypic, and geographical variation of DPRK varieties.

RESULTS: We evaluated 80 O. sativa accessions from the DPRK, consisting of 67 improved varieties and 13 landraces. Based on nuclear SSR analysis, we divide the varieties into two genetic groups: Group 1 corresponds to the temperate japonica subpopulation and represents 78.75% of the accessions, while Group 2 shares recent ancestry with indica varieties. Interestingly, members of Group 1 are less diverse than Group 2 at the nuclear level, but are more diverse at the chloroplast level. All Group 2 varieties share a single Japonica maternal-haplotype, while Group 1 varieties trace maternal ancestry to both Japonica and Indica. Phenotypically, members of Group 1 have shorter grains than Group 2, and varieties from breeding programs have thicker and wider grains than landraces. Improved varieties in Group 1 also show similar and/or better levels of cold tolerance for most traits, except for spikelet number per panicle. Finally, geographic analysis demonstrates that the majority of genetic variation is located within regions that have the most intensive rice cultivation, including the Western territories near the capital city Pyungyang. This is consistent with the conscious and highly centralized role of human selection in determining local dispersion patterns of rice in the DPRK.

CONCLUSIONS: Diversity studies of DPRK rice germplasm revealed two genetic groups. The most widely planted group has a narrow genetic base and would benefit from the introduction of new genetic variation from cold tolerant landraces, wild accessions, and/or cultivated gene pools to enhance yield potential and performance.
24988911	Deep rooting conferred by DEEPER ROOTING 1 enhances rice yield in paddy fields.	2014	Sci Rep	To clarify the effect of deep rooting on grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in an irrigated paddy field with or without fertilizer, we used the shallow-rooting IR64 and the deep-rooting Dro1-NIL (a near-isogenic line homozygous for the Kinandang Patong allele of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) in the IR64 genetic background). Although total root length was similar in both lines, more roots were distributed within the lower soil layer of the paddy field in Dro1-NIL than in IR64, irrespective of fertilizer treatment. At maturity, Dro1-NIL showed approximately 10% higher grain yield than IR64, irrespective of fertilizer treatment. Higher grain yield of Dro1-NIL was mainly due to the increased 1000-kernel weight and increased percentage of ripened grains, which resulted in a higher harvest index. After heading, the uptake of nitrogen from soil and leaf nitrogen concentration were higher in Dro1-NIL than in IR64. At the mid-grain-filling stage, Dro1-NIL maintained higher cytokinin fluxes from roots to shoots than IR64. These results suggest that deep rooting by DRO1 enhances nitrogen uptake and cytokinin fluxes at late stages, resulting in better grain filling in Dro1-NIL in a paddy field in this study.
25071222	Deficiencies in both starch synthase IIIa and branching enzyme IIb lead to a significant increase in amylose in SSIIa-inactive japonica rice seeds.	2014	J Exp Bot	Starch synthase (SS) IIIa has the second highest activity of the total soluble SS activity in developing rice endosperm. Branching enzyme (BE) IIb is the major BE isozyme, and is strongly expressed in developing rice endosperm. A mutant (ss3a/be2b) was generated from wild-type japonica rice which lacks SSIIa activity. The seed weight of ss3a/be2b was 74-94% of that of the wild type, whereas the be2b seed weight was 59-73% of that of the wild type. There were significantly fewer amylopectin short chains [degree of polymerization (DP) ≤13] in ss3a/be2b compared with the wild type. In contrast, the amount of long chains (DP ≥25) connecting clusters of amylopectin in ss3a/be2b was higher than in the wild type and lower than in be2b. The apparent amylose content of ss3a/be2b was 45%, which was >1.5 times greater than that of either ss3a or be2b. Both SSIIIa and BEIIb deficiencies led to higher activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), which partly explains the high amylose content in the ss3a/be2b endosperm. The percentage apparent amylose content of ss3a and ss3a/be2b at 10 days after flowering (DAF) was higher than that of the wild type and be2b. At 20 DAF, amylopectin biosynthesis in be2b and ss3a/be2b was not observed, whereas amylose biosynthesis in these lines was accelerated at 30 DAF. These data suggest that the high amylose content in the ss3a/be2b mutant results from higher amylose biosynthesis at two stages, up to 20 DAF and from 30 DAF to maturity.
25056242	Loss of a 1.6 Mb chromosome in Pyricularia oryzae harboring two alleles of AvrPik leads to acquisition of virulence to rice cultivars containing resistance alleles at the Pik locus.	2014	Curr Genet	A small and extra chromosome of 1.6 Mb was previously identified in a Pyricularia oryzae strain, 84R-62B. To understand a role of the 1.6 Mb chromosome in the pathogenic changeability of P. oryzae, we performed experiments designed to characterize the 1.6 Mb chromosome in the present study. A gene family encoding secreted protein Pex31s in P. oryzae consists of five homologs, Pex31-A to -E. Among them, Pex31-A and -D are known to be recognized by Pik-m and Pik/Pik-m/Pik-p, respectively. In the present study, we identified Pex31-A and -D in the genome of 84R-62B. Segregation analyses using an F1 population between 84R-62B and another rice blast strain, Y93-245c-2, revealed a strong linkage between the two homologs and the 1.6 Mb chromosome of 84R-62B. A CHEF-Southern analysis revealed an association between the 1.6 Mb chromosome and the homologs, indicating that both homologs are located on the 1.6 Mb chromosome of 84R-62B. The loss of the 1.6 Mb chromosome was observed in subcultures of a F1 progeny, F1-327. These subcultures concomitantly acquired virulence on Pik, Pik-m, and Pik-p. The present study is the first report showing that loss of a small and extra chromosome leads to pathogenic mutation of P. oryzae and may provide a new insight into the mechanisms generating pathogenic variation of this fungus.
25016378	Genetic diversity of the conserved motifs of six bacterial leaf blight resistance genes in a set of rice landraces.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by the vascular pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most serious diseases leading to crop failure in rice growing countries. A total of 37 resistance genes against Xoo has been identified in rice. Of these, ten BLB resistance genes have been mapped on rice chromosomes, while 6 have been cloned, sequenced and characterized. Diversity analysis at the resistance gene level of this disease is scanty, and the landraces from West Bengal and North Eastern states of India have received little attention so far. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity at conserved domains of 6 BLB resistance genes in a set of 22 rice accessions including landraces and check genotypes collected from the states of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and West Bengal.

RESULTS: In this study 34 pairs of primers were designed from conserved domains of 6 BLB resistance genes; Xa1, xa5, Xa21, Xa21(A1), Xa26 and Xa27. The designed primer pairs were used to generate PCR based polymorphic DNA profiles to detect and elucidate the genetic diversity of the six genes in the 22 diverse rice accessions of known disease phenotype. A total of 140 alleles were identified including 41 rare and 26 null alleles. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) value was 0.56/primer pair. The DNA profiles identified each of the rice landraces unequivocally. The amplified polymorphic DNA bands were used to calculate genetic similarity of the rice landraces in all possible pair combinations. The similarity among the rice accessions ranged from 18% to 89% and the dendrogram produced from the similarity values was divided into 2 major clusters. The conserved domains identified within the sequenced rare alleles include Leucine-Rich Repeat, BED-type zinc finger domain, sugar transferase domain and the domain of the carbohydrate esterase 4 superfamily.

CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed high genetic diversity at conserved domains of six BLB resistance genes in a set of 22 rice accessions. The inclusion of more genotypes from remote ecological niches and hotspots holds promise for identification of further genetic diversity at the BLB resistance genes.
25076167	Map-based cloning and characterization of a brown planthopper resistance gene BPH26 from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cultivar ADR52.	2014	Sci Rep	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most serious insect pest of rice in Asia. The indica rice cultivar ADR52 carries two BPH resistance genes, BPH26 (brown planthopper resistance 26) and BPH25. Map-based cloning of BPH26 revealed that BPH26 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein. BPH26 mediated sucking inhibition in the phloem sieve element. BPH26 was identical to BPH2 on the basis of DNA sequence analysis and feeding ability of the BPH2-virulent biotype of BPH. BPH2 was widely incorporated in elite rice cultivars and was well-cultivated in many Asian countries as a favorable gene resource in rice breeding against BPH. However, BPH2 was rendered ineffective by a virulent biotype of BPH in rice fields in Asia. In this study, we suggest that BPH2 can be reused by combining with other BPH resistance genes, such as BPH25, to ensure durable resistance to BPH.
25059596	Comparative mapping in the Poaceae family reveals translocations in the complex polyploid genome of sugarcane.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The understanding of sugarcane genetics has lagged behind that of other members of the Poaceae family such as wheat, rice, barley and sorghum mainly due to the complexity, size and polyploidization of the genome. We have used the genetic map of a sugarcane cultivar to generate a consensus genetic map to increase genome coverage for comparison to the sorghum genome. We have utilized the recently developed sugarcane DArT array to increase the marker density within the genetic map. The sequence of these DArT markers plus SNP and EST-SSR markers was then used to form a bridge to the sorghum genomic sequence by BLAST alignment to start to unravel the complex genomic architecture of sugarcane.

RESULTS: Comparative mapping revealed that certain sugarcane chromosomes show greater levels of synteny to sorghum than others. On a macrosyntenic level a good collinearity was observed between sugarcane and sorghum for 4 of the 8 homology groups (HGs). These 4 HGs were syntenic to four sorghum chromosomes with from 98% to 100% of these chromosomes covered by these linked markers. Four major chromosome rearrangements were identified between the other four sugarcane HGs and sorghum, two of which were condensations of chromosomes reducing the basic chromosome number of sugarcane from x = 10 to x = 8. This macro level of synteny was transferred to other members within the Poaceae family such as maize to uncover the important evolutionary relationships that exist between sugarcane and these species.

CONCLUSIONS: Comparative mapping of sugarcane to the sorghum genome has revealed new information on the genome structure of sugarcane which will help guide identification of important genes for use in sugarcane breeding. Furthermore of the four major chromosome rearrangements identified in this study, three were common to maize providing some evidence that chromosome reduction from a common paleo-ancestor of both maize and sugarcane was driven by the same translocation events seen in both species.
24987959	Utilization of stiff culm trait of rice smos1 mutant for increased lodging resistance.	2014	PLoS One	Although the introduction of semi-dwarf trait into rice has led to improved lodging resistance making it capable of supporting high grain yield, lodging still remains a concern when attempting to further increase the grain yield of rice. However, improving the lodging resistance in rice by depending on the semi-dwarf trait alone is possible only up to a certain limit, beyond which other traits may be needed for reinforcement. To search for alternative traits relating to high lodging resistance, we identified 9 rice mutant lines possessing improved culm strength. To evaluate whether such lines can be useful for breeding lodging resistant rice, small organ size1 (smos1) mutant having increased lodging resistance but low tiller number and low grain yield, was chosen as a representative for a breeding trial. smos1 was crossed with ST-4 (from the Stock rice collection of Nagoya University Togo field #4), a cultivar with high tiller number and high grain yield, and from their progeny, LRC1 (lodging resistance candidate-1) was selected. Although the low tiller number trait of smos1 was not fully reversed in LRC1, this was compensated by an increase in grain weight per panicle, thereby resulting in high grain yield per plant. This important attribute of LRC1 was further enhanced by the improved lodging resistance trait inherited from smos1. Such improved lodging resistance in LRC1 and smos1 was revealed to be mainly due to increased culm diameter and culm thickness, which led to a high section modulus (SM) value, a parameter defining the physical strength of the culm. Since smos1 possesses high breaking-type lodging resistance which is different from semi-dwarf plants with high bending-type lodging resistance, an alternative approach of using thick culm lines for the creation of rice with increased lodging resistance is hereby proposed.
24989432	Suppression of collagen-induced arthritis by oral administration of transgenic rice seeds expressing altered peptide ligands of type II collagen.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with the recognition of self proteins secluded in arthritic joints. We previously reported that altered peptide ligands (APLs) of type II collagen (CII256-271) suppress the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In this study, we generated transgenic rice expressing CII256-271 and APL6 contained in fusion proteins with the rice storage protein glutelin in the seed endosperm. These transgene products successfully and stably accumulated at high levels (7-24 mg/g seeds) in protein storage vacuoles (PB-II) of mature seeds. We examined the efficacy of these transgenic rice seeds by performing oral administration of the seeds to CIA model mice that had been immunized with CII. Treatment with APL6 transgenic rice for 14 days significantly inhibited the development of arthritis (based on clinical score) and delayed disease onset during the early phase of arthritis. These effects were mediated by the induction of IL-10 from CD4(+ ) CD25(-) T cells against CII antigen in splenocytes and inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs), and treatment of APL had no effect on the production of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-2 or Foxp3(+) Treg cells. These findings suggest that abnormal immune suppressive mechanisms are involved in the therapeutic effect of rice-based oral vaccine expressing high levels of APLs of type II collagen on the autoimmune disease CIA, suggesting that the seed-based mucosal vaccine against CIA functions via a unique mechanism.
25095703	Dynamic development of starch granules and the regulation of starch biosynthesis in Brachypodium distachyon: comparison with common wheat and Aegilops peregrina.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Thorough understanding of seed starch biosynthesis and accumulation mechanisms is of great importance for agriculture and crop improvement strategies. We conducted the first comprehensive study of the dynamic development of starch granules and the regulation of starch biosynthesis in Brachypodium distachyon and compared the findings with those reported for common wheat (Chinese Spring, CS) and Aegilops peregrina.

RESULTS: Only B-granules were identified in Brachypodium Bd21, and the shape variation and development of starch granules were similar in the B-granules of CS and Bd21. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the Bd21 starch synthesis-related genes were more similar to those in wheat than in rice. Early expression of key genes in Bd21 starch biosynthesis mediate starch synthesis in the pericarp; intermediate-stage expression increases the number and size of starch granules. In contrast, these enzymes in CS and Ae. peregrina were mostly expressed at intermediate stages, driving production of new B-granules and increasing the granule size, respectively. Immunogold labeling showed that granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI; related to amylose synthesis) was mainly present in starch granules: at lower levels in the B-granules of Bd21 than in CS. Furthermore, GBSSI was phosphorylated at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 in the starch synthase catalytic domain in CS and Ae. peregrina, but neither site was phosphorylated in Bd21, suggesting GBSSI phosphorylation could improve amylose biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS: Bd21 contains only B-granules, and the expression of key genes in the three studied genera is consistent with the dynamic development of starch granules. GBSSI is present in greater amounts in the B-granules of CS than in Bd21; two phosphorylation sites (Thr183 and Tyr185) were found in Triticum and Aegilops; these sites were not phosphorylated in Bd21. GBSSI phosphorylation may reflect its importance in amylose synthesis.
25041515	RCN1/OsABCG5, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, is required for hypodermal suberization of roots in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Plant J	Suberin is a complex polymer composed of aliphatic and phenolic compounds. It is a constituent of apoplastic plant interfaces. In many plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), the hypodermis in the outer part of roots forms a suberized cell wall (the Casparian strip and/or suberin lamellae), which inhibits the flow of water and ions and protects against pathogens. To date, there is no genetic evidence that suberin forms an apoplastic transport barrier in the hypodermis. We discovered that a rice reduced culm number1 (rcn1) mutant could not develop roots longer than 100 mm in waterlogged soil. The mutated gene encoded an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter named RCN1/OsABCG5. RCN1/OsABCG5 gene expression in the wild type was increased in most hypodermal and some endodermal roots cells under stagnant deoxygenated conditions. A GFP-RCN1/OsABCG5 fusion protein localized at the plasma membrane of the wild type. Under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, well suberized hypodermis developed in wild types but not in rcn1 mutants. Under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, apoplastic tracers (periodic acid and berberine) were blocked at the hypodermis in the wild type but not in rcn1, indicating that the apoplastic barrier in the mutant was impaired. The amount of the major aliphatic suberin monomers originating from C(28) and C(30) fatty acids or ω-OH fatty acids was much lower in rcn1 than in the wild type. These findings suggest that RCN1/OsABCG5 has a role in the suberization of the hypodermis of rice roots, which contributes to formation of the apoplastic barrier.
25099285	Over-expression of the MxIRT1 gene increases iron and zinc content in rice seeds.	2015	Transgenic Res	Iron and zinc are essential in plant and human nutrition. Iron deficiency has been one of the causes of human mortality, especially in developing countries with high rice consumption. MxIRT1 is a ferrous transporter that has been screened from an iron-efficient genotype of the apple tree, Malus xiaojinensis Cheng et Jiang. In order to produce Fe-biofortified rice with MxIRT1 to solve the Fe-deficiency problem, plant expression vectors of pCAMBIA1302-MxIRT1:GFP and pCAMBIA1302-anti MxIRT1:GFP were constructed that led to successful production of transgenic rice. The transgenic plant phenotypes showed that the expression of endogenous OsIRT1 was suppressed by anti-MxIRT1 in antisense lines that acted as an opposing control, while sense lines had a higher tolerance under Zn- and Fe-deficient conditions. The iron and zinc concentration in T3 seeds increased by three times in sense lines when compared to the wild type. To understand the MxIRT1 cadmium uptake, the MxIRT1 cadmium absorption trait was compared with AtIRT1 and OsIRT1 in transgenic rice protoplasts, and it was found that MxIRT1 had the lowest Cd uptake capacity. MxIRT1 transgenic tobacco-cultured bright yellow-2 (BY-2) cells and rice lines were subjected to different Fe conditions and the results from the non-invasive micro-test technique showed that iron was actively transported compared to cadmium as long as iron was readily available in the environment. This suggests that MxIRT1 is a good candidate gene for plant Fe and Zn biofortification.
25103896	Understanding the genetic and epigenetic architecture in complex network of rice flowering pathways.	2014	Protein Cell	Although the molecular basis of flowering time control is well dissected in the long day (LD) plant Arabidopsis, it is still largely unknown in the short day (SD) plant rice. Rice flowering time (heading date) is an important agronomic trait for season adaption and grain yield, which is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. During the last decade, as the nature of florigen was identified, notable progress has been made on exploration how florigen gene expression is genetically controlled. In Arabidopsis expression of certain key flowering integrators such as FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are also epigenetically regulated by various chromatin modifications, however, very little is known in rice on this aspect until very recently. This review summarized the advances of both genetic networks and chromatin modifications in rice flowering time control, attempting to give a complete view of the genetic and epigenetic architecture in complex network of rice flowering pathways.
25091740	Induction of immune responses in mice and pigs by oral administration of classical swine fever virus E2 protein expressed in rice calli.	2014	Arch Virol	Classical swine fever (CSF), caused by the CSF virus (CSFV), is a highly contagious disease in pigs. In Korea, vaccination using a live-attenuated strain (LOM strain) has been used to control the disease. However, parenteral vaccination using a live-attenuated strain still faces a number of problems related to storage, cost, injection stress, and differentiation of CSFV infected and vaccinated pigs. Therefore, two kinds of new candidates for oral vaccination have been developed based on the translation of the E2 gene of the SW03 strain, which was isolated from an outbreak of CSF in 2002 in Korea, in transgenic rice calli (TRCs) from Oriza sativa L. cv. Dongjin to express a recombinant E2 protein (rE2-TRCs). The expression of the recombinant E2 protein (rE2) in rE2-TRCs was confirmed using Northern blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis. Immune responses to the rE2-TRC in mice and pigs were investigated after oral administration. The administration of rE2-TRCs increased E2-specific antibodies titers and antibody-secreting cells when compared to animals receiving the vector alone (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). In addition, mice receiving rE2-TRCs had a higher level of CD8+ lymphocytes and Th1 cytokine immune responses to purified rE2 (prE2) in vitro than the controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Pigs receiving rE2-TRCs also showed an increase in IL-8, CCL2, and the CD8+ subpopulation in response to stimulation with prE2. These results suggest that oral administration of rE2-TRCs can induce E2-specific immune responses.
25320467	H2O2 pretreated rice seedlings specifically reduces arsenate not arsenite: difference in nutrient uptake and antioxidant defense response in a contrasting pair of rice cultivars.	2014	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	The study investigated the reduction in metalloid uptake at equimolar concentrations (~53.3 μM) of As(III) and As(V) in contrasting pair of rice seedlings by pretreating with H2O2 (1.0 μM) and SA (1.0 mM). Results obtained from the contrasting pair (arsenic tolerant vs. sensitive) of rice seedlings (cv. Pant Dhan 11 and MTU 7029, respectively) shows that pretreatment of H2O2 and H2O2 + SA reduces As(V) uptake significantly in both the cultivars, while no reduction in the As(III) uptake. The higher growth inhibition, higher H2O2 and TBARS content in sensitive cultivar against As(III) and As(V) treatments along with higher As accumulation (~1.2 mg g(-1) dw) than in cv. P11, unravels the fundamental difference in the response between the sensitive and tolerant cultivar. In the H2O2 pretreated plants, the translocation of As increased in tolerant cultivar against AsIII, whereas, it decreased in sensitive cultivar both against AsIII and AsV. In both the cultivars translocation of Mn increased in the H2O2 pretreated plants against As(III), whereas, the translocation of Cu increased against As(V). In tolerant cultivar the translocation of Fe increased against As(V) with H2O2 pretreatment whereas, it decreased in the sensitive cultivar. In both the cultivars, Zn translocation increased against As(III) and decreased against As(V). The higher level of H2O2 and SOD (EC 1.15.1.1) activity in sensitive cultivar whereas, higher, APX (EC 1.11.1.11), GR (EC 1.6.4.2) and GST (EC 1.6.4.2) activity in tolerant cultivar, also demonstrated the differential anti-oxidative defence responses between the contrasting rice cultivars.
25126953	Differential activity of Striga hermonthica seed germination stimulants and Gigaspora rosea hyphal branching factors in rice and their contribution to underground communication.	2014	PLoS One	Strigolactones (SLs) trigger germination of parasitic plant seeds and hyphal branching of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. There is extensive structural variation in SLs and plants usually produce blends of different SLs. The structural variation among natural SLs has been shown to impact their biological activity as hyphal branching and parasitic plant seed germination stimulants. In this study, rice root exudates were fractioned by HPLC. The resulting fractions were analyzed by MRM-LC-MS to investigate the presence of SLs and tested using bioassays to assess their Striga hermonthica seed germination and Gigaspora rosea hyphal branching stimulatory activities. A substantial number of active fractions were revealed often with very different effect on seed germination and hyphal branching. Fractions containing (-)-orobanchol and ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol contributed little to the induction of S. hermonthica seed germination but strongly stimulated AM fungal hyphal branching. Three SLs in one fraction, putative methoxy-5-deoxystrigol isomers, had moderate seed germination and hyphal branching inducing activity. Two fractions contained strong germination stimulants but displayed only modest hyphal branching activity. We provide evidence that these stimulants are likely SLs although no SL-representative masses could be detected using MRM-LC-MS. Our results show that seed germination and hyphal branching are induced to very different extents by the various SLs (or other stimulants) present in rice root exudates. We propose that the development of rice varieties with different SL composition is a promising strategy to reduce parasitic plant infestation while maintaining symbiosis with AM fungi.
25187932	Engineering a sensitive visual-tracking reporter system for real-time monitoring phosphorus deficiency in tobacco.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Plant phosphorus (P) diagnosis is widely used for monitoring P status and guiding P fertilizer application in field conditions. The common methods for predicting plant response to P are time- and labour-consuming chemical measurements of the extractable soil P and plant P concentrations. In this study, we successfully generated a visual reporter system in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) to monitor plant P status by expressing of a Purple gene (Pr) isolated from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis) driven by the promoter (Pro) of OsPT6, a P-starvation-induced rice gene. The leaves of OsPT6pro::Pr (PT6pro::Pr) transgenic tobacco continuously turned into dark purple with the increase of duration and severity of P deficiency, and recovered rapidly to basal green colour upon resupply of P. The expression of several anthocyanin biosynthesis involving genes was strongly activated in the transgenic tobacco in comparison to wild type under P-deficient condition. Such additive purple colour was not detected by deficiencies of other major- and micronutrients or stresses of salt, drought and cold. There was an extremely high correlation between P concentration and anthocyanin accumulation in the transgenic tobacco leaves. Using a hyperspectral sensing technology, P concentration in the leaves of transgenic plants could be predicted by the reflectance spectra at 554 nm wavelength with approximately 0.16 as the threshold value of the P deficiency. Taken together, the colour-based visual reporter system could be specifically and readily used for monitoring the plant P status by naked eyes and accurately assessed by spectral reflectance.
25124680	Proteomics study of silver nanoparticles toxicity on Oryza sativa L.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The increasing use of silver nanoparticles, (AgNPs), will inevitably result in their release into the environment and thereby cause the exposure to plants. It was claimed that using AgNPs is a safe and efficient method to preserve and treat agents of disease in agriculture. This study tries to understand the protein populations and sub-populations and follow up environmental AgNPs stresses. To accomplish these, the action of homemade spherical AgNPs colloidal suspension against Oryza sativa L. was investigated by a proteomic approach (2-DE and NanoLC/FT-ICR MS identification). Twenty-eight responsive (decrement/increment in abundance) proteins were identified. Proteomic results revealed that an exposure of O. sativa L., root with different concentrations of AgNPs resulted in an accumulation of protein precursors, indicative of the dissipation of a proton motive force. The identified proteins are involved in oxidative stress tolerance, Ca(2+) regulation and signaling, transcription and protein degradation, cell wall and DNA/RNA/protein direct damage, cell division and apoptosis. The expression pattern of these proteins and their possible involvement in the nontoxicity mechanisms were discussed.
25164029	Trehalose pretreatment induces salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings: oxidative damage and co-induction of antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems.	2015	Protoplasma	Salinity in the form of abiotic stress adversely effects plant growth, development, and productivity. Various osmoprotectants are involved in regulating plant responses to salinity; however, the precise role of trehalose (Tre) in this process remains to be further elucidated. The present study investigated the regulatory role of Tre in alleviating salt-induced oxidative stress in hydroponically grown rice seedlings. Salt stress (150 and 250 mM NaCl) for 72 h resulted in toxicity symptoms such as stunted growth, severe yellowing, and leaf rolling, particularly at 250 mM NaCl. Histochemical observation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; O2 (∙-) and H2O2) indicated evident oxidative stress in salt-stressed seedlings. In these seedlings, the levels of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, and proline (Pro) increased significantly whereas total chlorophyll (Chl) and relative water content (RWC) decreased. Salt stress caused an imbalance in non-enzymatic antioxidants, i.e., ascorbic acid (AsA) content, AsA/DHA ratio, and GSH/GSSG ratio decreased but glutathione (GSH) content increased significantly. In contrast, Tre pretreatment (10 mM, 48 h) significantly addressed salt-induced toxicity symptoms and dramatically depressed LOX activity, ROS, MDA, and Pro accumulation whereas AsA, GSH, RWC, Chl contents, and redox status improved considerably. Salt stress stimulated the activities of SOD, GPX, APX, MDHAR, DHAR, and GR but decreased the activities of CAT and GST. However, Tre-pretreated salt-stressed seedlings counteracted SOD and MDHAR activities, elevated CAT and GST activities, further enhanced APX and DHAR activities, and maintained GPX and GR activities similar to the seedlings stressed with salt alone. In addition, Tre pretreatment enhanced the activities of methylglyoxal detoxifying enzymes (Gly I and Gly II) more efficiently in salt-stressed seedlings. Our results suggest a role for Tre in protecting against salt-induced oxidative damage attributed to reduced ROS accumulation, elevation of non-enzymatic antioxidants, and co-activation of the antioxidative and glyoxalase systems.
25138437	OsABCG15 encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: An ABC transporter gene ( OsABCG15 ) was proven to be involved in pollen development in rice. The corresponding protein was localized on the plasma membrane using subcellular localization. Wax, cutin, and sporopollenin are important for normal development of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, respectively. Their lipid soluble precursors, which are produced in the tapetum, are then secreted and transferred to the anther and microspore surface for polymerization. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the transport of these precursors. Here, we identified and characterized a member of the G subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, OsABCG15, which is required for the secretion of these lipid-soluble precursors in rice. Using map-based cloning, we found a spontaneous A-to-C transition in the fourth exon of OsABCG15 that caused an amino acid substitution of Thr-to-Pro in the predicted ATP-binding domain of the protein sequence. This osabcg15 mutant failed to produce any viable pollen and was completely male sterile. Histological analysis indicated that osabcg15 exhibited an undeveloped anther cuticle, enlarged middle layer, abnormal Ubisch body development, tapetum degeneration with a falling apart style, and collapsed pollen grains without detectable exine. OsABCG15 was expressed preferentially in the tapetum, and the fused GFP-OsABCG15 protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Our results suggested that OsABCG15 played an essential role in the formation of the rice anther cuticle and pollen exine. This role may include the secretion of the lipid precursors from the tapetum to facilitate the transfer of precursors to the surface of the anther epidermis as well as to microspores.
25104551	Maize early endosperm growth and development: from fertilization through cell type differentiation.	2014	Am J Bot	UNLABELLED: •

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Given the worldwide economic importance of maize endosperm, it is surprising that its development is not the most comprehensively studied of the cereals. We present detailed morphometric and cytological descriptions of endosperm development in the maize inbred line B73, for which the genome has been sequenced, and compare its growth with four diverse Nested Association Mapping (NAM) founder lines.•

METHODS: The first 12 d of B73 endosperm development were described using semithin sections of plastic-embedded kernels and confocal microscopy. Longitudinal sections were used to compare endosperm length, thickness, and area.•

KEY RESULTS: Morphometric comparison between Arizona- and Michigan-grown B73 showed a common pattern. Early endosperm development was divided into four stages: coenocytic, cellularization through alveolation, cellularization through partitioning, and differentiation. We observed tightly synchronous nuclear divisions in the coenocyte, elucidated that the onset of cellularization was coincident with endosperm size, and identified a previously undefined cell type (basal intermediate zone, BIZ). NAM founders with small mature kernels had larger endosperms (0-6 d after pollination) than lines with large mature kernels.•

CONCLUSIONS: Our B73-specific model of early endosperm growth links developmental events to relative endosperm size, while accounting for diverse growing conditions. Maize endosperm cellularizes through alveolation, then random partitioning of the central vacuole. This unique cellularization feature of maize contrasts with the smaller endosperms of Arabidopsis, barley, and rice that strictly cellularize through repeated alveolation. NAM analysis revealed differences in endosperm size during early development, which potentially relates to differences in timing of cellularization across diverse lines of maize.
25039887	Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase is involved in the synthesis of melatonin by methylating N-acetylserotonin in Arabidopsis.	2014	J Pineal Res	Although a plant N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) was recently cloned from rice, homologous genes appear to be absent in dicotyledonous plants. To clone an ASMT de novo from a dicotyledonous plant, we expressed eight Arabidopsis thaliana O-methyltransferase (OMT) cDNAs in Escherichia coli and screened for ASMT activity by measuring melatonin production after the application of 1 mm N-acetylserotonin (NAS). Among the eight strains harboring the full-length cDNAs, the OMT3 strain produced high levels of melatonin, suggesting that OMT3 encodes an active ASMT. OMT3 is already known as caffeic acid OMT (COMT), suggesting multiple functions for this enzyme. The purified recombinant A. thaliana COMT (AtCOMT) showed high ASMT activity, catalyzing the conversion of NAS to melatonin. The Km and Vmax values for ASMT activity were 233 μm and 1800 pmol/min/mg protein, while the Km and Vmax values for COMT activity were 103 μm and 564,000 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The catalytic efficiency (Vmax /Km ) for ASMT activity was 709-fold lower than for COMT. In vitro, ASMT activity was dramatically decreased by the addition of caffeic acid in a dose-dependent manner, but the activity of COMT was not altered by NAS. Lastly, the Arabidopsis comt knockout mutant exhibited less production of melatonin than the wild type when Arabidopsis leaves were infiltrated with 1 mm NAS, suggestive of in vivo role of COMT in melatonin biosynthesis in plants.
25111047	The blast resistance gene Pi54of cloned from Oryza officinalis interacts with Avr-Pi54 through its novel non-LRR domains.	2014	PLoS One	The dominant rice blast resistance gene Pi54 cloned by map-based cloning approach from indica rice cultivar Tetep confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. In this investigation, an orthologue of Pi54 designated as Pi54of was cloned from Oryza officinalis conferring high degree of resistance to M. oryzae and is functionally validated. We have also characterized the Pi54of protein and demonstrate its interaction with AVR-Pi54 protein. The Pi54of encoded ∼43 kDa small and unique cytoplasmic LRR family of disease resistance protein having unique Zinc finger domain overlapped with the leucine rich repeat regions. Pi54of showed Magnaporthe-induced expression. The phylogenetic and western blot analysis confirmed orthologous nature of Pi54 and Pi54of genes, whereas the identity of protein was confirmed through MALDI-TOF analysis. The in silico analysis showed that Pi54of is structurally more stable than other cloned Pi54 proteins. The molecular docking revealed that Pi54of protein interacts with AVR-Pi54 through novel non-LRR domains such as STI1 and RhoGEF. The STI1 and GEF domains which interact with AVR-Pi54 are also components of rice defensome complex. The Pi54of protein showed differential domain specificity while interacting with the AVR protein. Functional complementation revealed that Pi54of transferred in two rice lines belonging to indica and japonica background imparts enhanced resistance against three highly virulent strains of M. oryzae. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54of cloned from wild species of rice provides high degree of resistance to M. oryzae and might display different molecular mechanism involved in AVRPi54-Pi54of interaction.
25149369	Molecular genetic dissection of quantitative trait loci regulating rice grain size.	2014	Annu Rev Genet	Grain size is one of the most important factors determining rice yield. As a quantitative trait, grain size is predominantly and tightly controlled by genetic factors. Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain size have been molecularly identified and characterized. These QTLs may act in independent genetic pathways and, along with other identified genes for grain size, are mainly involved in the signaling pathways mediated by proteasomal degradation, phytohormones, and G proteins to regulate cell proliferation and cell elongation. Many of these QTLs and genes have been strongly selected for enhanced rice productivity during domestication and breeding. These findings have paved new ways for understanding the molecular basis of grain size and have substantial implications for genetic improvement of crops.
25081486	OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	OsMADS32 is a monocot specific MIKC(c) type MADS-box gene that plays an important role in regulating rice floral meristem and organs identity, a crucial process for reproductive success and rice yield. However, its underlying mechanism of action remains to be clarified. Here, we characterized a hypomorphic mutant allele of OsMADS32/CFO1, cfo1-3 and identified its function in controlling rice flower development by bioinformatics and protein-protein interaction analysis. The cfo1-3 mutant produces defective flowers, including loss of lodicule identity, formation of ectopic lodicule or hull-like organs and decreased stamen number, mimicking phenotypes related to the mutation of B class genes. Molecular characterization indicated that mis-splicing of OsMADS32 transcripts in the cfo1-3 mutant resulted in an extra eight amino acids in the K-domain of OsMADS32 protein. By yeast two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we revealed that the insertion of eight amino acids or deletion of the internal region in the K1 subdomain of OsMADS32 affects the interaction between OsMADS32 with PISTILLATA (PI)-like proteins OsMADS2 and OsMADS4. This work provides new insight into the mechanism by which OsMADS32 regulates rice lodicule and stamen identity, by interaction with two PI-like proteins via its K domain.
25047511	Identification of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding proteins by heparin-agarose affinity purification and LTQ ORBITRAP MS in Oryza sativa.	2014	Proteomics	Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosohate (IP3 ) and its receptors play a pivotal role in calcium signal transduction in mammals. However, no homologs of mammalian IP3 receptors have been found in plants. In this study, we isolated the microsomal fractions from rice cells in suspension culture and further obtained putative IP3 -binding proteins by heparin-agarose affinity purification. The IP3 -binding activities of these protein fractions were determined by [(3) H] IP3 -binding assay. SDS-PAGE and MS analysis were then performed to characterize these proteins. We have identified 297 proteins from the eluates of heparin-agarose column chromatography, which will provide insight into the IP3 signaling pathways in plants. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000763 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000763).
25118653	In silico analysis for five major cereal crops phytocystatins.	2014	Interdiscip Sci	Five major cereal crops like rice, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum are continuously threatened by a multitude of pathogens and other disorders. Cystatins offers a pivotal role in deciding the promising plant response. The use of bioinformatics tools for phylogenetic relationships of five major cereal crops (rice, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum) phytocystatins based on amino acid sequence information was elucidated and their secondary and tertiary structures were investigated for structural comparisons. Twenty eight distinct phytocystatins from 28 plant species were investigated. Phytocystatins could be divided into five distinct phylogenetic groups. Five major cereal crops their structural features were highly conserved their amino acid sequence similarities ranged from 48 to 86%. A new highly conserved amino acid sequence motif, YEAKxWxKxF, in the C-terminal end being unique to phytocystatins was identified. The predicted 3D homology models showed a high conservation of the general central structure of the phytocystatins i.e. the 4-5 anti-parallel β-sheets, wrapping halfway round a single central α-helix and particularly the three active site regions, the N-terminal, the 1st and 2nd hairpin loops. Any structural differences seem to be mainly in the length of the N and C terminal, the length of the 2nd hairpin loop and the 5th β-sheet. Via docking experiments, small heterogeneities were observed in the vicinity of the OC-I active sites that seemed to be influential in the binding process and stability of the resultant inhibitor-protease complex.
24742074	Stepwise arms race between AvrPik and Pik alleles in the rice blast pathosystem.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	A stepwise mutation that occurred in both pathogens and their respective hosts has played a seminal role in the co-evolutionary arms race evolution in diverse pathosystems. The process driven by rice blast AvrPik and Pik alleles was investigated through population genetic and evolutionary approaches. The genetic diversity of the non-signal domain of AvrPik was higher than that in its signal peptide domain. Positive selection for particular AvrPik alleles in the northeastern region of China was stronger than in the south. The perfect relationship between the functional lineages and AvrPik allele-specific pathotypes was established by ruling out the nonfunctional lineages derived from additional copies. Only four alleles conditioning stepwise pathotypes were detected in natural populations, which were likely created by only one evolutionary pathway with three recognizable mutation steps. Two non-stepwise pathotypes were determined by two blocks in a network constructed by all 16 possible alleles, indicating that a natural evolution process can be artificially changed by a combination of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Assuming that AvrPik evolution has been largely driven by host selection, the co-evolutionary stepwise relationships between AvrPik and Pik was established. The experimental validation of stepwise mutation is required for the development of sustainable management strategies against plant disease.
25122453	Sorghum phytochrome B inhibits flowering in long days by activating expression of SbPRR37 and SbGHD7, repressors of SbEHD1, SbCN8 and SbCN12.	2014	PLoS One	Light signaling by phytochrome B in long days inhibits flowering in sorghum by increasing expression of the long day floral repressors PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR PROTEIN (SbPRR37, Ma1) and GRAIN NUMBER, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 7 (SbGHD7, Ma6). SbPRR37 and SbGHD7 RNA abundance peaks in the morning and in the evening of long days through coordinate regulation by light and output from the circadian clock. 58 M, a phytochrome B deficient (phyB-1, ma3R) genotype, flowered ∼60 days earlier than 100 M (PHYB, Ma3) in long days and ∼11 days earlier in short days. Populations derived from 58 M (Ma1, ma3R, Ma5, ma6) and R.07007 (Ma1, Ma3, ma5, Ma6) varied in flowering time due to QTL aligned to PHYB/phyB-1 (Ma3), Ma5, and GHD7/ghd7-1 (Ma6). PHYC was proposed as a candidate gene for Ma5 based on alignment and allelic variation. PHYB and Ma5 (PHYC) were epistatic to Ma1 and Ma6 and progeny recessive for either gene flowered early in long days. Light signaling mediated by PhyB was required for high expression of the floral repressors SbPRR37 and SbGHD7 during the evening of long days. In 100 M (PHYB) the floral activators SbEHD1, SbCN8 and SbCN12 were repressed in long days and de-repressed in short days. In 58 M (phyB-1) these genes were highly expressed in long and short days. Furthermore, SbCN15, the ortholog of rice Hd3a (FT), is expressed at low levels in 100 M but at high levels in 58 M (phyB-1) regardless of day length, indicating that PhyB regulation of SbCN15 expression may modify flowering time in a photoperiod-insensitive manner.
25121640	Quantitative Trait Loci from Two Genotypes of Oat (Avena sativa) Conditioning Resistance to Puccinia coronata.	2015	Phytopathology	Developing oat cultivars with partial resistance to crown rust would be beneficial and cost-effective for disease management. Two recombinant inbred-line populations were generated by crossing the susceptible cultivar Provena with two partially resistant sources, CDC Boyer and breeding line 94197A1-9-2-2-2-5. A third mapping population was generated by crossing the partially resistant sources to validate the quantitative trait locus (QTL) results. The three populations were evaluated for crown rust severity in the field at Louisiana State University (LSU) in 2009 and 2010 and at the Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL) in St. Paul, MN, in 2009, 2010, and 2011. An iSelect platform assay containing 5,744 oat single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to genotype the populations. From the 2009 CDL test, linkage analyses revealed two QTLs for partial resistance in the Provena/CDC Boyer population on chromosome 19A. One of the 19A QTLs was also detected in the 2009 LSU test. Another QTL was detected on chromosome 12D in the CDL 2009 test. In the Provena/94197A1-9-2-2-2-5 population, only one QTL was detected, on chromosome 13A, in the CDL 2011 test. The 13A QTL from the Provena/94197A1-9-2-2-2-5 population was validated in the CDC Boyer/94197A1-9-2-2-2-5 population in the CDL 2010 and 2011 tests. Comparative analysis of the significant marker sequences with the rice genome database revealed 15 candidate genes for disease resistance on chromosomes 4 and 6 of rice. These genes could be potential targets for cloning from the two resistant parents.
25098420	The diversity of rice phytocystatins.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Phytocystatins encompass a family of plant competitive cysteine proteinase inhibitors. They are encoded by part of a conserved monophyletic group of genes that are found in all eukaryotes. The primary targets of phytocystatins are papain-like cysteine proteinases. However, a group of larger phytocystatins is also able to inhibit proteinases such as legumains. Phytocystatins have been implicated in several physiological processes and act within an intricate proteolytic regulatory network. The present work characterizes the gene family of rice phytocystatins, which contains twelve genes with different features. Phylogenetic analyses cluster rice phytocystatins into three main groups. Group 1 is composed of OcI, OcIII and OcXII and is nearly ubiquitous and highly expressed in plants under normal and stressed conditions including salt, wounding, ABA or a fungal elicitor such as chitosan. Rice phytocystatins can contribute to plant senescence and may exhibit an inverse correlation between their gene expression and the activities of their target proteinases. This work contributes to clarifying the roles of individual phytocystatin genes in plant processes such as germination and response to environmental stresses.
25093982	Analysis on blast fungus-responsive characters of a flavonoid phytoalexin sakuranetin; accumulation in infected rice leaves, antifungal activity and detoxification by fungus.	2014	Molecules	To understand the role of the rice flavonoid phytoalexin (PA) sakuranetin for blast resistance, the fungus-responsive characteristics were studied. Young rice leaves in a resistant line exhibited hypersensitive reaction (HR) within 3 days post inoculation (dpi) of a spore suspension, and an increase in sakuranetin was detected at 3 dpi, increasing to 4-fold at 4 dpi. In the susceptible line, increased sakuranetin was detected at 4 dpi, but not at 3 dpi, by which a large fungus mass has accumulated without HR. Induced expression of a PA biosynthesis gene OsNOMT for naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase was found before accumulation of sakuranetin in both cultivars. The antifungal activity of sakuranetin was considerably higher than that of the major rice diterpenoid PA momilactone A in vitro and in vivo under similar experimental conditions. The decrease and detoxification of sakuranetin were detected in both solid and liquid mycelium cultures, and they took place slower than those of momilactone A. Estimated local concentration of sakuranetin at HR lesions was thought to be effective for fungus restriction, while that at enlarged lesions in susceptible rice was insufficient. These results indicate possible involvement of sakuranetin in blast resistance and its specific relation to blast fungus.
25128291	Nitrogen limitation and high density responses in rice suggest a role for ethylene under high density stress.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: High density stress, also known as intraspecies competition, causes significant yield losses in a wide variety of crop plants. At the same time, increases in density tolerance through selective breeding and the concomitant ability to plant crops at a higher population density has been one of the most important factors in the development of high yielding modern cultivars.

RESULTS: Physiological changes underlying high density stress were examined in Oryza sativa plants over the course of a life cycle by assessing differences in gene expression and metabolism. Moreover, the nitrogen limitation was examined in parallel with high density stress to gain a better understanding of physiological responses specific to high density stress. While both nitrogen limitation and high density resulted in decreased shoot fresh weight, tiller number, plant height and chlorophyll content, high density stress alone had a greater impact on physiological factors. Decreases in aspartate and glutamate concentration were found in plants grown under both stress conditions; however, high density stress had a more significant effect on the concentration of these amino acids. Global transcriptome analysis revealed a large proportion of genes with altered expression in response to both stresses. The presence of ethylene-associated genes in a majority of density responsive genes was investigated further. Expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes ACC synthase 1, ACC synthase 2 and ACC oxidase 7 were found to be upregulated in plants under high density stress. Plants at high density were also found to up regulate ethylene-associated genes and senescence genes, while cytokinin response and biosynthesis genes were down regulated, consistent with higher ethylene production.

CONCLUSIONS: High density stress has similar but greater impact on plant growth and development compared to nitrogen limitation. Global transcriptome changes implicate ethylene as a volatile signal used to communicate proximity in under dense population growth condition and suggest a role for phytohormones in high density stress response in rice plants.
25238657	Transcriptional profiling of the lectin ArathEULS3 from Arabidopsis thaliana toward abiotic stresses.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The family of EUL-related lectins groups all proteins with an Euonymus lectin (EUL) domain, a protein motif which is highly conserved throughout the plant kingdom and occurs as part of many chimeric proteins with different domain architectures. The S3 type EUL lectin from Arabidopsis thaliana (ArathEULS3) has become the model protein within this EUL family. Based on sequence homology to an ABA/NaCl inducible gene from rice and some publicly available high-throughput micro-array data, it was hypothesized that ArathEULS3 is transcriptionally regulated by osmotic stress responses. Here we present a detailed expression analysis of the ArathEULS3 lectin gene. Under normal growth conditions, ArathEULS3 is stably expressed throughout plant development. After ABA, NaCl and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments transcription is upregulated. Furthermore, in silico promoter and co-expression analyses suggested the A. thaliana Homeobox 7 (ATHB-7) as a candidate transcription factor that may regulate ArathEULS3 expression. Taken together, our data confirm that the ArathEULS3 lectin gene indeed shows a stress-inducible expression pattern. We speculate on a role for ArathEULS3 in the plant stress response.
25145641	Variation in soil aluminium tolerance genes is associated with local adaptation to soils at the Park Grass Experiment.	2014	Mol Ecol	Studies of the wild grass Anthoxanthum odoratum at the long-term Park Grass Experiment (PGE, Harpenden, UK) document a well-known example of rapid plant evolution in response to environmental change. Repeated fertilizer applications have acidified the soil in some experimental plots over the past 150+ years, and Anthoxanthum subpopulations have quickly become locally adapted. Early reciprocal transplants showed subpopulation differentiation specifically in response to soil aluminium (Al) toxicity across the experiment, even at small (30 m) spatial scales. Almost 40 years after its original measurement, we reassessed the degree of local adaptation to soil Al at the PGE using updated phenotyping methods and identified genes with variation linked to the tolerance trait. Root growth assays show that plants are locally adapted to soil Al at both the seedling and adult growth stages, but to a smaller extent than previously inferred. Among a large suite of candidate loci that were previously shown to have Al-sensitive expression differences between sensitive and tolerant plants, three loci contained SNPs that are associated with both Al tolerance and soil acidity: an Al-sensitive malate transporter (ALMT), a tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) and the putative homolog of the rice cell-wall modification gene STAR1. Natural genetic variation at these loci is likely to have contributed to the recent rapid evolution at PGE. Continued study of Al tolerance variants in Anthoxanthum will allow us to test hypotheses about the nature and source of genetic variation that enables some species to adapt to soil acidification and other types of rapid environmental change.
23956237	Influence of rice black streaked dwarf virus on the ecological fitness of non-vector planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2014	Insect Sci	Rice black streak dwarf virus (RBSDV) is transmitted by the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallen). Non-vector rice brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), shares the same host rice plants with SBPH in paddy fields. The changes in nutritional composition of rice plants infected by RBSDV and the ecological fitness of BPH feeding on the infected plants were studied under both artificial climate chamber and field conditions. Contents of 16 detected amino acids and soluble sugar in RBSDV infected rice plants were higher than those in the healthy ones. On the diseased plants BPH had significantly higher nymphal survival rates, nymphal duration of the males, weight of the female adults, as well as egg hatchability compared to BPH being fed on healthy plants. However, there was no obvious difference in female nymph duration, longevity and fecundity. Defense enzymes (superoxidase dismutase, SOD and catalase, CAT) and detoxifying enzymes (carboxylesterase, CAE and glutathione S-transferase, GST) in BPH adults fed on diseased plants had markedly higher activities. The results indicate rice plants infected by RBSDV improved the ecological fitness of the brown planthopper, a serious pest but not a transmitter of the RBSDV virus.
25122473	The impact of herbicide-resistant rice technology on phenotypic diversity and population structure of United States weedy rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	The use of herbicide-resistant (HR) Clearfield rice (Oryza sativa) to control weedy rice has increased in the past 12 years to constitute about 60% of rice acreage in Arkansas, where most U.S. rice is grown. To assess the impact of HR cultivated rice on the herbicide resistance and population structure of weedy rice, weedy samples were collected from commercial fields with a history of Clearfield rice. Panicles from each weedy type were harvested and tested for resistance to imazethapyr. The majority of plants sampled had at least 20% resistant offspring. These resistant weeds were 97 to 199 cm tall and initiated flowering from 78 to 128 d, generally later than recorded for accessions collected prior to the widespread use of Clearfield rice (i.e. historical accessions). Whereas the majority (70%) of historical accessions had straw-colored hulls, only 30% of contemporary HR weedy rice had straw-colored hulls. Analysis of genotyping-by-sequencing data showed that HR weeds were not genetically structured according to hull color, whereas historical weedy rice was separated into straw-hull and black-hull populations. A significant portion of the local rice crop genome was introgressed into HR weedy rice, which was rare in historical weedy accessions. Admixture analyses showed that HR weeds tend to possess crop haplotypes in the portion of chromosome 2 containing the ACETOLACTATE SYNTHASE gene, which confers herbicide resistance to Clearfield rice. Thus, U.S. HR weedy rice is a distinct population relative to historical weedy rice and shows modifications in morphology and phenology that are relevant to weed management.
25140876	The effects of fluctuations in the nutrient supply on the expression of five members of the AGL17 clade of MADS-box genes in rice.	2014	PLoS One	The ANR1 MADS-box gene in Arabidopsis is a key gene involved in regulating lateral root development in response to the external nitrate supply. There are five ANR1-like genes in Oryza sativa, OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27, OsMADS57 and OsMADS61, all of which belong to the AGL17 clade. Here we have investigated the responsiveness of these genes to fluctuations in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) mineral nutrient supply. The MADS-box genes have been shown to have a range of responses to the nutrient supply. The expression of OsMADS61 was transiently induced by N deprivation but was not affected by re-supply with various N sources. The expression of OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 was induced by re-supplying with NO3(-) and NH4NO3, but downregulated by NH4(+). The expression of OsMADS57 was significantly downregulated by N starvation and upregulated by 3 h NO3(-) re-supply. OsMADS23 was the only gene that showed no response to either N starvation nor NO3(-) re-supply. OsMADS57 was the only gene not regulated by P fluctuation whereas the expression of OsMADS23, OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 was downregulated by P starvation and P re-supply. In contrast, all five ANR1-related genes were significantly upregulated by S starvation. Our results also indicated that there were interactions among nitrate, sulphate and phosphate transporters in rice.
25189236	Gene interactions and genetics of blast resistance and yield attributes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	J Genet	Blast disease caused by the pathogen Pyricularia oryzae is a serious threat to rice production. Six generations viz., P1, P2, F1, F2, B1 and B2 of a cross between blast susceptible high-yielding rice cultivar ADT 43 and resistant near isogenic line (NIL) CT13432-3R, carrying four blast resistance genes Pi1, Pi2, Pi33 and Pi54 in combination were used to study the nature and magnitude of gene action for disease resistance and yield attributes. The epistatic interaction model was found adequate to explain the gene action in most of the traits. The interaction was complementary for number of productive tillers, economic yield, lesion number, infected leaf area and potential disease incidence but duplicate epistasis was observed for the remaining traits. Among the genotypes tested under epiphytotic conditions, gene pyramided lines were highly resistant to blast compared to individuals with single genes indicating that the nonallelic genes have a complementary effect when present together. The information on genetics of various contributing traits of resistance will further aid plant breeders in choosing appropriate breeding strategy for blast resistance and yield enhancement in rice.
25161881	Differential activity of rice protein disulfide isomerase family members for disulfide bond formation and reduction.	2014	FEBS Open Bio	Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), a family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that are ubiquitous in all eukaryotes, are the principal catalysts for disulfide bond formation. Here, we investigated three rice (Oryza sativa) PDI family members (PDIL1;1, PDIL1;4, and PDIL2;3) and found that PDIL1;1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity for both disulfide bond formation and disulfide bond reduction. The activity of PDIL1;1-catalyzed disulfide bond reduction, in which two redox-active sites were involved, was enhanced by increasing the glutathione concentration. These results suggest that PDIL1;1 plays primary roles in both disulfide bond formation and disulfide bond reduction, which allow for redox control of protein quality and packaging.
25168932	Overexpression of a rice heme activator protein gene (OsHAP2E) confers resistance to pathogens, salinity and drought, and increases photosynthesis and tiller number.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Heme activator protein (HAP), also known as nuclear factor Y or CCAAT binding factor (HAP/NF-Y/CBF), has important functions in regulating plant growth, development and stress responses. The expression of rice HAP gene (OsHAP2E) was induced by probenazole (PBZ), a chemical inducer of disease resistance. To characterize the gene, the chimeric gene (OsHAP2E::GUS) engineered to carry the structural gene encoding β-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the promoter from OsHAP2E was introduced into rice. The transgenic lines of OsHAP2Ein::GUS with the intron showed high GUS activity in the wounds and surrounding tissues. When treated by salicylic acid (SA), isonicotinic acid (INA), abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), the lines showed GUS activity exclusively in vascular tissues and mesophyll cells. This activity was enhanced after inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae or Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The OsHAP2E expression level was also induced after inoculation of rice with M. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae and after treatment with SA, INA, ABA and H2 O2, respectively. We further produced transgenic rice overexpressing OsHAP2E. These lines conferred resistance to M. oryzae or X. oryzae pv. oryzae and to salinity and drought. Furthermore, they showed a higher photosynthetic rate and an increased number of tillers. Microarray analysis showed up-regulation of defence-related genes. These results suggest that this gene could contribute to conferring biotic and abiotic resistances and increasing photosynthesis and tiller numbers.
25189234	A substitution mutation in OsCCD7 cosegregates with dwarf and increased tillering phenotype in rice.	2014	J Genet	Dwarf plant height and tillering ability are two of the most important agronomic traits that determine the plant architecture, and have profound influence on grain yield in rice. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling these two traits, an EMS-induced recessive dwarf and increased tillering1 (dit1) mutant was characterized. The mutant showed proportionate reduction in each internode as compared to wild type revealing that it belonged to the category of dn-type of dwarf mutants. Besides, exogenous application of GA3 and 24-epibrassinolide, did not have any effect on the phenotype of the mutant. The gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4, identified through positional candidate approach and verified by cosegregation analysis. It was found to encode carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase7 (CCD7) and identified as an allele of htd1. The mutant carried substitution of two nucleotides CC to AA in the sixth exon of the gene that resulted in substitution of serine by a stop codon in the mutant, and thus formation of a truncated protein, unlike amino acid substitution event in htd1. The new allele will facilitate further functional characterization of this gene, which may lead to unfolding of newer signalling pathways involving plant development and architecture.
25073727	Comparative metabolomic analysis of wild type and mads3 mutant rice anthers.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) MADS3 transcription factor regulates the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during late anther development, and one MADS3 mutant, mads3-4, has defective anther walls, aborted microspores and complete male sterility. Here, we report the untargeted metabolomic analysis of both wild type and mads3-4 mature anthers. Mutation of MADS3 led to an unbalanced redox status and caused oxidative stress that damages lipid, protein, and DNA. To cope with oxidative stress in mads3-4 anthers, soluble sugars were mobilized and carbohydrate metabolism was shifted to amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism to provide substrates for the biosynthesis of antioxidant proteins and the repair of DNA. Mutation of MADS3 also affected other aspects of rice anther development such as secondary metabolites associated with cuticle, cell wall, and auxin metabolism. Many of the discovered metabolic changes in mads3-4 anthers were corroborated with changes of expression levels of corresponding metabolic pathway genes. Altogether, this comparative metabolomic analysis indicated that MADS3 gene affects rice anther development far beyond the ROS homeostasis regulation.
25157260	Establishment of the chloroplast genetic system in rice during early leaf development and at low temperatures.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Chloroplasts are the central nodes of the metabolic network in leaf cells of higher plants, and the conversion of proplastids into chloroplasts is tightly coupled to leaf development. During early leaf development, the structure and function of the chloroplasts differ greatly from those in a mature leaf, suggesting the existence of a stage-specific mechanism regulating chloroplast development during this period. Here, we discuss the identification of the genes affected in low temperature-conditional mutants of rice (Oryza sativa). These genes encode factors involved in chloroplast rRNA regulation (NUS1), and nucleotide metabolism in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cytosol (V2 , V3, ST1). These genes are all preferentially expressed in the early leaf developmental stage P4, and depleting them causes altered chloroplast transcription and translation, and ultimately leaf chlorosis. Therefore, it is suggested that regulation of cellular nucleotide pools and nucleotide metabolism is indispensable for chloroplast development under low temperatures at this stage. This review summarizes the current understanding of these factors and discusses their roles in chloroplast biogenesis.
25219318	Aquaporins are major determinants of water use efficiency of rice plants in the field.	2014	Plant Sci	This study aimed at specifying the reasons of unbalanced water relations of rice in the field at midday which results in slowing down photosynthesis and reducing water use efficiency (WUE) in japonica and indica rice under well-watered and droughted conditions. Leaf relative water content (RWC) decreased in the well-watered plants at midday in the field, but more dramatically in the droughted indica (75.6 and 71.4%) than japonica cultivars (85.5 and 80.8%). Gas exchange was measured at three points during the day (9:00, 13:00 and 17:00). Leaf internal CO2 (Ci) was not depleted when midday stomatal depression was highest indicating that Ci was not limiting to photosynthesis. Most aquaporins were predominantly expressed in leaves suggesting higher water permeability in leaves than in roots. The expression of leaf aquaporins was further induced by drought at 9:00 without comparable responses in roots. The data suggest that aquaporin expression in the root endodermis was limiting to water uptake. Upon removal of the radial barriers to water flow in roots, transpiration increased instantly and photosynthesis increased after 4h resulting in increasing WUE after 4h, demonstrating that WUE in rice is largely limited by the inadequate aquaporin expression profiles in roots.
25142326	EF8 is involved in photoperiodic flowering pathway and chlorophyll biogenesis in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A DTH8/Ghd8 allele suppresses flowering by altering the expression patterns of the 'florigen' genes, but also negatively regulates chlorophyll biogenesis. Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait determining the growing season, regional adaptation and yield potential in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We characterized a mutant named early flowering 8 (ef8) selected from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated population of indica cultivar 93-11. It showed earlier flowering, less grains per main panicle and slightly darker green leaves than the wild-type 93-11 under natural long-day conditions, but was not significantly different from 93-11 under natural short-day conditions. We isolated the Early Flowering 8 (EF8) gene by map-based cloning. EF8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor, which is localized to the nucleus. EF8 was expressed in various tissues, especially in leaves, with a rhythmic expression pattern. Our data showed that EF8 delayed flowering time under long-day conditions by altering the rhythmic expression patterns of 'florigen' genes Hd3a and RFT1. We also found that EF8 negatively regulates the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content. Our data indicate that EF8 plays an important role in rice photoperiodic flowering pathway as well as yield potential and chlorophyll biogenesis and will be an important target for rice breeding programs.
25141278	Virus-mediated chemical changes in rice plants impact the relationship between non-vector planthopper Nilaparvata lugens Stål and its egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae Pang et Wang.	2014	PLoS One	In order to clarify the impacts of southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) infection on rice plants, rice planthoppers and natural enemies, differences in nutrients and volatile secondary metabolites between infected and healthy rice plants were examined. Furthermore, the impacts of virus-mediated changes in plants on the population growth of non-vector brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, and the selectivity and parasitic capability of planthopper egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae were studied. The results showed that rice plants had no significant changes in amino acid and soluble sugar contents after SRBSDV infection, and SRBSDV-infected plants had no significant effect on population growth of non-vector BPH. A. nilaparvatae preferred BPH eggs both in infected and healthy rice plants, and tended to parasitize eggs on infected plants, but it had no significant preference for infected plants or healthy plants. GC-MS analysis showed that tridecylic aldehyde occurred only in rice plants infected with SRBSDV, whereas octanal, undecane, methyl salicylate and hexadecane occurred only in healthy rice plants. However, in tests of behavioral responses to these five volatile substances using a Y-tube olfactometer, A. nilaparvatae did not show obvious selectivity between single volatile substances at different concentrations and liquid paraffin in the control group. The parasitic capability of A. nilaparvatae did not differ between SRBSDV-infected plants and healthy plant seedlings. The results suggested that SRBSDV-infected plants have no significant impacts on the non-vector planthopper and its egg parasitoid, A. nilaparvatae.
25177324	The role of auxin transporters in monocots development.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development, orchestrating cell division, elongation and differentiation, embryonic development, root and stem tropisms, apical dominance, and transition to flowering. Auxin levels are higher in undifferentiated cell populations and decrease following organ initiation and tissue differentiation. This differential auxin distribution is achieved by polar auxin transport (PAT) mediated by auxin transport proteins. There are four major families of auxin transporters in plants: PIN-FORMED (PIN), ATP-binding cassette family B (ABCB), AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1s, and PIN-LIKES. These families include proteins located at the plasma membrane or at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which participate in auxin influx, eﬄux or both, from the apoplast into the cell or from the cytosol into the ER compartment. Auxin transporters have been largely studied in the dicotyledon model species Arabidopsis, but there is increasing evidence of their role in auxin regulated development in monocotyledon species. In monocots, families of auxin transporters are enlarged and often include duplicated genes and proteins with high sequence similarity. Some of these proteins underwent sub- and neo-functionalization with substantial modification to their structure and expression in organs such as adventitious roots, panicles, tassels, and ears. Most of the present information on monocot auxin transporters function derives from studies conducted in rice, maize, sorghum, and Brachypodium, using pharmacological applications (PAT inhibitors) or down-/up-regulation (over-expression and RNA interference) of candidate genes. Gene expression studies and comparison of predicted protein structures have also increased our knowledge of the role of PAT in monocots. However, knockout mutants and functional characterization of single genes are still scarce and the future availability of such resources will prove crucial to elucidate the role of auxin transporters in monocots development.
25138576	Telomere-centric genome repatterning determines recurring chromosome number reductions during the evolution of eukaryotes.	2015	New Phytol	Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is central to the evolution of many eukaryotic genomes, in particular rendering angiosperm (flowering plant) genomes much less stable than those of animals. Following repeated duplication/triplication(s), angiosperm chromosome numbers have usually been restored to a narrow range, as one element in a 'diploidization' process that re-establishes diploid heredity. In several angiosperms affected by WGD, we show that chromosome number reduction (CNR) is best explained by intra- and/or inter-chromosomal crossovers to form new chromosomes that utilize the existing telomeres of 'invaded' and centromeres of 'invading' chromosomes, the alternative centromeres and telomeres being lost. Comparison with the banana (Musa acuminata) genome supports a 'fusion model' for the evolution of rice (Oryza sativa) chromosomes 2 and 3, implying that the grass common ancestor had seven chromosomes rather than the five implied by a 'fission model.' The 'invading' and 'invaded' chromosomes are frequently homoeologs, originating from duplication of a common ancestral chromosome and with greater-than-average DNA-level correspondence to one another. Telomere-centric CNR following recursive WGD in plants is also important in mammals and yeast, and may be a general mechanism of restoring small linear chromosome numbers in higher eukaryotes.
25047395	Proteomics of rice and Cochliobolus miyabeanus fungal interaction: insight into proteins at intracellular and extracellular spaces.	2014	Proteomics	Necrotrophic fungal pathogen Cochliobolus miyabeanus causes brown spot disease in rice leaves upon infection, resulting in critical rice yield loss. To better understand the rice-C. miyabeanus interaction, we employed proteomic approaches to establish differential proteomes of total and secreted proteins from the inoculated leaves. The 2DE approach after PEG-fractionation of total proteins coupled with MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF and nESI-LC-MS/MS) analyses led to identification of 49 unique proteins out of 63 differential spots. SDS-PAGE in combination with nESI-LC-MS/MS shotgun approach was applied to identify secreted proteins in the leaf apoplast upon infection and resulted in cataloging of 501 unique proteins, of which 470 and 31 proteins were secreted from rice and C. miyabeanus, respectively. Proteins mapped onto metabolic pathways implied their reprogramming upon infection. The enzymes involved in Calvin cycle and glycolysis decreased in their protein abundance, whereas enzymes in the TCA cycle, amino acids, and ethylene biosynthesis increased. Differential proteomes also generated distribution of identified proteins in the intracellular and extracellular spaces, providing a better insight into defense responses of proteins in rice against C. miyabeanus. Established proteome of the rice-C. miyabeanus interaction serves not only as a good resource for the scientific community but also highlights its significance from biological aspects.
25151634	Evidences for reduced metal-uptake and membrane injury upon application of nitric oxide donor in cadmium stressed rice seedlings.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Heavy metal Cadmium (Cd) contaminates the environment through various anthropogenic sources. Cadmium-induced productions of free radicals lead to oxidative stress and H2O2 formation in plants. Endogenous Nitric oxide (NO) acts as signal molecules in plant stress response and play a significant role in key regulatory pathways of plant development. This study investigates the effect of 50 μM exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), on roots and shoots of rice cv. HUR 3022 grown under 50 μM Cd-stress at 7 days of growth. Plants treated with Cd alone showed stunted growth, decreased length and weight, lower cell viability and less chlorophyll. An elevated lipid peroxidation complemented with more electrolyte leakage was noted. Levels of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion increased in Cd-exposed plants with corresponding increase in activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Lower chlorophyll levels paralleled with more uptake of cadmium in Cd-treatments as compared to controls. Application of equimolar amount of SNP to cadmium-stressed rice in the growth medium inhibited Cd-uptake and reversed the Cd-induced toxic effects by restoring membrane integrity. The levels of H2O2 and O2(-) were considerably recovered due to SNP treatment. The results indicate that exogenous NO diminishes the deleterious effects of Cd in rice plants.
25109872	BAC and RNA sequencing reveal the brown planthopper resistance gene BPH15 in a recombination cold spot that mediates a unique defense mechanism.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens Stål), is the most destructive phloem-feeding insect pest of rice (Oryza sativa). The BPH-resistance gene BPH15 has been proved to be effective in controlling the pest and widely applied in rice breeding programs. Nevertheless, molecular mechanism of the resistance remain unclear. In this study, we narrowed down the position of BPH15 on chromosome 4 and investigated the transcriptome of BPH15 rice after BPH attacked.

RESULTS: We analyzed 13,000 BC2F2 plants of cross between susceptible rice TN1 and the recombinant inbred line RI93 that carrying the BPH15 gene from original resistant donor B5. BPH15 was mapped to a 0.0269 cM region on chromosome 4, which is 210-kb in the reference genome of Nipponbare. Sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that span the BPH15 region revealed that the physical size of BPH15 region in resistant rice B5 is 580-kb, much bigger than the corresponding region in the reference genome of Nipponbare. There were 87 predicted genes in the BPH15 region in resistant rice. The expression profiles of predicted genes were analyzed. Four jacalin-related lectin proteins genes and one LRR protein gene were found constitutively expressed in resistant parent and considered the candidate genes of BPH15. The transcriptomes of resistant BPH15 introgression line and the susceptible recipient line were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing. In total, 2,914 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. BPH-responsive transcript profiles were distinct between resistant and susceptible plants and between the early stage (6 h after infestation, HAI) and late stage (48 HAI). The key defense mechanism was related to jasmonate signaling, ethylene signaling, receptor kinase, MAPK cascades, Ca(2+) signaling, PR genes, transcription factors, and protein posttranslational modifications.

CONCLUSIONS: Our work combined BAC and RNA sequencing to identify candidate genes of BPH15 and revealed the resistance mechanism that it mediated. These results increase our understanding of plant-insect interactions and can be used to protect against this destructive agricultural pest.
24782137	Mini review roles of the bZIP gene family in rice.	2014	Genet Mol Res	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of various biological processes. Similar to WRKY, basic helix-loop-helix, and several other groups of proteins, the bZIP proteins form a superfamily of transcription factors that mediate plant stress responses. In this review, we present the roles of bZIP proteins in multiple biological processes that include pathogen defense; responses to abiotic stresses; seed development and germination; senescence; and responses to salicylic, jasmonic, and abscisic acids in rice. We also examined the characteristics of the bZIP proteins and their genetic composition. To ascertain the evolutionary changes in and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive comparison among the 89 rice bZIP genes that were previously described and those more recently listed in the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Database using a Hidden Markov Model. We excluded 3 genes from the list, resulting in a total of 86 bZIP genes in japonica rice.
24974324	Transcriptional behavior of EUL-related rice lectins toward important abiotic and biotic stresses.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The rice genome encodes several genes for putative carbohydrate-binding proteins belonging to the family of Euonymus related lectins (EULs). This lectin family was discovered recently and evidence shows that the expression of these proteins is subject to multiple environmental stresses. In this study, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on rice seedlings exposed to various abiotic (150mM NaCl, 100mM mannitol, and 100μM abscisic acid (ABA)) and biotic (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Magnaporthe oryzae) stresses to compare the transcriptional behavior of the EULs and a known stress related lectin Orysata belonging to the family of jacalin-related lectins. All EUL transcripts were strongly up-regulated after ABA and NaCl treatments in the roots whereas the overall expression level was generally lower and more variable in the shoots. Moreover, all abiotic stresses induced Orysata in both tissues except for mannitol treatment which failed to show an effect in the roots. Orysata also strongly accumulated after X. oryzae pv. oryzae infection, as were various D-type EUL lectins. In contrast, some of the EUL proteins, including OrysaEULS3, OrysaEULD1A and OrysaEULD2, as well as Orysata were significantly down-regulated upon M. oryzae attack, suggesting fungal manipulation of these genes. Collectively, our results clearly show that rice expresses multiple carbohydrate-binding proteins in response to a wide variety of abiotic and biotic stress conditions. We hypothesize that the Euonymus related proteins fulfill a prominent role in sensing and responding to multiple environmental cues.
24698809	Role of microRNA319 in creeping bentgrass salinity and drought stress response.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	The microRNA319 family (miR319) is one of the most conserved and ancient microRNA (miRNA) families in plants. Transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing a rice miR319, Osa-miR319a, exhibited enhanced salt and drought tolerance. A comprehensive hypothetical model about the role of miR319 in creeping bentgrass response to salinity and drought stress was proposed. Salinity and drought stress induces elevated expression of miR319, resulting in downregulation of at least 4 putative target genes of miR319 (AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14) as well as a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60, and therefore positively contributing to plant abiotic stress response. Hormones might also regulate miR319 and its targets, and the expression level of the miR319 targets might be a balance of miR319-mediated target cleavage and hormone regulation of the targets. Furthermore, HKT gene families involved in salt exclusion mechanisms as well as mechanisms controlling the timing of gene expression network are also hypothesized to play an important role in this pathway.
24780313	Functional and molecular characterization of plastid terminal oxidase from rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Biochim Biophys Acta	The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) is a plastohydroquinone:oxygen oxidoreductase that shares structural similarities with alternative oxidases (AOX). Multiple roles have been attributed to PTOX, such as involvement in carotene desaturation, a safety valve function, participation in the processes of chlororespiration and setting the redox poise for cyclic electron transport. We have investigated a homogenously pure MBP fusion of PTOX. The protein forms a homo-tetrameric complex containing 2 Fe per monomer and is very specific for the plastoquinone head-group. The reaction kinetics were investigated in a soluble monophasic system using chemically reduced decyl-plastoquinone (DPQ) as the model substrate and, in addition, in a biphasic (liposomal) system in which DPQ was reduced with DT-diaphorase. While PTOX did not detectably produce reactive oxygen species in the monophasic system, their formation was observed by room temperature EPR in the biphasic system in a [DPQH₂] and pH-dependent manner. This is probably the result of the higher concentration of DPQ achieved within the partial volume of the lipid bilayer and a higher Km observed with PTOX-membrane associates which is ≈47mM compared to the monophasic system where a Km of ≈74μM was determined. With liposomes and at the basic stromal pH of photosynthetically active chloroplasts, PTOX was antioxidant at low [DPQH₂] gaining prooxidant properties with increasing quinol concentrations. It is concluded that in vivo, PTOX can act as a safety valve when the steady state [PQH₂] is low while a certain amount of ROS is formed at high light intensities.
24754628	Ectopic phytocystatin expression leads to enhanced drought stress tolerance in soybean (Glycine max) and Arabidopsis thaliana through effects on strigolactone pathways and can also result in improved seed traits.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Ectopic cystatin expression has long been used in plant pest management, but the cysteine protease, targets of these inhibitors, might also have important functions in the control of plant lifespan and stress tolerance that remain poorly characterized. We therefore characterized the effects of expression of the rice cystatin, oryzacystatin-I (OCI), on the growth, development and stress tolerance of crop (soybean) and model (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Ectopic OCI expression in soybean enhanced shoot branching and leaf chlorophyll accumulation at later stages of vegetative development and enhanced seed protein contents and decreased the abundance of mRNAs encoding strigolactone synthesis enzymes. The OCI-expressing A. thaliana showed a slow-growth phenotype, with increased leaf numbers and enhanced shoot branching at flowering. The OCI-dependent inhibition of cysteine proteases enhanced drought tolerance in soybean and A. thaliana, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation being much less sensitive to drought-induced inhibition in the OCI-expressing soybean lines. Ectopic OCI expression or treatment with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 increased lateral root densities in A. thaliana. E64 treatment also increased lateral root densities in the max2-1 mutants that are defective in strigolactone signalling, but not in the max3-9 mutants that are defective in strigolactone synthesis. Taken together, these data provide evidence that OCI-inhibited cysteine proteases participate in the control of growth and stress tolerance through effects on strigolactones. We conclude that cysteine proteases are important targets for manipulation of plant growth, development and stress tolerance, and also seed quality traits.
24771021	Natural variation and genetic analysis of the tiller angle gene MsTAC1 in Miscanthus sinensis.	2014	Planta	Biomass yield is an important target trait in Miscanthus breeding for desirable energy crops. Tiller angle is a key trait of plant architecture because it determines planting density and further influences biomass yield through affecting photosynthesis efficiency. TAC1, a major gene involved in tiller and leaf angle control in rice and maize, respectively, has been extensively studied. Nucleotide variation at this gene, MsTAC1, was investigated in 33 Miscanthus sinensis accessions collected from different areas in China, and one genotype of Miscanthus × giganteus. A total of 136 loci, including 129 single base substitutions and seven InDels, occurred within the MsTAC1 gene of 1,874 bp. The genetic diversity at MsTAC1 is characterized by high nucleotide diversity (π value) and high heterozygosity. Clustering analysis indicated that the phylogenetic tree of the 33 M. sinensis accessions was correlated with their geographical sites of origin. The neutrality test revealed no strong selection pressure on coding and non-coding region variations of the MsTAC1 gene in the accessions. Phenotype evaluations were conducted for tiller angle and five other traits in the Miscanthus panels in the first two growth years of 2009 and 2010. Analysis of variance showed significant phenotypic variations in the examined traits. Association analysis using 246 markers detected 88 loci associated with all the test traits in either 1 or 2 years, and 11 of the 88 were year reproducible and thus reliable. These associations indicate that the variation of MsTAC1 affects the phenotypic value of the tiller angle, tiller number and biomass yield, suggesting that allelic variation in MsTAC1 affects multiple traits and demonstrates its significance in Miscanthus breeding programs.
25011296	[Characteristics of distribution and transportation of rice genotype with high nitrogen utilization efficiency at the late growth stage].	2014	Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao	Taking a high nitrogen utilization efficiency rice genotype (NUE(H)) as test material and a low nitrogen utilization efficiency genotype (NUE(L)) as control, a pot experiment was carried out with nitrogen treatments of 100 (low) and 200 mg x kg(-1) (normal), to analyze the differences in nitrogen accumulation distribution, translocation and transport efficiency between the two genotypes. The results showed that NUE(H) could still maintain a high yield and a high nitrogen utilization efficiency at the low rate of nitrogen fertilization, with the grain yield being 1.75 times of that of NUE(L), and the nitrogen recovery efficiency of 50.9% compared with 36.4% for NUE(L). Compared to the normal nitrogen fertilization rate, the low nitrogen fertilization rate promoted the nitrogen accumulation by 34.2%, 2.5% and 0.5% in NUE(H) at the flowering, filling and mature stages, while decreased by 23.5% and 15.6% in NUE(L) at filling and mature stages, respectively. Nitrogen accumulation distribution in organs of NUE(H) was in the order of leaf > stem > root > spike, spike > leaf > stem > root, and spike > stem > leaf > root at the flowering, filling and mature stages, respectively. With the advancement of growth period, the nitrogen accumulation in spike increased obviously. At the two nitrogen fertilization rates, nitrogen transfer was ordered as leaf > stem > root for NUE(H), and stem > leaf > root for NUE(L), and nitrogen transfer efficiencies of NUE(H) were 50.8%, 60.3%, which were as 1.67 and 1.55 times as that of NUE(L), respectively. It could be concluded that the higher nitrogen transport efficiency of NUE(H) leaves laid a good foundation for the construction of grain after heading.
24740395	Nitrite promotes the growth and decreases the lignin content of indica rice calli: a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of nitrite-responsive genes during in vitro culture of rice.	2014	PLoS One	As both major macronutrients and signal molecules, nitrogen metabolites, such as nitrate and nitrite, play an important role in plant growth and development. In this study, the callus growth of indica rice cv. 9311 was significantly enhanced by nitrite, whereas the soluble protein content remained unchanged. The deep RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) showed that the transcriptional profiles of cv. 9311 calli were significantly changed after adding nitrite to the nitrate-free medium, and these nitrite-responsive genes were involved in a wide range of plant processes, particularly in the secondary metabolite pathways. Interestingly, most of the genes involved in phenylpropanoid-related pathways were coordinately down-regulated by nitrite, such as four cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, and these in turn resulted in the decrease of lignin content of indica calli. Furthermore, several candidate genes related to cell growth or stress responses were identified, such as genes coding for expansins, SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) and HSP20s, and these suggested that nitrite could probably serve as a transcriptome signal to enhance the indica calli growth by regulation of various downstream genes expression. This study contributes to a better understanding of the function of nitrite during the process of plant tissue culture and could aid in the application of this technology to improved indica genetic transformation efficiency.
24746721	Purification and characterization of antifungal phenazines from a fluorescent Pseudomonas strain FPO4 against medically important fungi.	2014	J Mycol Med	The strain FPO4 was isolated from the rhizoplane of rice plant root and identified as a fluorescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences and BLAST analysis. The extracellular metabolites produced by this strain were purified by silica gel column chromatography and isolated four pure compounds. Based on the spectral data the four compounds were identified as phenazin-1-ol, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxyl-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), and phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), respectively. Phenazin-1-ol and PCA were active against all the eight fungi tested. The highest activity of 4 μg/mL by PCA was recorded against Trichophyton rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, ringworm and fingernail fungus infections, followed by Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. The activity of phenazin-1-ol, PCA against Candida spp. was found to be better than the standard antifungal agent amphotericin B. Furthermore, the present study reports the antimicrobial activity of the purified phenazines on major human pathogen, T. rubrum for the first time.
24721692	Disentangling methodological and biological sources of gene tree discordance on Oryza (Poaceae) chromosome 3.	2014	Syst Biol	We describe new methods for characterizing gene tree discordance in phylogenomic data sets, which screen for deviations from neutral expectations, summarize variation in statistical support among gene trees, and allow comparison of the patterns of discordance induced by various analysis choices. Using an exceptionally complete set of genome sequences for the short arm of chromosome 3 in Oryza (rice) species, we applied these methods to identify the causes and consequences of differing patterns of discordance in the sets of gene trees inferred using a panel of 20 distinct analysis pipelines. We found that discordance patterns were strongly affected by aspects of data selection, alignment, and alignment masking. Unusual patterns of discordance evident when using certain pipelines were reduced or eliminated by using alternative pipelines, suggesting that they were the product of methodological biases rather than evolutionary processes. In some cases, once such biases were eliminated, evolutionary processes such as introgression could be implicated. Additionally, patterns of gene tree discordance had significant downstream impacts on species tree inference. For example, inference from supermatrices was positively misleading when pipelines that led to biased gene trees were used. Several results may generalize to other data sets: we found that gene tree and species tree inference gave more reasonable results when intron sequence was included during sequence alignment and tree inference, the alignment software PRANK was used, and detectable "block-shift" alignment artifacts were removed. We discuss our findings in the context of well-established relationships in Oryza and continuing controversies regarding the domestication history of O. sativa.
24832615	Fine mapping of the lesion mimic and early senescence 1 (lmes1) in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	A novel rice mutant, lesion mimic and early senescence 1 (lmes1), was induced from the rice 93-11 cultivar in a γ-ray field. This mutant exhibited spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack at the beginning of the tillering stage. Moreover, at the booting stage, lmes1 mutants exhibited a significantly increased MDA but decreased chlorophyll content, soluble protein content and photosynthetic rate in the leaves, which are indicative of an early senescence phenotype. The lmes1 mutant was significantly more resistant than 93-11 against rice bacterial blight infection, which was consistent with a marked increase in the expression of three resistance-related genes. Here, we employed a map-based cloning approach to finely map the lmes1 gene. In an initial mapping with 94 F2 individuals derived from a cross between the lmes1 mutant and Nipponbare, the lmes1 gene was located in a 10.6-cM region on the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 7 using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. To finely map lmes1, we derived two F2 populations with 940 individuals from two crosses between the lmes1 mutant and two japonica rice varieties, Nipponbare and 02428. Finally, the lmes1 gene was mapped to an 88-kb region between two newly developed inDel markers, Zl-3 and Zl-22, which harbored 15 ORFs.
24723407	Over-expression of the Arabidopsis proton-pyrophosphatase AVP1 enhances transplant survival, root mass, and fruit development under limiting phosphorus conditions.	2014	J Exp Bot	Phosphorus (P), an element required for plant growth, fruit set, fruit development, and fruit ripening, can be deficient or unavailable in agricultural soils. Previously, it was shown that over-expression of a proton-pyrophosphatase gene AVP1/AVP1D (AVP1DOX) in Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato resulted in the enhancement of root branching and overall mass with the result of increased mineral P acquisition. However, although AVP1 over-expression also increased shoot biomass in Arabidopsis, this effect was not observed in tomato under phosphate-sufficient conditions. AVP1DOX tomato plants exhibited increased rootward auxin transport and root acidification compared with control plants. AVP1DOX tomato plants were analysed in detail under limiting P conditions in greenhouse and field trials. AVP1DOX plants produced 25% (P=0.001) more marketable ripened fruit per plant under P-deficient conditions compared with the controls. Further, under low phosphate conditions, AVP1DOX plants displayed increased phosphate transport from leaf (source) to fruit (sink) compared to controls. AVP1DOX plants also showed an 11% increase in transplant survival (P<0.01) in both greenhouse and field trials compared with the control plants. These results suggest that selection of tomato cultivars for increased proton pyrophosphatase gene expression could be useful when selecting for cultivars to be grown on marginal soils.
24771344	Identification of non-coding RNAs with a new composite feature in the Hybrid Random Forest Ensemble algorithm.	2014	Nucleic Acids Res	To identify non-coding RNA (ncRNA) signals within genomic regions, a classification tool was developed based on a hybrid random forest (RF) with a logistic regression model to efficiently discriminate short ncRNA sequences as well as long complex ncRNA sequences. This RF-based classifier was trained on a well-balanced dataset with a discriminative set of features and achieved an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 92.11%, 90.7% and 93.5%, respectively. The selected feature set includes a new proposed feature, SCORE. This feature is generated based on a logistic regression function that combines five significant features-structure, sequence, modularity, structural robustness and coding potential-to enable improved characterization of long ncRNA (lncRNA) elements. The use of SCORE improved the performance of the RF-based classifier in the identification of Rfam lncRNA families. A genome-wide ncRNA classification framework was applied to a wide variety of organisms, with an emphasis on those of economic, social, public health, environmental and agricultural significance, such as various bacteria genomes, the Arthrospira (Spirulina) genome, and rice and human genomic regions. Our framework was able to identify known ncRNAs with sensitivities of greater than 90% and 77.7% for prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences, respectively. Our classifier is available at http://ncrna-pred.com/HLRF.htm.
24786093	Characterisation of Indica Special Protein (ISP), a marker protein for the differentiation of Oryza sativa subspecies indica and japonica.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	Based on both morphological and physiological traits, Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) can be classified into two distinct subspecies, indica and japonica. To better understand the differences between the two subspecies, a proteomic approach was used to profile proteins present in the yellow seedling stage of 10 indica and 10 japonica rice varieties. We report the discovery of a new protein, Indica Special Protein (ISP), which was only detected in yellow seedlings of indica varieties, and was absent from japonica varieties. Hence, ISP may represent a key gene for the differentiation of indica and japonica subspecies.
25079420	Arsenic dynamics in the rhizosphere and its sequestration on rice roots as affected by root oxidation.	2014	J Environ Sci (China)	A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of root oxidation on arsenic (As) dynamics in the rhizosphere and As sequestration on rice roots. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in pH values between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, with pH 5.68-6.16 in the rhizosphere and 6.30-6.37 in non-rhizosphere soils as well as differences in redox potentials (P < 0.05). Percentage arsenite was lower (4%-16%) in rhizosphere soil solutions from rice genotypes with higher radial oxygen loss (ROL) compared with genotypes with lower ROL (P < 0.05). Arsenic concentrations in iron plaque and rice straw were significantly negatively correlated (R = -0.60, P < 0.05). Genotypes with higher ROL (TD71 and Yinjingruanzhan) had significantly (P < 0.001) lower total As in rice grains (1.35 and 0.96 mg/kg, respectively) compared with genotypes with lower ROL (IAPAR9, 1.68 mg/kg; Nanyangzhan 2.24 mg/kg) in the As treatment, as well as lower inorganic As (P < 0.05). The present study showed that genotypes with higher ROL could oxidize more arsenite in rhizosphere soils, and induce more Fe plaque formation, which subsequently sequestered more As. This reduced As uptake in aboveground plant tissues and also reduced inorganic As accumulation in rice grains. The study has contributed to further understanding the mechanisms whereby ROL influences As uptake and accumulation in rice.
24722991	Diversity in guanosine 3',5'-bisdiphosphate (ppGpp) sensitivity among guanylate kinases of bacteria and plants.	2014	J Biol Chem	The guanosine 3',5'-bisdiphosphate (ppGpp) signaling system is shared by bacteria and plant chloroplasts, but its role in plants has remained unclear. Here we show that guanylate kinase (GK), a key enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis that catalyzes the conversion of GMP to GDP, is a target of regulation by ppGpp in chloroplasts of rice, pea, and Arabidopsis. Plants have two distinct types of GK that are localized to organelles (GKpm) or to the cytosol (GKc), with both enzymes being essential for growth and development. We found that the activity of rice GKpm in vitro was inhibited by ppGpp with a Ki of 2.8 μM relative to the substrate GMP, whereas the Km of this enzyme for GMP was 73 μM. The IC50 of ppGpp for GKpm was ∼10 μM. In contrast, the activity of rice GKc was insensitive to ppGpp, as was that of GK from bakers' yeast, which is also a cytosolic enzyme. These observations suggest that ppGpp plays a pivotal role in the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts through specific inhibition of GKpm activity, with the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts thus being independent of that in the cytosol. We also found that GKs of Escherichia coli and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 are insensitive to ppGpp, in contrast to the ppGpp sensitivity of the Bacillus subtilis enzyme. Our biochemical characterization of GK enzymes has thus revealed a novel target of ppGpp in chloroplasts and has uncovered diversity among bacterial GKs with regard to regulation by ppGpp.
24766995	Comparative mapping of chalkiness components in rice using five populations across two environments.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Chalkiness is a major constraint in rice production because it is one of the key factors determining grain quality (appearance, processing, milling, storing, eating, and cooking quality) and price. Its reduction is a major goal, and the primary purpose of this study was to dissect the genetic basis of grain chalkiness. Using five populations across two environments, we also sought to determine how many quantitative trait loci (QTL) can be consistently detected. We obtained an integrated genetic map using the data from five mapping populations and further confirmed the reliability of the identified QTL.

RESULTS: A total of 79 QTL associated with six chalkiness traits (chalkiness rate, white core rate, white belly rate, chalkiness area, white core area, and white belly area) were mapped on 12 chromosomes using five populations (two doubled haploid lines and three recombinant inbred lines) across two environments (Hainan in 2004 and Wuhan in 2004). The final integrated map included 430 markers; 58.3% of the QTL clustered together (QTL clusters), 71.4% of the QTL clusters were identified in two or more populations, and 36.1% of the QTL were consistently detected in the two environments. The QTL could be detected again and showed dominance (qWBR1, qWBR8, qWBR12, and qCR5) or overdominance effects (qWCR7) for the rate of the white belly or white core, respectively, and all four QTL clusters derived from Zhenshan 97 controlling white belly rate were stably and reliably identified in an F2 population.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified 79 QTL associated with six chalkiness traits using five populations across two environments and yielded an integrated genetic map, indicating most of the QTL clustered together and could be detected in different backgrounds. The identified QTL were stable and reliable in the F2 population, and they may facilitate our understanding of the QTL related to chalkiness traits in different populations and various environments, the relationships among the various chalkiness QTL, and the genetic basis for chalkiness. Thus, our results may be immediately used for map-based cloning of important QTL and in marker-assisted breeding to improve grain quality in rice breeding.
24711357	Improved yield and Zn accumulation for rice grain by Zn fertilization and optimized water management.	2014	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Zinc (Zn) deficiency and water scarcity are major challenges in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under an intensive rice production system. This study aims to investigate the impact of water-saving management and different Zn fertilization source (ZnSO4 and Zn-EDTA) regimes on grain yield and Zn accumulation in rice grain. Different water managements, continuous flooding (CF), and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) were applied during the rice growing season. Compared with CF, the AWD regime significantly increased grain yield and Zn concentrations in both brown rice and polished rice. Grain yield of genotypes (Nipponbare and Jiaxing27), on the average, was increased by 11.4%, and grain Zn concentration by 3.9% when compared with those under a CF regime. Zn fertilization significantly increased Zn density in polished rice, with a more pronounced effect of ZnSO4 being observed as compared with Zn-EDTA, especially under an AWD regime. Decreased phytic acid content and molar ratio of phytic acid to Zn were also noted in rice grains with Zn fertilization. The above results demonstrated that water management of AWD combined with ZnSO4 fertilization was an effective agricultural practice to elevate grain yield and increase Zn accumulation and bioavailability in rice grains.
24720629	Soybean (Glycine max) expansin gene superfamily origins: segmental and tandem duplication events followed by divergent selection among subfamilies.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Expansins are plant cell wall loosening proteins that are involved in cell enlargement and a variety of other developmental processes. The expansin superfamily contains four subfamilies; namely, α-expansin (EXPA), β-expansin (EXPB), expansin-like A (EXLA), and expansin-like B (EXLB). Although the genome sequencing of soybeans is complete, our knowledge about the pattern of expansion and evolutionary history of soybean expansin genes remains limited.

RESULTS: A total of 75 expansin genes were identified in the soybean genome, and grouped into four subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships. Structural analysis revealed that the expansin genes are conserved in each subfamily, but are divergent among subfamilies. Furthermore, in soybean and Arabidopsis, the expansin gene family has been mainly expanded through tandem and segmental duplications; however, in rice, segmental duplication appears to be the dominant process that generates this superfamily. The transcriptome atlas revealed notable differential expression in either transcript abundance or expression patterns under normal growth conditions. This finding was consistent with the differential distribution of the cis-elements in the promoter region, and indicated wide functional divergence in this superfamily. Moreover, some critical amino acids that contribute to functional divergence and positive selection were detected. Finally, site model and branch-site model analysis of positive selection indicated that the soybean expansin gene superfamily is under strong positive selection, and that divergent selection constraints might have influenced the evolution of the four subfamilies.

CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the soybean expansin gene superfamily has expanded through tandem and segmental duplication. Differential expression indicated wide functional divergence in this superfamily. Furthermore, positive selection analysis revealed that divergent selection constraints might have influenced the evolution of the four subfamilies. In conclusion, the results of this study contribute novel detailed information about the molecular evolution of the expansin gene superfamily in soybean.
24706213	Mannosylerythritol lipids secreted by phyllosphere yeast Pseudozyma antarctica is associated with its filamentous growth and propagation on plant surfaces.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The biological function of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) towards their producer, Pseudozyma antarctica, on plant surfaces was investigated. MEL-producing wild-type strain and its MEL production-defective mutant strain (ΔPaEMT1) were compared in terms of their phenotypic traits on the surface of plastic plates, onion peels, and fresh leaves of rice and wheat. While wild-type cells adhering on plastic surfaces and onion peels changed morphologically from single cells to elongated ones for a short period of about 4 h and 1 day, respectively, ΔPaEMT1 cells did not. Microscopic observation of both strains grown on plant leaf surfaces verified that the wild type colonized a significantly bigger area than that of ΔPaEMT1. However, when MELs were exogenously added to the mutant cells on plant surfaces, their colonized area became enlarged. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a secretion of higher amount of MELs in the cell suspension incubated with wheat leaf cuttings compared to that in the suspension without cuttings. Transcriptional analysis by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR verified that the expression of erythritol/mannose transferase gene and MELs transporter gene of P. antarctica increased in the cells inoculated onto wheat leaves at 4, 6, and 8 days of incubation, indicating a potential of P. antarctica to produce MELs on the leaves. These findings demonstrate that MELs produced by P. antarctica on plant surfaces could be expected to play a significant role in fungal morphological development and propagation on plant surfaces.
24744320	Draft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces sp. Strain PRh5, a Novel Endophytic Actinomycete Isolated from Dongxiang Wild Rice Root.	2014	Genome Announc	Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. strain PRh5 (China Center for Type Culture Collection [CCTCC] number 2013487), which is used to produce nigericin and nocardamine. The genome sequence will allow for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial properties.
24696519	High-Resolution Inflorescence Phenotyping Using a Novel Image-Analysis Pipeline, PANorama.	2014	Plant Physiol	Variation in inflorescence development is an important target of selection for numerous crop species, including many members of the Poaceae (grasses). In Asian rice (Oryza sativa), inflorescence (panicle) architecture is correlated with yield and grain-quality traits. However, many rice breeders continue to use composite phenotypes in selection pipelines, because measuring complex, branched panicles requires a significant investment of resources. We developed an open-source phenotyping platform, PANorama, which measures multiple architectural and branching phenotypes from images simultaneously. PANorama automatically extracts skeletons from images, allows users to subdivide axes into individual internodes, and thresholds away structures, such as awns, that normally interfere with accurate panicle phenotyping. PANorama represents an improvement in both efficiency and accuracy over existing panicle imaging platforms, and flexible implementation makes PANorama capable of measuring a range of organs from other plant species. Using high-resolution phenotypes, a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines, and a dense single-nucleotide polymorphism data set, we identify, to our knowledge, the largest number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for panicle traits ever reported in a single study. Several areas of the genome show pleiotropic clusters of panicle QTLs, including a region near the rice Green Revolution gene SEMIDWARF1. We also confirm that multiple panicle phenotypes are distinctly different among a small collection of diverse rice varieties. Taken together, these results suggest that clusters of small-effect QTLs may be responsible for varietal or subpopulation-specific panicle traits, representing a significant opportunity for rice breeders selecting for yield performance across different genetic backgrounds.
24717398	Assessment of the quality of bran and bran oil produced from some Egyptian rice varieties.	2014	J Egypt Public Health Assoc	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the leading food crops of the world, the staple food of over half the world's population. The bran, which is an important byproduct obtained during rice milling, constitutes about 1/10 of the weight of the rice grain. Rice bran is the outer brown layer including the rice germ that is removed during the milling process of brown grain. This milling byproduct is reported to be high in natural vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin E.

OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to determine the chemical composition of bran and bran oil of 13 different rice varieties commonly produced in Egypt, to study the utilization of rice bran in bread production, and to assess the quality and acceptance of the rice bran edible oil produced.

METHODS: Rice bran was produced from 13 Egyptian varieties of recently harvested rice as well as from paddy rice stored for 1 year. The extracted bran was immediately stabilized then subjected to chemical analysis (such as moisture content, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and ash) as well as trace and heavy metals determination (P, K, Na, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mg). Bread was produced by adding Giza172 rice bran at three different concentrations to wheat flour then subjected to chemical analysis, caloric content, and organoleptic examination. Bran oil was extracted from the different varieties of rice bran (recently harvested and stored) then subjected to chemical and organoleptic examinations as well as vitamin E and oryzanol determination.

RESULTS: The percentage of rice bran of newly harvested Egyptian rice was 11.68% and was 10.97% in stored rice. The analysis showed mean values of 5.91 and 5.53% for moisture, 14.60 and 14.40% for crude protein, 14.83 and 15.20% for fat, 44.77 and 45.40% for carbohydrates, 6.55 and 7.06% for crude fiber, and 8.87 and 8.50% for ash for newly harvested and stored rice bran, respectively. Bread containing 15% rice bran showed the highest score percentages for organoleptic quality compared with the control (100% wheat flour). Rice bran oil showed higher scores of taste, smell, appearance, and texture than corn oil and sunflower oil.

CONCLUSION: Rice bran contains high nutritional components as well as phytochemicals such as vitamin E (i.e. tocopherols and tocotrienols) and the γ-oryzanol fraction that have positive effects on human health. Storage of paddy rice before milling resulted in significant effect on all studied rice bran characters and rice bran oil characters under the present investigation except crude protein and carbohydrates characters.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Substitution of wheat flour with rice bran by 15% in bread production to fortify the bread with vitamin E and to reduce the amount of imported flour is recommended.
24915087	Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of defective pollen wall (DPW) protein from Oryza sativa.	2014	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	The defective pollen wall (dpw) gene of Oryza sativa encodes a fatty acid reductase (DPW) which plays important roles in primary fatty alcohol synthesis. DPW catalyzes the synthesis of 1-hexadecanol. The enzyme shows a higher specificity for palmitoyl-ACP than for palmitoyl-CoA as the substrate, and can only use NADPH as the cofactor. To gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the reaction catalyzed by DPW, the gene encoding DPW without the N-terminal 80 amino acids (DPWΔ80) was cloned into pET-28a vector and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. DPWΔ80 was purified to homogeneity and screened for crystallization. DPWΔ80 in complex with NADPH produced crystals that diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 3.4 Å. The crystals belonged to space group P6₁ or P6₅, with unit-cell parameters a=b=222.8, c=114.0 Å, α=β=90, γ=120°.
24907524	Beneficial rhizobacteria from rice rhizosphere confers high protection against biotic and abiotic stress inducing systemic resistance in rice seedlings.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	The present study reports a screening for PGPR in a highly selective environment, the rhizosphere of rice plants, in southwestern of Spain. Among the 900 isolates, only 38% were positive for at least one of the biochemical activities to detect putative PGPR. The best 80 isolates were selected and identified by 16S rRNA partial sequencing. Among these, 13 strains were selected for growth promotion assays. Only one strain (BaC1-38) was able to significantly increase height, while nine strains significantly inhibited it. Five strains significantly increased dry weight, and only BaC1-21 significantly decreased it. Based on significant modifications in growth, three bacteria (BaC1-13, BaC1-21 and BaC1-38) were tested for systemic induction of resistance against stress challenge (salt and Xanthomonas campestris infection). Protection against salt stress and pathogen infection was similar; BaC1-38 protected by 80%, BaC1-13 by 50% and BaC1-21 only by 20%. Toxicity of salt stress to the plants was evaluated by photosynthetic efficiency of seedlings. Fv/Fm only decreased significantly in plants inoculated with BaC1-13. ΦPSII also decreased significantly in plants inoculated with BaC1-21, but increased significantly with BaC1-38. NPQ decreased significantly in plants inoculated with BaC1-21. The two strains able to induce systemic resistance against Xanthomonas campestris seem to work by different pathways. BaC1-13 primed enzymes related with the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, BaC1-38 primed pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs), and this pathway was more effective, both improved chlorophyll index confirming the priming state of the plant.
24884676	Genome-wide identification of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and Hsp interactors in rice: Hsp70s as a case study.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) perform a fundamental role in protecting plants against abiotic stresses. Although researchers have made great efforts on the functional analysis of individual family members, Hsps have not been fully characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and little is known about their interactors.

RESULTS: In this study, we combined orthology-based approach with expression association data to screen rice Hsps for the expression patterns of which strongly correlated with that of heat responsive probe-sets. Twenty-seven Hsp candidates were identified, including 12 small Hsps, six Hsp70s, three Hsp60s, three Hsp90s, and three clpB/Hsp100s. Then, using a combination of interolog and expression profile-based methods, we inferred 430 interactors of Hsp70s in rice, and validated the interactions by co-localization and function-based methods. Subsequent analysis showed 13 interacting domains and 28 target motifs were over-represented in Hsp70s interactors. Twenty-four GO terms of biological processes and five GO terms of molecular functions were enriched in the positive interactors, whose expression levels were positively associated with Hsp70s. Hsp70s interaction network implied that Hsp70s were involved in macromolecular translocation, carbohydrate metabolism, innate immunity, photosystem II repair and regulation of kinase activities.

CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-seven Hsps in rice were identified and 430 interactors of Hsp70s were inferred and validated, then the interacting network of Hsp70s was induced and the function of Hsp70s was analyzed. Furthermore, two databases named Rice Heat Shock Proteins (RiceHsps) and Rice Gene Expression Profile (RGEP), and one online tool named Protein-Protein Interaction Predictor (PPIP), were constructed and could be accessed at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/.
24852592	Genome-wide nucleosome positioning is orchestrated by genomic regions associated with DNase I hypersensitivity in rice.	2014	PLoS Genet	Nucleosome positioning dictates the DNA accessibility for regulatory proteins, and thus is critical for gene expression and regulation. It has been well documented that only a subset of nucleosomes are reproducibly positioned in eukaryotic genomes. The most prominent example of phased nucleosomes is the context of genes, where phased nucleosomes flank the transcriptional starts sites (TSSs). It is unclear, however, what factors determine nucleosome positioning in regions that are not close to genes. We mapped both nucleosome positioning and DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) datasets across the rice genome. We discovered that DHSs located in a variety of contexts, both genic and intergenic, were flanked by strongly phased nucleosome arrays. Phased nucleosomes were also found to flank DHSs in the human genome. Our results suggest the barrier model may represent a general feature of nucleosome organization in eukaryote genomes. Specifically, regions bound with regulatory proteins, including intergenic regions, can serve as barriers that organize phased nucleosome arrays on both sides. Our results also suggest that rice DHSs often span a single, phased nucleosome, similar to the H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes observed in DHSs in the human genome.
24800811	Comparative functional analysis of wheat (Triticum aestivum) zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins in response to abiotic stresses.	2014	PLoS One	Although the functional roles of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (RZs) have been characterized in several plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), the physiological functions of RZs in wheat (Triticum aestivum) remain largely unknown. Here, the functional roles of the three wheat RZ family members, named TaRZ1, TaRZ2, and TaRZ3, were investigated using transgenic Arabidopsis plants under various abiotic stress conditions. Expression of TaRZs was markedly regulated by salt, dehydration, or cold stress. The TaRZ1 and TaRZ3 proteins were localized to the nucleus, whereas the TaRZ2 protein was localized to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasm. Germination of all three TaRZ-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis seeds was retarded compared with that of wild-type seeds under salt stress conditions, whereas germination of TaRZ2- or TaRZ3-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis seeds was retarded under dehydration stress conditions. Seedling growth of TaRZ1-expressing transgenic plants was severely inhibited under cold or salt stress conditions, and seedling growth of TaRZ2-expressing plants was inhibited under salt stress conditions. By contrast, expression of TaRZ3 did not affect seedling growth of transgenic plants under any of the stress conditions. In addition, expression of TaRZ2 conferred freeze tolerance in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these results suggest that different TaRZ family members play various roles in seed germination, seedling growth, and freeze tolerance in plants under abiotic stress.
24793751	Gel-based comparative phosphoproteomic analysis on rice embryo during germination.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Seed germination is a well regulated process, which incorporates many events including signal transduction, mobilization of reserves, reactive oxygen species scavenging and cell division. Although many transcriptomic and proteomic studies have been conducted on this process, regulation of protein modification has not been studied. To better understand the mechanism, a gel-based comparative phosphoproteomic study was performed on rice embryo during the germination process. In total, 168 protein spots exhibited significantly changed Pro-Q staining intensity during germination. Using matrix-assisted laser deionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis, 193 proteins were identified. By combining Pro-Q and Coomassie brilliant blue stain intensity analyses, 109 proteins were verified to be phosphorylation regulation proteins. Functional analyses indicated that phosphorylation of proteins involved in stress response and storage was gradually enhanced. Phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins was mainly activated during the early stage of germination, while stress response and storage protein phosphorylation were enhanced at the late stage. Enzyme assays proved that the phosphorylation of fructokinase, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase1, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase could consistently enhance their activity. This study showed the dynamic changes of protein phosphorylation status in rice embryo during germination and provided new insight into understanding the mechanism underlying this process.
25055689	[Input and distribution of rice photosynthesized carbon in the tillering stage under different nitrogen application following continuous 13C labeling].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The input of rice-photosynthesized carbon (C) into soil plays an important role in soil C cycling. A 13C-labelled microcosm experiment was carried out to quantify the input of photosynthesized C into soil C pools in a rice-soil system during the tillering stage. Growing rice (Oryza sativa L. ) was continuously fed with 13C-labeled CO, ( C-CO, ) in a closed chamber without nitrogen (NO), or at different rates of N supply (N10,N20, N30, N40 or N60). The results showed that there were significant differences in rice shoot (1.58 g plot-1 to 4.35 g plot-1) and root (1.05 g plot-1 to 2.44 g plot-1 ) biomass among the N treatments after labeling for 18 days. The amounts of 13C in shoots and roots ranged from 44.0 g plot-1 to 157.6 g.plot-1 and 8.3 g.plot-1 to 49.4 g.plot-1, respectively, and generally followed the order of N60 > N40 > N20 > N10 > NO. The contents of rice-planted 13C-SOC, 13C-DOC and 13C-MBC in soil carbon pool were much higher than those of CK (without rice and N supply). The amount of 13C-SOC ranged from 11.1 g plot - to 23.7 gplot-1 , depending on the rate of N addition, accounting for 10.2% -18. 1% of the net assimilation. The amounts of 13C-DOC and 13C-MBC ranged from 4. 82-14.51 microg kg-1 and 526. 1-1 478.8 microg kg-1 , both depending on the N application rate. In addition, at 18-day of labeling, the 13C-SOC, 13C-DOC and 13C-MBC concentration was positively correlated with the rice biomass. Therefore, our results suggest that paddy soils can probably sequester more C from the atmosphere if more photosynthesized C enters the soils and N application can stimulate C rhizodeposition during the tillering stage.
24885077	Comparative genomic analysis of the R2R3 MYB secondary cell wall regulators of Arabidopsis, poplar, rice, maize, and switchgrass.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: R2R3 MYB proteins constitute one of the largest plant transcription factor clades and regulate diverse plant-specific processes. Several R2R3 MYB proteins act as regulators of secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (At), a dicotyledenous plant. Relatively few studies have examined SCW R2R3 MYB function in grasses, which may have diverged from dicots in terms of SCW regulatory mechanisms, as they have in cell wall composition and patterning. Understanding cell wall regulation is especially important for improving lignocellulosic bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass.

RESULTS: Here, we describe the results of applying phylogenic, OrthoMCL, and sequence identity analyses to classify the R2R3 MYB family proteins from the annotated proteomes of Arabidposis, poplar, rice, maize and the initial genome (v0.0) and translated transcriptome of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We find that the R2R3 MYB proteins of the five species fall into 48 subgroups, including three dicot-specific, six grass-specific, and two panicoid grass-expanded subgroups. We observe four classes of phylogenetic relationships within the subgroups of known SCW-regulating MYB proteins between Arabidopsis and rice, ranging from likely one-to-one orthology (for AtMYB26, AtMYB103, AtMYB69) to no homologs identifiable (for AtMYB75). Microarray data for putative switchgrass SCW MYBs indicate that many maintain similar expression patterns with the Arabidopsis SCW regulators. However, some of the switchgrass-expanded candidate SCW MYBs exhibit differences in gene expression patterns among paralogs, consistent with subfunctionalization. Furthermore, some switchgrass representatives of grass-expanded clades have gene expression patterns consistent with regulating SCW development.

CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that no single comparative genomics tool is able to provide a complete picture of the R2R3 MYB protein family without leaving ambiguities, and establishing likely false-negative and -positive relationships, but that used together a relatively clear view emerges. Generally, we find that most R2R3 MYBs that regulate SCW in Arabidopsis are likely conserved in the grasses. This comparative analysis of the R2R3 MYB family will facilitate transfer of understanding of regulatory mechanisms among species and enable control of SCW biosynthesis in switchgrass toward improving its biomass quality.
24816929	Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that cadmium stress signaling controls the expression of genes in drought stress signal pathways in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Plant growth is severely affected by toxic concentrations of the non-essential heavy metal cadmium (Cd). Comprehensive transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq following cadmium exposure is required to further understand plant responses to Cd and facilitate future systems-based analyses of the underlying regulatory networks. In this study, rice plants were hydroponically treated with 50 µM Cd for 24 hours and ∼60,000 expressed transcripts, including transcripts that could not be characterized by microarray-based approaches, were evaluated. Upregulation of various ROS-scavenging enzymes, chelators and metal transporters demonstrated the appropriate expression profiles to Cd exposure. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the responsive transcripts indicated the upregulation of many drought stress-related genes under Cd exposure. Further investigation into the expression of drought stress marker genes such as DREB suggested that expression of genes in several drought stress signal pathways was activated under Cd exposure. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses of randomly selected Cd-responsive metal transporter transcripts under various metal ion stresses suggested that the expression of Cd-responsive transcripts might be easily affected by other ions. Our transcriptome analysis demonstrated a new transcriptional network linking Cd and drought stresses in rice. Considering our data and that Cd is a non-essential metal, the network underlying Cd stress responses and tolerance, which plants have developed to adapt to other stresses, could help to acclimate to Cd exposure. Our examination of this transcriptional network provides useful information for further studies of the molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation to Cd exposure and the improvement of tolerance in crop species.
24854982	The CRISPR/Cas9 system produces specific and homozygous targeted gene editing in rice in one generation.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been demonstrated to efficiently induce targeted gene editing in a variety of organisms including plants. Recent work showed that CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene mutations in Arabidopsis were mostly somatic mutations in the early generation, although some mutations could be stably inherited in later generations. However, it remains unclear whether this system will work similarly in crops such as rice. In this study, we tested in two rice subspecies 11 target genes for their amenability to CRISPR/Cas9-induced editing and determined the patterns, specificity and heritability of the gene modifications. Analysis of the genotypes and frequency of edited genes in the first generation of transformed plants (T0) showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was highly efficient in rice, with target genes edited in nearly half of the transformed embryogenic cells before their first cell division. Homozygotes of edited target genes were readily found in T0 plants. The gene mutations were passed to the next generation (T1) following classic Mendelian law, without any detectable new mutation or reversion. Even with extensive searches including whole genome resequencing, we could not find any evidence of large-scale off-targeting in rice for any of the many targets tested in this study. By specifically sequencing the putative off-target sites of a large number of T0 plants, low-frequency mutations were found in only one off-target site where the sequence had 1-bp difference from the intended target. Overall, the data in this study point to the CRISPR/Cas9 system being a powerful tool in crop genome engineering.
24895563	Grain sterility in relation to dry mass production and distribution in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Biomed Res Int	The experiment was conducted to investigate potential causes of grain sterility in widely cultivated rice variety in Malaysia, MR219 and its two mutant lines (RM311 and RM109) by examining the source-sink relations. RM311 produced increased dry matter yield both at heading and maturity and also showed higher grain yield with greater proportion of grain sterility than the other two genotypes (RM109 and MR219) resulting in the lowest harvest index (49.68%). In contrast, harvest index was greater in RM109 (53.34%) and MR219 (52.76%) with less grain sterility percentage than MR311 indicating that dry matter partitioning to economic yield was better in RM109 and MR219 than in MR311. Results indicated that dry matter allocation per spikelet from heading to maturity was important for reducing grain sterility in rice. The greater above-ground crop dry matter per spikelet was observed in RM109 and MR219 as compared to high dry matter producing genotype; RM311 implies that poor grain filling may not have resulted from dry matter production or source limitation. These findings suggest that grain sterility or poor grain filling in rice is the result of poor translocation and partitioning of assimilates into grains (sink) rather than of limited biomass production or source limitation.
24822269	Priming of protein expression in the defence response of Zantedeschia aethiopica to Pectobacterium carotovorum.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	The defence response of Zantedeschia aethiopica, a natural rhizomatous host of the soft rot bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum, was studied following the activation of common induced resistance pathways—systemic acquired resistance and induced systemic resistance. Proteomic tools were used, together with in vitro quantification and in situ localization of selected oxidizing enzymes. In total, 527 proteins were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry (MS) and annotated against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant (nr) protein database of rice (Oryza sativa). Of these, the fore most differentially expressed group comprised 215 proteins that were primed following application of methyl jasmonate (MJ) and subsequent infection with the pathogen. Sixty-five proteins were down-regulated following MJ treatments. The application of benzothiadiazole (BTH) increased the expression of 23 proteins; however, subsequent infection with the pathogen repressed their expression and did not induce priming. The sorting of primed proteins by Gene Ontology protein function category revealed that the primed proteins included nucleic acid-binding proteins, cofactor-binding proteins, ion-binding proteins, transferases, hydrolases and oxidoreductases. In line with the highlighted involvement of oxidoreductases in the defence response, we determined their activities, priming pattern and localization in planta. Increased activities were confined to the area surrounding the pathogen penetration site, associating these enzymes with the induced systemic resistance afforded by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. The results presented here demonstrate the concerted priming of protein expression following MJ treatment, making it a prominent part of the defence response of Z. aethiopica to P. carotovorum.
24810734	Casuarine stereoisomers from achiral substrates: chemoenzymatic synthesis and inhibitory properties.	2014	J Org Chem	A straightforward chemoenzymatic synthesis of four uncovered casuarine stereoisomers is described. The strategy consists of L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase F131A-variant-catalyzed aldol addition of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to aldehyde derivatives of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and its enantiomer (LAB) and subsequent one-pot catalytic deprotection-reductive amination. DAB and LAB were obtained from dihydroxyacetone and aminoethanol using D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase and L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase catalysts, respectively. The new ent-3-epi-casuarine is a strong inhibitor of α-d-glucosidase from rice and of rat intestinal sucrase.
25036129	Biochemical analyses of ppGpp effect on adenylosuccinate synthetases, key enzymes in purine biosynthesis in rice.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The ppGpp-signaling system functions in plant chloroplasts. In bacteria, a negative effect of ppGpp on adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) has been suggested. Our biochemical analysis also revealed rice AdSS homologs are apparently sensitive to ppGpp. However, further investigation clarified that this phenomenon is cancelled by the high substrate affinity to the enzymes, leading to a limited effect of ppGpp on adenylosuccinate synthesis.
24884531	Natural rice rhizospheric microbes suppress rice blast infections.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The natural interactions between plant roots and their rhizospheric microbiome are vital to plant fitness, modulating both growth promotion and disease suppression. In rice (Oryza sativa), a globally important food crop, as much as 30% of yields are lost due to blast disease caused by fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Capitalizing on the abilities of naturally occurring rice soil bacteria to reduce M. oryzae infections could provide a sustainable solution to reduce the amount of crops lost to blast disease.

RESULTS: Naturally occurring root-associated rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from California field grown rice plants (M-104), eleven of which were taxonomically identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Bacterial isolates were tested for biocontrol activity against the devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen, M. oryzae pathovar 70-15. In vitro, a Pseudomonas isolate, EA105, displayed antibiosis through reducing appressoria formation by nearly 90% as well as directly inhibiting fungal growth by 76%. Although hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a volatile commonly produced by biocontrol pseudomonads, the activity of EA105 seems to be independent of its HCN production. During in planta experiments, EA105 reduced the number of blast lesions formed by 33% and Pantoea agglomerans isolate, EA106 by 46%. Our data also show both EA105 and EA106 trigger jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) response in rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Out of 11 bacteria isolated from rice soil, pseudomonad EA105 most effectively inhibited the growth and appressoria formation of M. oryzae through a mechanism that is independent of cyanide production. In addition to direct antagonism, EA105 also appears to trigger ISR in rice plants through a mechanism that is dependent on JA and ET signaling, ultimately resulting in fewer blast lesions. The application of native bacteria as biocontrol agents in combination with current disease protection strategies could aid in global food security.
24843076	Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Flavones are a major class of flavonoids with a wide range of physiological functions in plants. They are constitutively accumulated as C-glycosides and O-linked conjugates in vegetative tissues of grasses. It has long been presumed that the two structural modifications of flavones occur through independent metabolic routes. Previously, we reported that cytochrome P450 93G2 (CYP93G2) functions as a flavanone 2-hydroxylase (F2H) that provides 2-hydroxyflavanones for C-glycosylation in rice (Oryza sativa). Flavone C-glycosides are subsequently formed by dehydratase activity on 2-hydroxyflavanone C-glycosides. On the other hand, O-linked modifications were proposed to proceed after the flavone nucleus is generated. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones. In recombinant enzyme assays, CYP93G1 desaturated naringenin and eriodictyol to apigenin and luteolin, respectively. Consistently, transgenic expression of CYP93G1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in the accumulation of different flavone O-glycosides, which are not naturally present in cruciferous plants. Metabolite analysis of a rice CYP93G1 insertion mutant further demonstrated the preferential depletion of tricin O-linked flavanolignans and glycosides. By contrast, redirection of metabolic flow to the biosynthesis of flavone C-glycosides was observed. Our findings established that CYP93G1 is a key branch point enzyme channeling flavanones to the biosynthesis of tricin O-linked conjugates in rice. Functional diversification of F2H and FNSII in the cytochrome P450 CYP93G subfamily may represent a lineage-specific event leading to the prevalent cooccurrence of flavone C- and O-linked derivatives in grasses today.
24885990	Identification and mapping of stable QTL with main and epistasis effect on rice grain yield under upland drought stress.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses that cause drastic reduction in rice grain yield (GY) in rainfed environments. The identification and introgression of QTL leading to high GY under drought have been advocated to be the preferred breeding strategy to improve drought tolerance of popular rice varieties. Genetic control of GY under reproductive-stage drought stress (RS) was studied in two BC1F4 mapping populations derived from crosses of Kali Aus, a drought-tolerant aus cultivar, with high-yielding popular varieties MTU1010 and IR64. The aim was to identify QTL for GY under RS that show a large and consistent effect for the trait. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) was used to identify significant markers putatively linked with high GY under drought.

RESULTS: QTL analysis revealed major-effect GY QTL: qDTY1.2, qDTY2.2 and qDTY1.3, qDTY2.3 (DTY; Drought grain yield) under drought consistently over two seasons in Kali Aus/2*MTU1010 and Kali Aus/2*IR64 populations, respectively. qDTY1.2 and qDTY2.2 explained an additive effect of 288 kg ha-1 and 567 kg ha-1 in Kali Aus/2*MTU1010, whereas qDTY1.3 and qDTY2.3 explained an additive effect of 198 kg ha-1 and 147 kg ha-1 in Kali Aus/2*IR64 populations, respectively.Epistatic interaction was observed for DTF (days to flowering) between regions on chromosome 2 flanked by markers RM154-RM324 and RM263-RM573 and major epistatic QTL for GY showing interaction between genomic locations on chromosome 1 at marker interval RM488-RM315 and chromosome 2 at RM324-RM263 in 2012 DS and 2013 DS RS in Kali Aus/2*IR64 mapping populations.

CONCLUSION: The QTL, qDTY1.2, qDTY1.3, qDTY2.2, and qDTY2.3, identified in this study can be used to improve GY of mega varieties MTU1010 and IR64 under different degrees of severity of drought stress through marker-aided backcrossing and provide farmers with improved varieties that effectively combine high yield potential with good yield under drought. The observed epistatic interaction for GY and DTF will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of agronomically important traits and enhance predictive ability at an individualized level in agriculture.
24976122	Expression patterns of ABA and GA metabolism genes and hormone levels during rice seed development and imbibition: a comparison of dormant and non-dormant rice cultivars.	2014	J Genet Genomics	Seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait in cereals. Using deep dormant (N22), medium dormant (ZH11), and non-dormant (G46B) rice cultivars, we correlated seed dormancy phenotypes with abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism gene expression profiles and phytohormone levels during seed development and imbibition. A time course analysis of ABA and GA content during seed development showed that N22 had a high ABA level at early and middle seed developmental stages, while at late developmental stage it declined to the level of ZH11; however, its ABA/GA ratio maintained at a high level throughout seed development. By contrast, G46B had the lowest ABA content during seed development though at early developmental stage its ABA level was close to that of ZH11, and its ABA/GA ratio peaked at late developmental stage that was at the same level of ZH11. Compared with N22 and G46B, ZH11 had an even and medium ABA level during seed development and its ABA/GA ratio peaked at the middle developmental stage. Moreover, the seed development time-point having high ABA/GA ratio also had relatively high transcript levels for key genes in ABA and GA metabolism pathways across three cultivars. These indicated that the embryo-imposed dormancy has been induced before the late developmental stage and is determined by ABA/GA ratio. A similar analysis during seed imbibition showed that ABA was synthesized in different degrees for the three cultivars. In addition, water uptake assay for intact mature seeds suggested that water could permeate through husk barrier into seed embryo for all three cultivars; however, all three cultivars showed distinct colors by vanillin-staining indicative of the existence of flavans in their husks, which are dormancy inhibition compounds responsible for the husk-imposed dormancy.
24874118	A novel Azotobacter vinellandii (SRIAz 3) functions in salinity stress tolerance in rice.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	The plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) as a biofertilizer provide agricultural benefits to advance various crops productivity. Recently, we discovered a novel Azotobacter vinellandii (SRIAz 3) from rice rhizosphere, which is well competent to improve rice productivity. In this study, we investigated a role of A. vinellandii to confer salinity tolerance in rice (var. IR64). A. vinellandii inoculated rice plants showed higher proline and malondialdehyde content under 200 mM NaCl stress as compared with uninoculated one. The endogenous level of plant hormones viz., indole-3 acetic acid (IAA), gibberellins (GA 3), zeatint (Zt) was higher in A. vinellandii inoculated plants under high salinity. The fresh biomass of root and shoot were relatively elevated in A. vinellandii inoculated rice. Further, the macronutrient profile was superior in A. vinellandii inoculated plants under salinity as compared with non-inoculated plants. The present findings further suggest that A. vinellandii, a potent biofertilzer, potentially confer salinity stress tolerance in rice via sustaining growth and improving compatible solutes and nutrients profile and thereby crop improvement.
25017169	RNA silencing is induced by the expression of foreign recombinant products in transgenic rice.	2014	Plant Sci	RNA silencing plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. We previously reported that RNA silencing of a linked endogenous gene and a transgene in transgenic rice seeds can be induced by the expression of foreign recombinant mGLP-1, which acts as a silencing-inducible sequence through RNA interference. In this study, we found that the induction of RNA silencing by foreign transgenes is not restricted to mGLP-1 but is observed in many other genes as a relatively general phenomenon, as several foreign genes were involved in inducing RNA silencing in the same manner as mGLP-1 in transgenic rice. We detected 21-24-nt siRNAs using both sense and antisense probes specific to the silenced genes in both the leaves and endosperm of transgenic rice plants. Moreover, read-through transcripts were consistently observed in silenced transgenic rice plants. Taken together, these results suggest that proper transcription termination was prevented in these plants, and the highly divergent 3'-end transcripts served as templates for double-stranded RNA synthesis, resulting in the degradation of the target genes via siRNA.
25130735	A genome-wide survey of homeodomain-leucine zipper genes and analysis of cold-responsive HD-Zip I members' expression in tomato.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) proteins are a kind of transcriptional factors that play a vital role in plant growth and development. However, no detailed information of HD-Zip family in tomato has been reported till now. In this study, 51 HD-Zip genes (SlHZ01-51) in this family were identified and categorized into 4 classes by exon-intron and protein structure in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome. The synthetical phylogenetic tree of tomato, Arabidopsis and rice HD-Zip genes were established for an insight into their evolutionary relationships and putative functions. The results showed that the contribution of segmental duplication was larger than that of tandem duplication for expansion and evolution of genes in this family of tomato. The expression profile results under abiotic stress suggested that all SlHZ I genes were responsive to cold stress. This study will provide a clue for the further investigation of functional identification and the role of tomato HD-Zip I subfamily in plant cold stress responses and developmental events.
25209506	Determination of hydrophobicity of dry-heated wheat starch granules using sucrose fatty acid esters (SFAE).	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Sucrose fatty acid esters (SFAE) were adsorbed onto dry-heated (120 °C for 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 min) wheat starch granules and extracted with ethyl ether in a Soxhlet apparatus without gelatinization of the starch granules. The amount of sucrose in the extracted SFAE was determined by the phenol sulfate method. A gradual increase of the sucrose from 159 to 712 μg, in SFAE per gram of starch, occurred with increasing dry-heating time and demonstrated the increased hydrophobicity of the starch granules. Increase of the SFAE was highly correlated (r = 0.9816) to increase of the oil-binding capacity of the dry-heated wheat starch granules. Non-waxy rice, waxy rice, sweet potato, and potato starch granules also showed higher hydrophobicity after dry-heating by this method.
24937154	Genetic stability developed for β-carotene synthesis in BR29 rice line using dihaploid homozygosity.	2014	PLoS One	Obtaining transgenic crop lines with stable levels of carotenoids is highly desirable. We addressed this issue by employing the anther culture technique to develop dihaploid lines containing genes involved in β-carotene metabolism. First, we used Agrobacterium- mediated transformation to develop primary transgenic plants containing the β-carotene biosynthetic genes, phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI), which were engineered for expression and accumulation in the endosperm. Transgenic plants were recovered by selecting for the expression of the phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) gene. Dihaploid plants in addition to haploid and tetraploid plant were generated from anther cultures of these primary transgenic plants. In addition to anatomical features of stomata, pollen of different ploidy-plants, molecular analyses confirmed the stable integration of the genes in the anther culture-derived dihaploid plants, and the yellow color of the polished seeds indicated the accumulation of carotenoids in the endosperm. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the carotenoid extract further confirmed the levels of β-carotene accumulation in the endosperms of the transgenic dihaploid rice seeds.
24928872	Binding site concentration explains the differential susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis and Sesamia inferens to Cry1A-producing rice.	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	Chilo suppressalis and Sesamia inferens are two important lepidopteran rice pests that occur concurrently during outbreaks in paddy fields in the main rice-growing areas of China. Previous and current field tests demonstrate that the transgenic rice line Huahui 1 (HH1) producing a Cry1Ab-Cry1Ac hybrid toxin from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis reduces egg and larval densities of C. suppressalis but not of S. inferens. This differential susceptibility to HH1 rice correlates with the reduced susceptibility to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins in S. inferens larvae compared to C. suppressalis larvae. The goal of this study was to identify the mechanism responsible for this differential susceptibility. In saturation binding assays, both Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxins bound with high affinity and in a saturable manner to midgut brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from C. suppressalis and S. inferens larvae. While binding affinities were similar, a dramatically lower concentration of Cry1A toxin binding sites was detected for S. inferens BBMV than for C. suppressalis BBMV. In contrast, no significant differences between species were detected for Cry1Ca toxin binding to BBMV. Ligand blotting detected BBMV proteins binding Cry1Ac or Cry1Ca toxins, some of them unique to C. suppressalis or S. inferens. These data support that reduced Cry1A binding site concentration is associated with a lower susceptibility to Cry1A toxins and HH1 rice in S. inferens larvae than in C. suppressalis larvae. Moreover, our data support Cry1Ca as a candidate for pyramiding efforts with Cry1A-producing rice to extend the activity range and durability of this technology against rice stem borers.
24987303	Effects of allelic variations in starch synthesis-related genes on grain quality traits of Korean nonglutinous rice varieties under different temperature conditions.	2014	Breed Sci	Influences of allelic variations in starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) on rice grain quality were examined. A total of 187 nonglutinous Korean rice varieties, consisting of 170 Japonica and 17 Tongil-type varieties, were grown in the field and in two greenhouse conditions. The percentages of head rice and chalky grains, amylose content, alkali digestion value, and rapid visco-analysis characteristics were evaluated in the three different environments. Among the 10 previously reported SSRG markers used in this study, seven were polymorphic, and four of those showed subspecies-specific allele distributions. Six out of the seven polymorphic SSRG markers were significantly associated with at least one grain quality trait (R (2) > 0.1) across the three different environments. However, the association level and significance were markedly lower when the analysis was repeated using only the 170 Japonica varieties. Similarly, the significant associations between SSRG allelic variations and changes in grain quality traits under increased temperature were largely attributable to the biased allele frequency between the two subpopulations. Our results suggest that within Korean Japonica varieties, these 10 major SSRG loci have been highly fixed during breeding history and variations in grain quality traits might be influenced by other genetic factors.
24931499	Inducing the oxidative stress response in Escherichia coli improves the quality of a recombinant protein: magnesium chelatase ChlH.	2014	Protein Expr Purif	The ∼150kDa ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase from Oryza sativa, Hordeum vulgare and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been heterologously expressed in Escherichiacoli. The active soluble protein is found as both a multimeric and a monomeric form. The multimeric ChlH appears to be oxidatively damaged but monomer production is favoured in growth conditions that are known to cause an oxidative stress response in E.coli. Inducing an oxidative stress response may be of general utility to improve the quality of proteins expressed in E. coli. The similar responses of ChlH's from the three different species suggest that oligomerization of oxidatively damaged ChlH may have a functional role in the chloroplast, possibly as a signal of oxidative stress or damage.
24941328	Abscisic Acid-Cytokinin Antagonism Modulates Resistance Against Pseudomonas syringae in Tobacco.	2014	Phytopathology	Phytohormones are known as essential regulators of plant defenses, with ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid as the central immunity backbone, while other phytohormones have been demonstrated to interact with this. Only recently, a function of the classic phytohormone cytokinin in plant immunity has been described in Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco. Although interactions of cytokinins with salicylic acid and auxin have been indicated, the complete network of cytokinin interactions with other immunity-relevant phytohormones is not yet understood. Therefore, we studied the interaction of kinetin and abscisic acid as a negative regulator of plant immunity to modulate resistance in tobacco against Pseudomonas syringae. By analyzing infection symptoms, pathogen proliferation, and accumulation of the phytoalexin scopoletin as a key mediator of kinetin-induced resistance in tobacco, antagonistic interaction of these phytohormones in plant immunity was identified. Kinetin reduced abscisic acid levels in tobacco, while increased abscisic acid levels by exogenous application or inhibition of abscisic acid catabolism by diniconazole neutralized kinetin-induced resistance. Based on these results, we conclude that reduction of abscisic acid levels by enhanced abscisic acid catabolism strongly contributes to cytokinin-mediated resistance effects. Thus, the identified cytokinin-abscisic acid antagonism is a novel regulatory mechanism in plant immunity.
25018764	Identification of "safe harbor" loci in indica rice genome by harnessing the property of zinc-finger nucleases to induce DNA damage and repair.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) have proved to be successful tools for targeted genome manipulation in several organisms. Their main property is the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific sites, which are further repaired through homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, for the appropriate integration of genes at specific chromosomal locations, proper sites for gene integration need to be identified. These regions, hereby named safe harbor loci, must be localized in non-coding regions and possess high gene expression. In the present study, three different ZFN constructs (pZFN1, pZFN2, pZFN3), harboring β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter gene, were used to identify safe harbor loci on rice chromosomes. The constructs were delivered into IR64 rice by using an improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol, based on the use of immature embryos. Gene expression was measured by histochemical GUS activity and the flanking regions were determined through thermal-asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL PCR). Following sequencing, 28 regions were identified as putative sites for safe integration, but only one was localized in a non-coding region and also possessed high GUS expression. These findings have significant applicability to create crops with new and valuable traits, since the site can be subsequently used to stably introduce one or more genes in a targeted manner.
25110136	Pre-illumination of rice blast conidia induces tolerance to subsequent oxidative stress.	2014	Fungal Biol	Many environmental factors, alone or combined, affect organisms by changing a pro-/antioxidant balance. Here we tested rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) for possible cross-adaptations caused by relatively intense light and protecting from artificially formed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-dependent fungitoxic response of the host plant. Spore germination was found to be suppressed under 4-h and, to larger extent, 5-h illumination. The effect was diminished by antioxidants and, therefore, suggests involvement of ROS. One-hour of light did not affect spore germination, but stimulated their chemically assayed superoxide production. The illuminated spores were more tolerant (than non-illuminated ones) to artificially generated H(2)O(2), O(2)(-), or OH or to toxic diffusate of rice leaf. They also caused more severe disease symptoms if applied to leaves of the susceptible rice cultivar at low concentration. Spore diffusates decomposed hydrogen peroxide. They detoxified exogenous H(2)O(2) and superoxide radical as well as leaf diffusates. Spore illumination increased some of these protective effects. It is suggested that short-term light led to mild oxidative stress, which induced spore antioxidant capacity, enhancing spore tolerance to subsequent stronger oxidative stress and its aggressiveness in planta. Such tolerance depends partly on the antidotal action of spore extracellular compounds, which may also be light-stimulated. Therefore, a certain ROS-related environmental factor may adapt a fungus to other factors and so modulate its pathogenic properties.
24913626	Microarray analysis of laser-microdissected tissues indicates the biosynthesis of suberin in the outer part of roots during formation of a barrier to radial oxygen loss in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	J Exp Bot	Internal aeration is crucial for root growth in waterlogged soil. A barrier to radial oxygen loss (ROL) can enhance long-distance oxygen transport via the aerenchyma to the root tip; a higher oxygen concentration at the apex enables root growth into anoxic soil. The ROL barrier is formed within the outer part of roots (OPR). Suberin and/or lignin deposited in cell walls are thought to contribute to the barrier, but it is unclear which compound is the main constituent. This study describes gene expression profiles during ROL barrier formation in rice roots to determine the relative responses of suberin and/or lignin biosyntheses for the barrier. OPR tissues were isolated by laser microdissection and their transcripts were analysed by microarray. A total of 128 genes were significantly up- or downregulated in the OPR during the barrier formation. Genes associated with suberin biosynthesis were strongly upregulated, whereas genes associated with lignin biosynthesis were not. By an ab initio analysis of the promoters of the upregulated genes, the putative cis-elements that could be associated with transcription factors, WRKY, AP2/ERF, NAC, bZIP, MYB, CBT/DREB, and MADS, were elucidated. They were particularly associated with the expression of transcription factor genes containing WRKY, AP2, and MYB domains. A semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis of genes associated with suberin biosynthesis (WRKY, CYP, and GPAT) confirmed that they were highly expressed during ROL barrier formation. Overall, these results suggest that suberin is a major constituent of the ROL barrier in roots of rice.
25071406	Characterization and mapping of a spotted leaf mutant in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Genet Mol Biol	Spotted leaf mutant belongs to a class of mutants that can produce necrotic lesions spontaneously in plants without any attack by pathogens. These mutants have no beneficial effect on plant productivity but provide a unique opportunity to study programmed cell death in plant defense responses. A novel rice spotted leaf mutant (spl30) was isolated through low-energy heavy ion irradiation. Lesion expression was sensitive to light and humidity. The spl30 mutant caused a decrease in chlorophyll and soluble protein content, with marked accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) around the lesions. In addition, the spl30 mutant significantly enhanced resistance to rice bacterial blight (X. oryzae pv. oryzae) from China (C1-C7). The use of SSR markers showed that the spl30 gene was located between markers XSN2 and XSN4. The genetic distance between the spl30 gene and XSN2 and between spl30 and XSN4 was 1.7 cM and 0.2 cM, respectively. The spl30 gene is a new gene involved in lesion production and may be related to programmed cell death in rice. The ability of this mutant to confer broad resistance to bacterial blight provides a model for studying the interaction between plants and pathogenic bacteria.
24928870	Metaproteomic identification of diazotrophic methanotrophs and their localization in root tissues of field-grown rice plants.	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	In a previous study by our group, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the roots of wild-type rice plants in a paddy field with no N input; both processes are likely controlled by a rice gene for microbial symbiosis. The present study examined which microorganisms in rice roots were responsible for CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation under the field conditions. Metaproteomic analysis of root-associated bacteria from field-grown rice (Oryza sativa Nipponbare) revealed that nitrogenase complex-containing nitrogenase reductase (NifH) and the alpha subunit (NifD) and beta subunit (NifK) of dinitrogenase were mainly derived from type II methanotrophic bacteria of the family Methylocystaceae, including Methylosinus spp. Minor nitrogenase proteins such as Methylocella, Bradyrhizobium, Rhodopseudomonas, and Anaeromyxobacter were also detected. Methane monooxygenase proteins (PmoCBA and MmoXYZCBG) were detected in the same bacterial group of the Methylocystaceae. Because these results indicated that Methylocystaceae members mediate both CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation, we examined their localization in rice tissues by using catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). The methanotrophs were localized around the epidermal cells and vascular cylinder in the root tissues of the field-grown rice plants. Our metaproteomics and CARD-FISH results suggest that CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation are performed mainly by type II methanotrophs of the Methylocystaceae, including Methylosinus spp., inhabiting the vascular bundles and epidermal cells of rice roots.
25036124	Crystal structure of α-amylase from Oryza sativa: molecular insights into enzyme activity and thermostability.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	AmyI-1 is an α-amylase from Oryza sativa (rice) and plays a crucial role in degrading starch in various tissues and at various growth stages. This enzyme is a glycoprotein with an N-glycosylated carbohydrate chain, a unique characteristic among plant α-amylases. In this study, we report the first crystal structure of AmyI-1 at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure consists of a typical (β/α)8-barrel, which is well-conserved among most α-amylases in the glycoside hydrolase family-13. Structural superimposition indicated small variations in the catalytic domain and carbohydrate-binding sites between AmyI-1 and barley α-amylases. By contrast, regions around the N-linked glycosylation sites displayed lower conservation of amino acid residues, including Asn-263, Asn-265, Thr-307, Asn-342, Pro-373, and Ala-374 in AmyI-1, which are not conserved in barley α-amylases, suggesting that these residues may contribute to the construction of the structure of glycosylated AmyI-1. These results increase the depths of our understanding of the biological functions of AmyI-1.
24987489	Gene response in rice plants treated with continuous fog influenced by pH, was similar to that treated with biotic stress.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Throughout Asia, including Japan, rice plants are cultivated in a wide range of areas from lowlands to highlands and are frequently exposed to fog, including acid fog. Some physiological studies have shown that acid fog can be a stress factor for plants. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of rice plants treated with artificially prepared simulated acid fog (SiAF) or simulated neutral fog (SiNF) for 1 or 7 days.

RESULTS: Microarray analysis results suggested that both the SiAF and the SiNF treatments induced the expression of genes involved in the defense and stress responses in rice plants. Induction of such genes was detected in plants treated with SiAF for 1 day, and the number of induced genes increased in plants treated with SiAF for 7 days. The genes for defense and stress responses were also induced by SiNF for 7 days, although they were not induced by SiNF for 1 day. The gene expression profiles of the SiAF-treated and the SiNF-treated plants were compared to those of plants treated with other stress factors. The comparison revealed that both SiAF and SiNF treatments have similar effects to biotic stresses and ozone stress. The genes encoding NADPH oxidase and germin, which function in apoplasts, were also induced by SiAF, SiNF and biotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the SiAF and the SiNF treatments may result in oxidative stress through the apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species.
24960559	The whole chloroplast genome of wild rice (Oryza australiensis).	2016	Mitochondrial DNA A DNA Mapp Seq Anal	The whole chloroplast genome of wild rice (Oryza australiensis) is characterized in this study. The genome size is 135,224  bp, exhibiting a typical circular structure including a pair of 25,776  bp inverted repeats (IRa,b) separated by a large single-copy region (LSC) of 82,212  bp and a small single-copy region (SSC) of 12,470  bp. The overall GC content of the genome is 38.95%. 110 unique genes were annotated, including 76 protein-coding genes, 4 ribosomal RNA genes, and 30t RNA genes. Among these, 18 are duplicated in the inverted repeat regions, 13 genes contain one intron, and 2 genes (rps12 and ycf3) have two introns.
24949743	Yield-enhancing heterotic QTL transferred from wild species to cultivated rice Oryza sativa L.	2014	PLoS One	Utilization of "hidden genes" from wild species has emerged as a novel option for enrichment of genetic diversity for productivity traits. In rice we have generated more than 2000 lines having introgression from 'A' genome-donor wild species of rice in the genetic background of popular varieties PR114 and Pusa44 were developed. Out of these, based on agronomic acceptability, 318 lines were used for developing rice hybrids to assess the effect of introgressions in heterozygous state. These introgression lines and their recurrent parents, possessing fertility restoration ability for wild abortive (WA) cytoplasm, were crossed with cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line PMS17A to develop hybrids. Hybrids developed from recurrent parents were used as checks to compare the performance of 318 hybrids developed by hybridizing alien introgression lines with PMS17A. Seventeen hybrids expressed a significant increase in yield and its component traits over check hybrids. These 17 hybrids were re-evaluated in large-size replicated plots. Of these, four hybrids, viz., ILH299, ILH326, ILH867 and ILH901, having introgressions from O. rufipogon and two hybrids (ILH921 and ILH951) having introgressions from O. nivara showed significant heterosis over parental introgression line, recurrent parents and check hybrids for grain yield-related traits. Alien introgressions were detected in the lines taken as male parents for developing six superior hybrids, using a set of 100 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Percent introgression showed a range of 2.24 from in O. nivara to 7.66 from O. rufipogon. The introgressed regions and their putative association with yield components in hybrids is reported and discussed.
24968225	Genome-wide analysis of the NADK gene family in plants.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: NAD(H) kinase (NADK) is the key enzyme that catalyzes de novo synthesis of NADP(H) from NAD(H) for NADP(H)-based metabolic pathways. In plants, NADKs form functional subfamilies. Studies of these families in Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that they have undergone considerable evolutionary selection; however, the detailed evolutionary history and functions of the various NADKs in plants are not clearly understood.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a comparative genomic analysis that identified 74 NADK gene homologs from 24 species representing the eight major plant lineages within the supergroup Plantae: glaucophytes, rhodophytes, chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, monocots and eudicots. Phylogenetic and structural analysis classified these NADK genes into four well-conserved subfamilies with considerable variety in the domain organization and gene structure among subfamily members. In addition to the typical NAD_kinase domain, additional domains, such as adenylate kinase, dual-specificity phosphatase, and protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domains, were found in subfamily II. Interestingly, NADKs in subfamily III exhibited low sequence similarity (∼30%) in the kinase domain within the subfamily and with the other subfamilies. These observations suggest that gene fusion and exon shuffling may have occurred after gene duplication, leading to specific domain organization seen in subfamilies II and III, respectively. Further analysis of the exon/intron structures showed that single intron loss and gain had occurred, yielding the diversified gene structures, during the process of structural evolution of NADK family genes. Finally, both available global microarray data analysis and qRT-RCR experiments revealed that the NADK genes in Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa show different expression patterns in different developmental stages and under several different abiotic/biotic stresses and hormone treatments, underscoring the functional diversity and functional divergence of the NADK family in plants.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings will facilitate further studies of the NADK family and provide valuable information for functional validation of this family in plants.
24926322	Tc1-like transposable elements in plant genomes.	2014	Mob DNA	BACKGROUND: The Tc1/mariner superfamily of transposable elements (TEs) is widespread in animal genomes. Mariner-like elements, which bear a DDD triad catalytic motif, have been identified in a wide range of flowering plant species. However, as the founding member of the superfamily, Tc1-like elements that bear a DD34E triad catalytic motif are only known to unikonts (animals, fungi, and Entamoeba).

RESULTS: Here we report the identification of Tc1-like elements (TLEs) in plant genomes. These elements bear the four terminal nucleotides and the characteristic DD34E triad motif of Tc1 element. The two TLE families (PpTc1, PpTc2) identified in the moss (Physcomitrella patens) genome contain highly similar copies. Multiple copies of PpTc1 are actively transcribed and the transcripts encode intact full length transposase coding sequences. TLEs are also found in angiosperm genome sequence databases of rice (Oryza sativa), dwarf birch (Betula nana), cabbage (Brassica rapa), hemp (Cannabis sativa), barley (Hordium valgare), lettuce (Lactuta sativa), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), pear (Pyrus x bretschneideri), and wheat (Triticum urartu).

CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the occurrence of TLEs to the plant phylum. The elements in the moss genome have amplified recently and may still be capable of transposition. The TLEs are also present in angiosperm genomes, but apparently much less abundant than in moss.
24905454	Additional nitrogen fertilization at heading time of rice down-regulates cellulose synthesis in seed endosperm.	2014	PLoS One	The balance between carbon and nitrogen is a key determinant of seed storage components, and thus, is of great importance to rice and other seed-based food crops. To clarify the influence of the rhizosphere carbon/nitrogen balance during the maturation stage of several seed components, transcriptome analysis was performed on the seeds from rice plants that were provided additional nitrogen fertilization at heading time. As a result, it was assessed that genes associated with molecular processes such as photosynthesis, trehalose metabolism, carbon fixation, amino acid metabolism, and cell wall metabolism were differentially expressed. Moreover, cellulose and sucrose synthases, which are involved in cellulose synthesis, were down-regulated. Therefore, we compared cellulose content of mature seeds that were treated with additional nitrogen fertilization with those from control plants using calcofluor staining. In these experiments, cellulose content in endosperm from plants receiving additional nitrogen fertilization was less than that in control endosperm. Other starch synthesis-related genes such as starch synthase 1, starch phosphorylase 2, and branching enzyme 3 were also down-regulated, whereas some α-amylase and β-amylase genes were up-regulated. On the other hand, mRNA expression of amino acid biosynthesis-related molecules was up-regulated. Moreover, additional nitrogen fertilization caused accumulation of storage proteins and up-regulated Cys-poor prolamin mRNA expression. These data suggest that additional nitrogen fertilization at heading time changes the expression of some storage substance-related genes and reduces cellulose levels in endosperm.
24987299	Genetic dissection of black grain rice by the development of a near isogenic line.	2014	Breed Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) can produce black grains as well as white. In black rice, the pericarp of the grain accumulates anthocyanin, which has antioxidant activity and is beneficial to human health. We developed a black rice introgression line in the genetic background of Oryza sativa L. 'Koshihikari', which is a leading variety in Japan. We used Oryza sativa L. 'Hong Xie Nuo' as the donor parent and backcrossed with 'Koshihikari' four times, resulting in a near isogenic line (NIL) for black grains. A whole genome survey of the introgression line using DNA markers suggested that three regions, on chromosomes 1, 3 and 4 are associated with black pigmentation. The locus on chromosome 3 has not been identified previously. A mapping analysis with 546 F2 plants derived from a cross between the black rice NIL and 'Koshihikari' was evaluated. The results indicated that all three loci are essential for black pigmentation. We named these loci Kala1, Kala3 and Kala4. The black rice NIL was evaluated for eating quality and general agronomic traits. The eating quality was greatly superior to that of 'Okunomurasaki', an existing black rice variety. The isogenicity of the black rice NIL to 'Koshihikari' was very high.
24915771	C2H2 type of zinc finger transcription factors in foxtail millet define response to abiotic stresses.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	C2H2 type of zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in plant stress response and hormone signal transduction. Hence considering its importance, genome-wide investigation and characterization of C2H2 zinc finger proteins were performed in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar but no such study was conducted in foxtail millet which is a C4 Panicoid model crop well known for its abiotic stress tolerance. The present study identified 124 C2H2-type zinc finger TFs in foxtail millet (SiC2H2) and physically mapped them onto the genome. The gene duplication analysis revealed that SiC2H2s primarily expanded in the genome through tandem duplication. The phylogenetic tree classified these TFs into five groups (I-V). Further, miRNAs targeting SiC2H2 transcripts in foxtail millet were identified. Heat map demonstrated differential and tissue-specific expression patterns of these SiC2H2 genes. Comparative physical mapping between foxtail millet SiC2H2 genes and its orthologs of sorghum, maize and rice revealed the evolutionary relationships of C2H2 type of zinc finger TFs. The duplication and divergence data provided novel insight into the evolutionary aspects of these TFs in foxtail millet and related grass species. Expression profiling of candidate SiC2H2 genes in response to salinity, dehydration and cold stress showed differential expression pattern of these genes at different time points of stresses.
24948834	Dynamics of Male and Female Chromatin during Karyogamy in Rice Zygotes.	2014	Plant Physiol	In angiosperms, the conversion of an egg cell into a zygote involves two sequential gametic processes: plasmogamy, the fusion of the plasma membranes of male and female gametes, and karyogamy, the fusion of the gametic nuclei. In this study, the nuclei and nuclear membranes of rice (Oryza sativa) gametes were fluorescently labeled using histones 2B-green fluorescent protein/red fluorescent protein and Sad1/UNC-84-domain protein2-green fluorescent protein, respectively, which were heterologously expressed. These gametes were fused in vitro to produce zygotes, and the nuclei and nuclear membranes in the zygotes were observed during karyogamy. The results indicated that the sperm nucleus migrates adjacent to the egg nucleus 5 to 10 min after plasmogamy via an actin cytoskelton, and the egg chromatin then appears to move unidirectionally into the sperm nucleus through a possible nuclear connection. The enlargement of the sperm nucleus accompanies this possible chromatin remodeling. Then, 30 to 70 min after fusion, the sperm chromatin begins to decondense with the completion of karyogamy. Based on these observations, the development of early rice zygotes from plasmogamy to karyogamy was divided into eight stages, and using reverse transcription PCR analyses, paternal and de novo synthesized transcripts were separately detected in zygotes at early and late karyogamy stages, respectively.
24894389	Metabolic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying the anoxic adaptation of rice coleoptile.	2014	AoB Plants	The ability of rice to germinate under anoxia by extending the coleoptile is a highly unusual characteristic and a key feature underpinning the ability of rice seeds to establish in such a stressful environment. The process has been a focal point for research for many years. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anoxic growth of the coleoptile still remain largely unknown. To unravel the key regulatory mechanisms of rice germination under anoxic stress, we combined in silico modelling with gene expression data analysis. Our initial modelling analysis via random flux sampling revealed numerous changes in rice primary metabolism in the absence of oxygen. In particular, several reactions associated with sucrose metabolism and fermentation showed a significant increase in flux levels, whereas reaction fluxes across oxidative phosphorylation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway were down-regulated. The subsequent comparative analysis of the differences in calculated fluxes with previously published gene expression data under air and anoxia identified at least 37 reactions from rice central metabolism that are transcriptionally regulated. Additionally, cis-regulatory content analyses of these transcriptionally controlled enzymes indicate a regulatory role for transcription factors such as MYB, bZIP, ERF and ZnF in transcriptional control of genes that are up-regulated during rice germination and coleoptile elongation under anoxia.
25070039	Identification and functional analysis of AG1-IA specific genes of Rhizoctonia solani.	2014	Curr Genet	Rhizoctonia solani is an important necrotrophic fungal pathogen which causes disease on diverse plant species. It has been classified into 14 genetically distinct anastomosis groups (AGs), however, very little is known about their genomic diversity. AG1-IA causes sheath blight disease in rice and controlling this disease remains a challenge for sustainable rice cultivation. Recently the draft genome sequences of AG1-IA (rice isolate) and AG1-IB (lettuce isolate) had become publicly available. In this study, using comparative genomics, we report identification of 3,942 R. solani genes that are uniquely present in AG1-IA. Many of these genes encode important biological, molecular functions and exhibit dynamic expression during in-planta growth of the pathogen in rice. Based upon sequence similarity with genes that are required for plant and human/zoonotic diseases, we identified several putative virulence/pathogenicity determinants amongst AG1-IA specific genes. While studying the expression of 19 randomly selected genes, we identified three genes highly up-regulated during in-planta growth. The detailed in silico characterization of these genes and extent of their up-regulation in different rice genotypes, having variable degree of disease susceptibility, suggests their importance in rice-Rhizoctonia interactions. In summary, the present study reports identification, functional characterization of AG1-IA specific genes and predicts important virulence determinants that might enable the pathogen to grow inside hostile plant environment. Further characterization of these genes would shed useful insights about the pathogenicity mechanism of AG1-IA on rice.
25056480	A novel elicitor identified from Magnaporthe oryzae triggers defense responses in tobacco and rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Our studies indicate a potential important elicitor candidate which can aid in the fight against a worldwide disease, rice blast. In this study, we report the purification, identification, characterization, and gene cloning of a novel hypersensitive response-inducing protein elicitor (MoHrip2) secreted from an important pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. The protein fraction was isolated from the culture filtrate of M. oryzae and identified by de novo sequencing. The elicitor-encoding gene mohrip2 was cloned following sequence comparison and PCR amplification. This 459-bp gene encodes a 152-residue polypeptide that contains an 18-residue signal peptide and exhibits a pI of 4.72 and an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa. The hypothetical protein, MoHrip2, was expressed in Escherichia coli, and both the recombinant and the endogenous protein caused necrotic lesions in tobacco leaves. In addition to phenolic compound deposition and alkalization of the extracellular medium, MoHrip2 also induced hydrogen peroxide production and nitric oxide accumulation in tobacco cells. Moreover, rice seedlings treated with MoHrip2 exhibited pronounced resistance to M. oryzae compared with control seedlings.
25273131	Prophylactic effect of the oral administration of transgenic rice seeds containing altered peptide ligands of type II collagen on rheumatoid arthritis.	2014	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease associated with the recognition of self proteins secluded in arthritic joints. We generated transgenic rice seeds expressing three types of altered peptide ligands (APL) and the T cell epitope of type II collagen (CII256-271). When these transgenic rice and non-transgenic rice seeds were orally administrated to DBA/1 J mice once a day for 14 days, followed by immunization with CII, the clinical score of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was reduced and inflammation and erosion in the joints were prevented in mice fed APL7 transgenic rice only. IL-10 production against the CII antigen significantly increased in the splenocytes and iLN of CIA mice immunized with the CII antigen, whereas IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-2 levels were not altered. These results suggest that IL-10-mediated immune suppression is involved in the prophylactic effects caused by transgenic rice expressing APL7.
25255563	[Determination of five arsenic species in rice by liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry].	2014	Se Pu	A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of arsenic acid [As (V)], arsenious acid [As (III)], arsenobetaine (AsB), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in rice by liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS). The extraction reagent was 0.3 mol/L nitric acid with heat-assistant condition for 1.5 h at 95 degrees C. Then, the five arsenic species were separated by an anion exchange column (Dionex IonPac AS19, 250 mm x 4 mm) and detected by ICP-MS. Four kinds of extracted solutions were compared through the extraction efficiency. The concentration of nitric acid, the temperature and the extraction time were optimized. The recoveries of the five arsenic species spiked in rice at two levels ranged from 89.6% to 99.5% with the relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 5) of 0.6% - 3.6%. The measured values of the arsenic species in standard rice materials were consistent with their standard values. The linear ranges were 0.05 - 200 microg/L for AsB and DMA, 0.10-400 microg/L for As (III) and MMA, 0.15-600 microg/L for As (V). The limits of detection for the five arsenic species were 0.15-0.45 microg/kg. The results showed that the method is much more precise for the risk assessment of the rice. This method is simple, accurate and durable for the determination of arsenic species in rice.
25027708	Expression and characterization of an M cell-specific ligand-fused dengue virus tetravalent epitope using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2015	J Biosci Bioeng	A fusion construct (Tet-EDIII-Co1) consisting of an M cell-specific peptide ligand (Co1) at the C-terminus of a recombinant tetravalent gene encoding the amino acid sequences of dengue envelope domain III (Tet-EDIII) from four serotypes was expressed and tested for binding activity to the mucosal immune inductive site M cells for the development of an oral vaccine. The yeast episomal expression vector, pYEGPD-TER, which was designed to direct gene expression using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter, a functional signal peptide of the amylase 1A protein from rice, and the GAL7 terminator, was used to clone the Tet-EDIII-Co1 gene and resultant plasmids were then used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PCR and back-transformation into Escherichia coli confirmed the presence of the Tet-EDIII-Co1 gene-containing plasmid in transformants. Northern blot analysis of transformed S. cerevisiae identified the presence of the Tet-EDIII-Co1-specific transcript. Western blot analysis indicated that the produced Tet-EDIII-Co1 protein with the expected molecular weight was successfully secreted into the culture medium. Quantitative Western blot analysis and ELISA revealed that the recombinant Tet-EDIII-Co1 protein comprised approximately 0.1-0.2% of cell-free extracts (CFEs). In addition, 0.1-0.2 mg of Tet-EDIII-Co1 protein per liter of culture filtrate was detected on day 1, and this quantity peaked on day 3 after cultivation. In vivo binding assays showed that the Tet-EDIII-Co1 protein was delivered specifically to M cells in Peyer's patches (PPs) while the Tet-EDIII protein lacking the Co1 ligand did not, which demonstrated the efficient targeting of this antigenic protein through the mucosal-specific ligand.
25104955	Unravelling the proteomic profile of rice meiocytes during early meiosis.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Transfer of genetic traits from wild or related species into cultivated rice is nowadays an important aim in rice breeding. Breeders use genetic crosses to introduce desirable genes from exotic germplasms into cultivated rice varieties. However, in many hybrids there is only a low level of pairing (if existing) and recombination at early meiosis between cultivated rice and wild relative chromosomes. With the objective of getting deeper into the knowledge of the proteins involved in early meiosis, when chromosomes associate correctly in pairs and recombine, the proteome of isolated rice meiocytes has been characterized by nLC-MS/MS at every stage of early meiosis (prophase I). Up to 1316 different proteins have been identified in rice isolated meiocytes in early meiosis, being 422 exclusively identified in early prophase I (leptotene, zygotene, or pachytene). The classification of proteins in functional groups showed that 167 were related to chromatin structure and remodeling, nucleic acid binding, cell-cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton. Moreover, the putative roles of 16 proteins which have not been previously associated to meiosis or were not identified in rice before, are also discussed namely: seven proteins involved in chromosome structure and remodeling, five regulatory proteins [such as SKP1 (OSK), a putative CDK2 like effector], a protein with RNA recognition motifs, a neddylation-related protein, and two microtubule-related proteins. Revealing the proteins involved in early meiotic processes could provide a valuable tool kit to manipulate chromosome associations during meiosis in rice breeding programs. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with the PXD001058 identifier.
25058577	Comparative proteomics analysis of superior and inferior spikelets in hybrid rice during grain filling and response of inferior spikelets to drought stress using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification.	2014	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: The biological functions of the differentially abundant proteins between superior and inferior spikelet grains were investigated based on the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification to further clarify the mechanism of rice grain filling at the proteomic level, as well as the response of inferior spikelets to drought dress (-20kPa or -40kPa). Compared with superior spikelets, inferior ones had lower sink strength due to the lower sink activities (lower abundances of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, granule-bound starch synthase, starch branching enzyme and pullulanase) and smaller sink sizes (lower abundances of structural proteins). The slower and later grain filling resulted from the weaker decomposition and conversion of photoassimilate and the slower cell division. Moderate drought stress (-20kPa) promoted the grain filling of inferior spikelets through regulating the proteins associated with photoassimilate supply and conversion. These proteins may be important targets for rice breeding programs that raise the rice yield under drought condition. The findings offer new insights into rice grain-filling and provide theoretical evidences for better quality control and scientific improvement of super rice in practice.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rice cultivars with large panicles do not always guarantee high yield and grain quality probably due to the slow grain filling and many unfilled grains of inferior spikelets. In general, earlier-flowering superior spikelets, which are usually located on apical primary branches, fill faster and produce larger and heavier grains. In contrast, later-flowering inferior spikelets located on proximal secondary branches are either sterile or fill slowly and poorly, and the differences are more significant in large panicle rice or super rice. The increase of rice yield has been limited by the unsatisfactory grain filling of inferior spikelets, and the inferior spikelets are more prone to environmental factors during grain filling. Thus, we herein investigated the biological functions of differently abundant proteins between superior and inferior spikelet grains by using iTRAQ to unravel the mechanism of rice grain filling and the response of inferior spikelets to drought stress at proteomic level. This study offers new insights into rice grain-filling and provides valuable evidences for better quality control and scientific improvement of super rice in practice.
25036388	Characterization of MORE AXILLARY GROWTH genes in Populus.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Strigolactones are a new class of plant hormones that play a key role in regulating shoot branching. Studies of branching mutants in Arabidopsis, pea, rice and petunia have identified several key genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis or signaling pathway. In the model plant Arabidopsis, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH1 (MAX1), MAX2, MAX3 and MAX4 are four founding members of strigolactone pathway genes. However, little is known about the strigolactone pathway genes in the woody perennial plants.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we report the identification of MAX homologues in the woody model plant Populus trichocarpa. We identified the sequence homologues for each MAX protein in P. trichocarpa. Gene expression analysis revealed that Populus MAX paralogous genes are differentially expressed across various tissues and organs. Furthermore, we showed that Populus MAX genes could complement or partially complement the shoot branching phenotypes of the corresponding Arabidopsis max mutants.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides genetic evidence that strigolactone pathway genes are likely conserved in the woody perennial plants and lays a foundation for further characterization of strigolactone pathway and its functions in the woody perennial plants.
25320466	Bacterial biosynthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-caboxylate (ACC) deaminase, a useful trait to elongation and endophytic colonization of the roots of rice under constant flooded conditions.	2014	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	This study was conducted to investigate the role of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase in Pseudomonas fluorescens strain REN1 and its ability to reduce ethylene levels produced during stress, endophytically colonize and promote the elongation of the roots of rice seedlings under gnotobiotic conditions. We isolated 80 bacteria from inside roots of rice plants grown in the farmers' fields in Guilan, Iran. All of the isolates were characterized for plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. In addition, the colonization assay of these isolates on rice seedlings was carried out to screen for competent endophytes. The best bacterial isolate, based on ACC deaminase production, was identified and used for further study. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the endophyte was closely related to Pseudomonas fluorescens. The results of this study showed ACC deaminase containing P. fluorescens REN1 increased in vitro root elongation and endophytically colonized the root of rice seedlings significantly, as compared to control under constant flooded conditions. The trait of low amount of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production (<15 μg mL(-1)) and the high production of ACC deaminase by bacteria may be main factors in colonizing rice seedling roots compared to other PGP traits (siderophore production and phosphate solubilization) in this study. Endophytic IAA and ACC deaminase-producing bacteria may be preferential selections by rice seedlings. Therefore, it may be suggested that the utilization of ACC as a nutrient gives the isolates advantages in more endophytic colonization and increase of root length of rice seedlings.
25187684	Stress induced MAPK genes show distinct pattern of codon usage in Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max and Oryza sativa.	2014	Bioinformation	Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes provide resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Codon usage profiling of the genes reveals the characteristic features of the genes like nucleotide composition, gene expressivity, optimal codons etc. The present study is a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for different MAPK genes in three organisms, viz. Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean) and Oryza sativa (rice). The study has revealed a high AT content in MAPK genes of Arabidopsis and soybean whereas in rice a balanced AT-GC content at the third synonymous position of codon. The genes show a low bias in codon usage profile as reflected in the higher values (50.83 to 56.55) of effective number of codons (Nc). The prediction of gene expression profile in the MAPK genes revealed that these genes might be under the selective pressure of translational optimization as reflected in the low codon adaptation index (CAI) values ranging from 0.147 to 0.208.
25048445	Identification of small secreted peptides (SSPs) in maize and expression analysis of partial SSP genes in reproductive tissues.	2014	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Maize 1,491 small secreted peptides were identified, which were classified according to the character of peptide sequences. Partial SSP gene expressions in reproductive tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. Small secreted peptides (SSPs) are important cell-cell communication messengers in plants. Most information on plant SSPs come from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, while little is known about the SSPs of other grass species such as maize (Zea mays). In this study, we identified 1,491 SSP genes from maize genomic sequences. These putative SSP genes were distributed throughout the ten maize chromosomes. Among them, 611 SSPs were classified into 198 superfamilies according to their conserved domains, and 725 SSPs with four or more cysteines at their C-termini shared similar cysteine arrangements with their counterparts in other plant species. Moreover, the SSPs requiring post-translational modification, as well as defensin-like (DEFL) proteins, were identified. Further, the expression levels of 110 SSP genes were analyzed in reproductive tissues, including male flower, pollen, silk, and ovary. Most of the genes encoding basal-layer antifungal peptide-like, small coat proteins-like, thioredoxin-like proteins, γ-thionins-like, and DEFL proteins showed high expression levels in the ovary and male flower compared with their levels in silk and mature pollen. The rapid alkalinization factor-like genes were highly expressed only in the mature ovary and mature pollen, and pollen Ole e 1-like genes showed low expression in silk. The results of this study provide basic information for further analysis of SSP functions in the reproductive process of maize.
25345046	[Characteristics of phosphorus uptake and use efficiency of rice with high yield and high phosphorus use efficiency].	2014	Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao	A total of twenty seven middle maturing rice varieties as parent materials were divided into four types based on P use efficiency for grain yield in 2011 by field experiment with normal phosphorus (P) application. The rice variety with high yield and high P efficiency was identified by pot experiment with normal and low P applications, and the contribution rates of various P efficiencies to yield were investigated in 2012. There were significant genotype differences in yield and P efficiency of the test materials. GRLu17/AiTTP//Lu17_2 (QR20) was identified as a variety with high yield and high P efficiency, and its yields at the low and normal rates of P application were 1.96 and 1.92 times of that of Yuxiang B, respectively. The contribution rate of P accumulation to yield was greater than that of P grain production efficiency and P harvest index across field and pot experiments. The contribution rates of P accumulation and P grain production efficiency to yield were not significantly different under the normal P condition, whereas obvious differences were observed under the low P condition (66.5% and 26.6%). The minimal contribution to yield was P harvest index (11.8%). Under the normal P condition, the contribution rates of P accumulation to yield and P harvest index were the highest at the jointing-heading stage, which were 93.4% and 85.7%, respectively. In addition, the contribution rate of P accumulation to grain production efficiency was 41.8%. Under the low P condition, the maximal contribution rates of P accumulation to yield and grain production efficiency were observed at the tillering-jointing stage, which were 56.9% and 20.1% respectively. Furthermore, the contribution rate of P accumulation to P harvest index was 16.0%. The yield, P accumulation, and P harvest index of QR20 significantly increased under the normal P condition by 20.6%, 18.1% and 18.2% respectively compared with that in the low P condition. The rank of the contribution rates of P efficiencies to the yield was in order of P uptake efficiency > P utilization efficiency > P transportation efficiency. The greatest contribution rate of P accumulation to the yield was noticed at the jointing-heading stage with the normal P application while it reached the maximal value at the tillering-jointing stage with the low P application. Therefore, these two stages may be the critical periods to coordinate high yield and high P efficiency in rice.
25084557	Mutation of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene ahpC of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation during the rice-pathogen interaction.	2014	Res Microbiol	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is usually generated by normal aerobic respiration of pathogens and by the host defense response during plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, histochemical localization of H2O2 accumulation in rice inoculated with the wild-type strain (PXO99(A)) and the gene deletion mutant (ΔahpC) of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC) of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, was analyzed. The ΔahpC mutant displayed a significant decrease in endogenous H2O2 accumulation which was induced by the compensatory increase in H2O2 scavenging activity. The change in the bacterial endogenous H2O2 level affected the total amount of H2O2 accumulation during the interaction with rice plants. These results suggested that Xoo contributes to H2O2 accumulation in rice in a compatible interaction, and pathogen-driving H2O2 is in association with cell collapse of rice.
25015319	De novo sequencing and comparative analysis of holy and sweet basil transcriptomes.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Ocimum L. of family Lamiaceae is a well known genus for its ethnobotanical, medicinal and aromatic properties, which are attributed to innumerable phenylpropanoid and terpenoid compounds produced by the plant. To enrich genomic resources for understanding various pathways, de novo transcriptome sequencing of two important species, O. sanctum and O. basilicum, was carried out by Illumina paired-end sequencing.

RESULTS: The sequence assembly resulted in 69117 and 130043 transcripts with an average length of 1646 ± 1210.1 bp and 1363 ± 1139.3 bp for O. sanctum and O. basilicum, respectively. Out of the total transcripts, 59648 (86.30%) and 105470 (81.10%) from O. sanctum and O. basilicum, and respectively were annotated by uniprot blastx against Arabidopsis, rice and lamiaceae. KEGG analysis identified 501 and 952 transcripts from O. sanctum and O. basilicum, respectively, related to secondary metabolism with higher percentage of transcripts for biosynthesis of terpenoids in O. sanctum and phenylpropanoids in O. basilicum. Higher digital gene expression in O. basilicum was validated through qPCR and correlated to higher essential oil content and chromosome number (O. sanctum, 2n = 16; and O. basilicum, 2n = 48). Several CYP450 (26) and TF (40) families were identified having probable roles in primary and secondary metabolism. Also SSR and SNP markers were identified in the transcriptomes of both species with many SSRs linked to phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathway genes.

CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a comparative transcriptome analysis of Ocimum species and can be utilized to characterize genes related to secondary metabolism, their regulation, and breeding special chemotypes with unique essential oil composition in Ocimum.
25074414	An active supercomplex of NADPH dehydrogenase mediated cyclic electron flow around Photosystem I from the panicle chloroplast of Oryza sativa.	2014	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) plays a crucial role in the protection of plants against oxidative stress. In higher plants, NDH interacts with Photosystem I (PSI) to form an NDH-PSI supercomplex. However, the chloroplast supercomplex with NADPH oxidation activity remains to be identified. Here, we reported the identification of a supercomplex of NDH with NADPH-nitroblue tetrazolium oxidoreductase activity in the chloroplast of rice panicle. The active supercomplex from the panicle chloroplast contained higher amounts of the NDH subunits (NdhH, NdhK, and NdhA) than that from the flag leaf chloroplast. The highly active supercomplex might underlie the high activity of the NADPH-dependent NDH pathway and the larger proton gradient across thylakoid membranes via cyclic electron flow around PSI, as well as the higher maximal photochemical efficiency of Photosystem II at the flowering to grain-filling stage. The supercomplex is suggested to be essential for the high efficiency of photosynthesis and play a protective role in the grain formation in rice plant.
25056987	The effect of platelet-rich plasma on muscle contusion healing in a rat model.	2014	Am J Sports Med	BACKGROUND: Current therapy for muscle contusions is usually limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or use of the RICE principle (rest, ice, compression, elevation); thus, other forms of treatment that can potentially accelerate the rate of healing are desirable.

HYPOTHESES: A local injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) would lead to accelerated healing rates compared with controls; also, delayed administration of PRP would lead to a blunted response compared with immediate treatment.

STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.

METHODS: Forty-six male Lewis rats each underwent a single blunt, nonpenetrating impact to the gastrocnemius muscle via a drop-mass technique and subsequently received either a single injection of saline into the area of injury immediately after injury (controls, n = 11) or rat PRP (either immediately after injury [PRP day 0, n = 12], the first day after injury [PRP day 1, n = 12], or the third day after injury [PRP day 3, n = 11]). The primary outcome was maximal isometric torque strength of the injured muscle, which was assessed before injury as well as on postinjury days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14. All animals were sacrificed on postinjury day 15. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 6 specimens from each group after sacrifice.

RESULTS: The mean platelet concentration in the PRP was 2.19 × 10(6) (±2.69 × 10(5))/μL. The mean white blood cell count in the PRP was 22.54 × 10(3)/μL. Each group demonstrated statistically significant decreases in maximal isometric torque strength after injury when compared with preinjury levels, followed by significant increases back toward baseline values by postinjury day 14 (controls, 90.6% ± 7.90%; PRP day 0, 105.0% ± 7.60%; PRP day 1, 92.4% ± 7.60%; PRP day 3, 77.8% ± 7.90%) (P = .121). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups at any of the time points. There were also no statistically significant differences between any of the groups in the percentage of centronucleated fibers (controls, 3.31% ± 5.10%; PRP day 0, 0.62% ± 1.59%; PRP day 1, 3.24% ± 5.77%; PRP day 3, 2.13% ± 3.26%) (P = .211) or the presence of inflammatory cells and macrophages.

CONCLUSION: In this rat contusion model, a local injection of PRP into the injured gastrocnemius muscle resulted in no significant differences in functional or histological outcomes, indicating no likely benefit to healing. Additionally, there was no significant difference between immediate or delayed administration of PRP.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Before PRP can be recommended for the treatment of muscle contusion injuries, further translational and clinical investigations need to be performed.
24923534	Small kernel 1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for mitochondrial nad7 transcript editing and seed development in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Plant J	RNA editing modifies cytidines (C) to uridines (U) at specific sites in the transcripts of mitochondria and plastids, altering the amino acid specified by the DNA sequence. Here we report the identification of a critical editing factor of mitochondrial nad7 transcript via molecular characterization of a small kernel 1 (smk1) mutant in Zea mays (maize). Mutations in Smk1 arrest both the embryo and endosperm development. Cloning of Smk1 indicates that it encodes an E-subclass pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that is targeted to mitochondria. Loss of SMK1 function abolishes the C → U editing at the nad7-836 site, leading to the retention of a proline codon that is edited to encode leucine in the wild type. The smk1 mutant showed dramatically reduced complex-I assembly and NADH dehydrogenase activity, and abnormal biogenesis of the mitochondria. Analysis of the ortholog in Oryza sativa (rice) reveals that rice SMK1 has a conserved function in C → U editing of the mitochondrial nad7-836 site. T-DNA knock-out mutants showed abnormal embryo and endosperm development, resulting in embryo or seedling lethality. The leucine at NAD7-279 is highly conserved from bacteria to flowering plants, and analysis of genome sequences from many plants revealed a molecular coevolution between the requirement for C → U editing at this site and the existence of an SMK1 homolog. These results demonstrate that Smk1 encodes a PPR-E protein that is required for nad7-836 editing, and this editing is critical to NAD7 function in complex-I assembly in mitochondria, and hence to embryo and endosperm development in maize and rice.
25023870	Annotation of gene function in citrus using gene expression information and co-expression networks.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The genus Citrus encompasses major cultivated plants such as sweet orange, mandarin, lemon and grapefruit, among the world's most economically important fruit crops. With increasing volumes of transcriptomics data available for these species, Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) analysis is a viable option for predicting gene function at a genome-wide scale. GCN analysis is based on a "guilt-by-association" principle whereby genes encoding proteins involved in similar and/or related biological processes may exhibit similar expression patterns across diverse sets of experimental conditions. While bioinformatics resources such as GCN analysis are widely available for efficient gene function prediction in model plant species including Arabidopsis, soybean and rice, in citrus these tools are not yet developed.

RESULTS: We have constructed a comprehensive GCN for citrus inferred from 297 publicly available Affymetrix Genechip Citrus Genome microarray datasets, providing gene co-expression relationships at a genome-wide scale (33,000 transcripts). The comprehensive citrus GCN consists of a global GCN (condition-independent) and four condition-dependent GCNs that survey the sweet orange species only, all citrus fruit tissues, all citrus leaf tissues, or stress-exposed plants. All of these GCNs are clustered using genome-wide, gene-centric (guide) and graph clustering algorithms for flexibility of gene function prediction. For each putative cluster, gene ontology (GO) enrichment and gene expression specificity analyses were performed to enhance gene function, expression and regulation pattern prediction. The guide-gene approach was used to infer novel roles of genes involved in disease susceptibility and vitamin C metabolism, and graph-clustering approaches were used to investigate isoprenoid/phenylpropanoid metabolism in citrus peel, and citric acid catabolism via the GABA shunt in citrus fruit.

CONCLUSIONS: Integration of citrus gene co-expression networks, functional enrichment analysis and gene expression information provide opportunities to infer gene function in citrus. We present a publicly accessible tool, Network Inference for Citrus Co-Expression (NICCE, http://citrus.adelaide.edu.au/nicce/home.aspx), for the gene co-expression analysis in citrus.
25042427	Physiological efects of paichongding applied to rice on the Nilaparvata lugens (Stå l), the brown planthopper.	2014	Arch Insect Biochem Physiol	Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) is a major rice pest in Asia. Paichongding is a novel neonicotinoid insecticide developed in 2008. The effects of this insecticide on the activity of detoxification enzymes of N. lugens and on rice resistance to the pest were examined in the laboratory. The results showed that paichongding could significantly decrease the acetylcholinesterase and GSHs transferase activities of N. lugens. The variation tendency of mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity was similar with that of the esterase. After 12 h treatment, there was no significance between the treatment and control. However, the activities of MFO and esterase increased after 24 and 48 h treatment, which suggested that MFO and esterase may play an important role in the detoxification of paichongding for N. lugens. Our results also demonstrated that treated with paichongding, damage levels of rice plants were significantly lower than those of control plants except 15 days after treatment. Compared with the control, injury indices decreased 70.22, 49.12, 34.44, and 23.23% at 3 , 6 , 9, and 12 days after paichongding treatment, respectively. The laboratory results suggested that paichongding may be effective for the control of brown planthopper.
25014054	Consumption of Bt rice pollen containing Cry1C or Cry2A protein poses a low to negligible risk to the silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombyxidae).	2014	PLoS One	By consuming mulberry leaves covered with pollen from nearby genetically engineered, insect-resistant rice lines producing Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), larvae of the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Bombyxidae), could be exposed to insecticidal proteins. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the potential effects of Cry1C- or Cry2A-producing transgenic rice (T1C-19, T2A-1) pollen on B. mori fitness. In a short-term assay, B. mori larvae were fed mulberry leaves covered with different densities of pollen from Bt rice lines or their corresponding near isoline (control) for the first 3 d and then were fed mulberry leaves without pollen. No effect was detected on any life table parameter, even at 1800 pollen grains/cm(2) leaf, which is much higher than the mean natural density of rice pollen on leaves of mulberry trees near paddy fields. In a long-term assay, the larvae were fed Bt and control pollen in the same way but for their entire larval stage (approximately 27 d). Bt pollen densities ≥ 150 grains/cm(2) leaf reduced 14-d larval weight, increased larval development time, and reduced adult eclosion rate. ELISA analyses showed that 72.6% of the Cry protein was still detected in the pollen grains excreted with the feces. The low exposure of silkworm larvae to Cry proteins when feeding Bt rice pollen may be the explanation for the relatively low toxicity detected in the current study. Although the results demonstrate that B. mori larvae are sensitive to Cry1C and Cry2A proteins, the exposure levels that harmed the larvae in the current study are far greater than natural exposure levels. We therefore conclude that consumption of Bt rice pollen will pose a low to negligible risk to B. mori.
25037078	Increased expression of Fe-chelatase leads to increased metabolic flux into heme and confers protection against photodynamically induced oxidative stress.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Fe-chelatase (FeCh, EC 4.99.1.1) inserts Fe(2+) into protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX) to form heme, which influences the flux through the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway as well as fundamental cellular processes. In transgenic rice (Oryza sativa), the ectopic expression of Bradyrhizobium japonicum FeCh protein in cytosol results in a substantial increase of FeCh activity compared to wild-type (WT) rice and an increasing level of heme. Interestingly, the transgenic rice plants showed resistance to oxidative stress caused not only by the peroxidizing herbicide acifluorfen (AF) as indicated by a reduced formation of leaf necrosis, a lower conductivity, lower malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents as well as sustained Fv/Fm compared to WT plants, but also by norflurazon, paraquat, salt, and polyethylene glycol. Moreover, the transgenic plants responded to AF treatment with markedly increasing FeCh activity. The accompanying increases in heme content and heme oxygenase activity demonstrate that increased heme metabolism attenuates effects of oxidative stress caused by accumulating porphyrins. These findings suggest that increases in heme levels and porphyrin scavenging capacity support a detoxification mechanism serving against porphyrin-induced oxidative stress. This study also implicates heme as possibly being a positive signal in plant stress responses.
25039271	Peroxisomal APX knockdown triggers antioxidant mechanisms favourable for coping with high photorespiratory H2 O2 induced by CAT deficiency in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	The physiological role of peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidases (pAPX) is unknown; therefore, we utilized pAPX4 knockdown rice and catalase (CAT) inhibition to assess its role in CAT compensation under high photorespiration. pAPX4 knockdown induced co-suppression in the expression of pAPX3. The rice mutants exhibited metabolic changes such as lower CAT and glycolate oxidase (GO) activities and reduced glyoxylate content; however, APX activity was not altered. CAT inhibition triggered different changes in the expression of CAT, APX and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) isoforms between non-transformed (NT) and silenced plants. These responses were associated with alterations in APX, GPX and GO activities, suggesting redox homeostasis differences. The glutathione oxidation-reduction states were modulated differently in mutants, and the ascorbate redox state was greatly affected in both genotypes. The pAPX suffered less oxidative stress and photosystem II (PSII) damage and displayed higher photosynthesis than the NT plants. The improved acclimation exhibited by the pAPX plants was indicated by lower H2 O2 accumulation, which was associated with lower GO activity and glyoxylate content. The suppression of both pAPXs and/or its downstream metabolic and molecular effects may trigger favourable antioxidant and compensatory mechanisms to cope with CAT deficiency. This physiological acclimation may involve signalling by peroxisomal H2 O2 , which minimized the photorespiration.
24985701	Plant stress biomarkers from biosimulations: the Transcriptome-To-Metabolome (TTM) technology - effects of drought stress on rice.	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Measuring biomarkers from plant tissue samples is challenging and expensive when the desire is to integrate transcriptomics, fluxomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, physiomics and phenomics. We present a computational biology method where only the transcriptome needs to be measured and is used to derive a set of parameters for deterministic kinetic models of metabolic pathways. The technology is called Transcriptome-To-Metabolome (TTM) biosimulations, currently under commercial development, but available for non-commercial use by researchers. The simulated results on metabolites of 30 primary and secondary metabolic pathways in rice (Oryza sativa) were used as the biomarkers to predict whether the transcriptome was from a plant that had been under drought conditions. The rice transcriptomes were accessed from public archives and each individual plant was simulated. This unique quality of the TTM technology allows standard analyses on biomarker assessments, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two validation methods were also used, the holdout and 10-fold cross validations. Initially 17 metabolites were identified as candidate biomarkers based on either statistical significance on binary phenotype when compared with control samples or recognition from the literature. The top three biomarkers based on AUC were gibberellic acid 12 (0.89), trehalose (0.80) and sn1-palmitate-sn2-oleic-phosphatidylglycerol (0.70). Neither heat map analyses of transcriptomes nor all 300 metabolites clustered the stressed and control groups effectively. The TTM technology allows the emergent properties of the integrated system to generate unique and useful 'Omics' information.
25096975	Auxin perception is required for arbuscule development in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.	2014	Plant Physiol	Most land plant species live in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi differentiate essential functional structures called arbuscules in root cortical cells from which mineral nutrients are released to the plant. We investigated the role of microRNA393 (miR393), an miRNA that targets several auxin receptors, in arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization. Expression of the precursors of the miR393 was down-regulated during mycorrhization in three different plant species: Solanum lycopersicum, Medicago truncatula, and Oryza sativa. Treatment of S. lycopersicum, M. truncatula, and O. sativa roots with concentrations of synthetic auxin analogs that did not affect root development stimulated mycorrhization, particularly arbuscule formation. DR5-GUS, a reporter for auxin response, was preferentially expressed in root cells containing arbuscules. Finally, overexpression of miR393 in root tissues resulted in down-regulation of auxin receptor genes (transport inhibitor response1 and auxin-related F box) and underdeveloped arbuscules in all three plant species. These results support the conclusion that miR393 is a negative regulator of arbuscule formation by hampering auxin perception in arbuscule-containing cells.
25104001	In silico analysis of DREB transcription factor genes and proteins in grasses.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Plants are exposed to various environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, low temperature, etc. Dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) genes, the members of AP2/ERF transcription factor family, regulate the biological processes against cold and dehydration stresses. In this study, we analyzed a total of 19 DREB transcription factor genes and proteins from 14 grass species by using bioinformatic approaches, including their physiochemical properties, conserved motif structures, homology models, and phylogenetic relationships. The domain analysis showed that all grass species contained an AP2 domain whereas some residual substitutions and/or insertions were observed in the AP2 domains of some grasses. The physiochemical analysis revealed that many DREB proteins (89.5 %) were of acidic character while the number of amino acids ranged from 213 (Aegilops speltoides subsp. speltoides) to 394 (Triticum aestivum). Based on the subcellular prediction, 16 of 19 DREB proteins were predicted to be localized in the nuclear region. According to the sequence analysis of grass DREBs, the average value of pairwise distance was found to be 0.588, while nucleotide diversity (π) was found to be 0.435. Thus, among all DREB proteins, two most divergent ones (Oryza sativa and Avena sativa) were selected for 3D structure and protein cavity comparison. In addition, 19 DREB proteins were analyzed according to their phylogenetic relationships, and as a consequence, two main groups were observed. In this study, our analyses could be a scientific base to understand DREB genes and proteins to further wet lab studies in plants, particularly in grass species.
25100144	Conserved structure and varied expression reveal key roles of phosphoglucan phosphatase gene starch excess 4 in barley.	2014	Planta	As one of the phosphoglucan phosphatases, starch excess 4 (SEX4) encoded by SEX4 gene has recently been intensively studied because of its vital role in the degradation of leaf starch. In this study, we isolated and chromosomally mapped barley SEX4, characterized its gene and protein structure, predicted the cis-elements of its promoter, and analysed its expression based on real-time quantitative PCR and publically available microarray data. The full length of barely SEX4 (HvSEX4) was 4,598 bp and it was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4H (4HL). This gene contained 14 exons and 13 introns in all but two of the species analysed, Arabidopsis (13 exons and 12 introns) and Oryza brachyantha (12 exons and 11 introns). An exon-intron junction composed of intron 4 to intron 7 and exon 5 to exon 8 was highly conserved among the analysed species. SEX4 is characterized with conserved functional domains (dual specificity phosphatase domain and carbohydrate-binding module 48) and varied chloroplast transit peptide and C-terminal. Expression analyses indicated that: (1) SEX4 was mainly expressed in anthers of barley, young leaf and anthers of rice, and leaf of Arabidopsis; (2) it exhibited a diurnal pattern in barley, rice and Arabidopsis; (3) significant difference in the expression of SEX4 was not detected for either barley or rice under any of the investigated stresses; and (4) it was significantly down-regulated at middle stage and up-regulated at late stage under cold treatment, down-regulated at early stage under heat treatment, and up-regulated at late stage under salt treatment in Arabidopsis. The strong relationships detected in the current study between SEX4 and glucan, water dikinases (GWD) or phosphoglucan, water dikinases (PWD) were discussed. Collectively, our results provide insights into genetic manipulation of SEX4, especially in monocotyledon and uncovering the possible roles of SEX4 in plant development.
25149470	A novel protein elicitor (SsCut) from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum induces multiple defense responses in plants.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	In this study, we report the cloning of the SsCut gene encoding cutinase from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. We isolated a 609-bp cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 202 amino acids with a molecular weight of 20.4 kDa. Heterologous expression of SsCut in Escherichia coli (His-SsCut) caused the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resembled hypersensitive response lesions. Mutational analysis identified the C-terminal-half peptide and the same amino acids indispensable for both enzyme and elicitor activity. His-SsCut was caused cell death in Arabidopsis, soybean (Glycine max), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), indicating that both dicot and monocot species are responsive to the elicitor. Furthermore, the elicitation of tobacco was effective in the induction of the activities of hydrogen peroxide, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxides, and polyphenol oxidase. His-SsCut-treated plants exhibited enhanced resistance as indicated by a significant reduction in the number and size of S. sclerotiorum, Phytophthora sojae, and P. nicotianae lesions on leaves relative to controls. Real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of defense-related genes and genes involved in signal transduction were induced by His-SsCut. Our results demonstrate that SsCut is an elicitor that triggers defense responses in plants and will help to clarify its relationship to downstream signaling pathways that induce defense responses.
25157851	Transcriptome wide identification and validation of calcium sensor gene family in the developing spikes of finger millet genotypes for elucidating its role in grain calcium accumulation.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: In finger millet, calcium is one of the important and abundant mineral elements. The molecular mechanisms involved in calcium accumulation in plants remains poorly understood. Transcriptome sequencing of genetically diverse genotypes of finger millet differing in grain calcium content will help in understanding the trait.

PRINCIPAL FINDING: In this study, the transcriptome sequencing of spike tissues of two genotypes of finger millet differing in their grain calcium content, were performed for the first time. Out of 109,218 contigs, 78 contigs in case of GP-1 (Low Ca genotype) and out of 120,130 contigs 76 contigs in case of GP-45 (High Ca genotype), were identified as calcium sensor genes. Through in silico analysis all 82 unique calcium sensor genes were classified into eight calcium sensor gene family viz., CaM & CaMLs, CBLs, CIPKs, CRKs, PEPRKs, CDPKs, CaMKs and CCaMK. Out of 82 genes, 12 were found diverse from the rice orthologs. The differential expression analysis on the basis of FPKM value resulted in 24 genes highly expressed in GP-45 and 11 genes highly expressed in GP-1. Ten of the 35 differentially expressed genes could be assigned to three documented pathways involved mainly in stress responses. Furthermore, validation of selected calcium sensor responder genes was also performed by qPCR, in developing spikes of both genotypes grown on different concentration of exogenous calcium.

CONCLUSION: Through de novo transcriptome data assembly and analysis, we reported the comprehensive identification and functional characterization of calcium sensor gene family. The calcium sensor gene family identified and characterized in this study will facilitate in understanding the molecular basis of calcium accumulation and development of calcium biofortified crops. Moreover, this study also supported that identification and characterization of gene family through Illumina paired-end sequencing is a potential tool for generating the genomic information of gene family in non-model species.
25133580	Expression of wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit 1Bx is affected by large insertions and deletions located in the upstream flanking sequences.	2014	PLoS One	To better understand the transcriptional regulation of high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) expression, we isolated four Glu-1Bx promoters from six wheat cultivars exhibiting diverse protein expression levels. The activities of the diverse Glu-1Bx promoters were tested and compared with β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter fusions. Although all the full-length Glu-1Bx promoters showed endosperm-specific activities, the strongest GUS activity was observed with the 1Bx7OE promoter in both transient expression assays and stable transgenic rice lines. A 43 bp insertion in the 1Bx7OE promoter, which is absent in the 1Bx7 promoter, led to enhanced expression. Analysis of promoter deletion constructs confirmed that a 185 bp MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable element) in the 1Bx14 promoter had a weak positive effect on Glu-1Bx expression, and a 54 bp deletion in the 1Bx13 promoter reduced endosperm-specific activity. To investigate the effect of the 43 bp insertion in the 1Bx7OE promoter, a functional marker was developed to screen 505 Chinese varieties and 160 European varieties, and only 1Bx7-type varieties harboring the 43 bp insertion in their promoters showed similar overexpression patterns. Hence, the 1Bx7OE promoter should be important tool in crop genetic engineering as well as in molecular assisted breeding.
25162680	Genetic analysis and QTL detection for resistance to white tip disease in rice.	2014	PLoS One	The inheritance of resistance to white tip disease (WTDR) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed with an artificial inoculation test in a segregating population derived from the cross between Tetep, a highly resistant variety that was identified in a previous study, and a susceptible cultivar. Three resistance-associated traits, including the number of Aphelenchoides besseyi (A. besseyi) individuals in 100 grains (NA), the loss rate of panicle weight (LRPW) and the loss rate of the total grains per panicle (LRGPP) were analyzed for the detection of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) in the population after construction of a genetic map. Six QTLs distributed on chromosomes 3, 5 and 9 were mapped. qNA3 and qNA9, conferring reproduction number of A. besseyi in the panicle, accounted for 16.91% and 12.54% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. qDRPW5a and qDRPW5b, associated with yield loss, were located at two adjacent marker intervals on chromosome 5 and explained 14.15% and 14.59% of the total phenotypic variation and possessed LOD values of 3.40 and 3.39, respectively. qDRPW9 was considered as a minor QTL and only explained 1.02% of the phenotypic variation. qLRGPP5 contributed to the loss in the number of grains and explained 10.91% of the phenotypic variation. This study provides useful information for the breeding of resistant cultivars against white tip disease in rice.
25122481	Interactions of Rice tungro bacilliform pararetrovirus and its protein P4 with plant RNA-silencing machinery.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed gene silencing plays a major role in antiviral defense. Virus-derived siRNAs inhibit viral replication in infected cells and potentially move to neighboring cells, immunizing them from incoming virus. Viruses have evolved various ways to evade and suppress siRNA production or action. Here, we show that 21-, 22-, and 24-nucleotide (nt) viral siRNAs together constitute up to 19% of total small RNA population of Oryza sativa plants infected with Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and cover both strands of the RTBV DNA genome. However, viral siRNA hotspots are restricted to a short noncoding region between transcription and reverse-transcription start sites. This region generates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors of siRNAs and, in pregenomic RNA, forms a stable secondary structure likely inaccessible to siRNA-directed cleavage. In transient assays, RTBV protein P4 suppressed cell-to-cell spread of silencing but enhanced cell-autonomous silencing, which correlated with reduced 21-nt siRNA levels and increased 22-nt siRNA levels. Our findings imply that RTBV generates decoy dsRNA that restricts siRNA production to the structured noncoding region and thereby protects other regions of the viral genome from repressive action of siRNAs, while the viral protein P4 interferes with cell-to-cell spread of antiviral silencing.
25093500	Application of two newly identified and characterized feruloyl esterases from Streptomyces sp. in the enzymatic production of ferulic acid from agricultural biomass.	2014	PLoS One	Ferulic acid (FA), a component of hemicellulose in plant cell walls, is a phenolic acid with several potential applications based on its antioxidant properties. Recent studies have shown that feruloyl esterase (FAE) is a key bacterial enzyme involved in FA production from agricultural biomass. In this study, we screened a library of 43 esterases from Streptomyces species and identified two enzymes, R18 and R43, that have FAE activity toward ethyl ferulate. In addition, we characterized their enzyme properties in detail. R18 and R43 showed esterase activity toward other hydroxycinnamic acid esters as well, such as methyl p-coumarate, methyl caffeate, and methyl sinapinate. The amino acid sequences of R18 and R43 were neither similar to each other, nor to other FAEs. We found that R18 and R43 individually showed the ability to produce FA from corn bran; however, combination with other Streptomyces enzymes, namely xylanase and α-l-arabinofuranosidase, increased FA production from biomass such as corn bran, defatted rice bran, and wheat bran. These results suggest that R18 and R43 are effective FAEs for the enzymatic production of FA from biomass.
25168432	Isolation and functional characterization of a high affinity urea transporter from roots of Zea mays.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Despite its extensive use as a nitrogen fertilizer, the role of urea as a directly accessible nitrogen source for crop plants is still poorly understood. So far, the physiological and molecular aspects of urea acquisition have been investigated only in few plant species highlighting the importance of a high-affinity transport system. With respect to maize, a worldwide-cultivated crop requiring high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer, the mechanisms involved in the transport of urea have not yet been identified. The aim of the present work was to characterize the high-affinity urea transport system in maize roots and to identify the high affinity urea transporter.

RESULTS: Kinetic characterization of urea uptake (<300 μM) demonstrated the presence in maize roots of a high-affinity and saturable transport system; this system is inducible by urea itself showing higher Vmax and Km upon induction. At molecular level, the ORF sequence coding for the urea transporter, ZmDUR3, was isolated and functionally characterized using different heterologous systems: a dur3 yeast mutant strain, tobacco protoplasts and a dur3 Arabidopsis mutant. The expression of the isolated sequence, ZmDUR3-ORF, in dur3 yeast mutant demonstrated the ability of the encoded protein to mediate urea uptake into cells. The subcellular targeting of DUR3/GFP fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts gave results comparable to the localization of the orthologous transporters of Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting a partial localization at the plasma membrane. Moreover, the overexpression of ZmDUR3 in the atdur3-3 Arabidopsis mutant showed to complement the phenotype, since different ZmDUR3-overexpressing lines showed either comparable or enhanced 15[N]-urea influx than wild-type plants. These data provide a clear evidence in planta for a role of ZmDUR3 in urea acquisition from an extra-radical solution.

CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the capability of maize plants to take up urea via an inducible and high-affinity transport system. ZmDUR3 is a high-affinity urea transporter mediating the uptake of this molecule into roots. Data may provide a key to better understand the mechanisms involved in urea acquisition and contribute to deepen the knowledge on the overall nitrogen-use efficiency in crop plants.
25129550	α-linolenic acid concentration and not wounding per se is the key regulator of octadecanoid (oxylipin) pathway activity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Using an in vitro system composed of crushed leaf tissues to simulate the wounding response in rice leaves, we established that synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile) can only occur in unwounded tissue and, in wounded tissue, that only the chloroplast-located section of the octadecanoid pathway is active, resulting in the accumulation of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). We further showed that OPDA accumulation in vitro was inhibited by 90% using the general lipase inhibitor, tetrahydrolipstatin, indicating that production of α-linolenic acid was the rate-limiting step in octadecanoid pathway activity in rice following wounding and the enzyme capacity for an active pathway was already present. We confirmed this result by showing that added α-linolenic acid stimulated OPDA synthesis in vitro and stimulated OPDA, JA and JA-Ile synthesis in vivo in unwounded tissue. Thus, the response to wounding can be mimicked by the provision of free α-linolenic acid. Our results draw attention to the key importance of lipase activity in initiation of JA and JA-Ile biosynthesis and our lack of knowledge of the cognate lipase(s), lipase substrate identity and mechanism(s) of activation in wounded and unwounded tissue.
25137124	Bioinformatic indications that COPI- and clathrin-based transport systems are not present in chloroplasts: an Arabidopsis model.	2014	PLoS One	Coated vesicle transport occurs in the cytosol of yeast, mammals and plants. It consists of three different transport systems, the COPI, COPII and clathrin coated vesicles (CCV), all of which participate in the transfer of proteins and lipids between different cytosolic compartments. There are also indications that chloroplasts have a vesicle transport system. Several putative chloroplast-localized proteins, including CPSAR1 and CPRabA5e with similarities to cytosolic COPII transport-related proteins, were detected in previous experimental and bioinformatics studies. These indications raised the hypothesis that a COPI- and/or CCV-related system may be present in chloroplasts, in addition to a COPII-related system. To test this hypothesis we bioinformatically searched for chloroplast proteins that may have similar functions to known cytosolic COPI and CCV components in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (subsp. japonica) (rice). We found 29 such proteins, based on domain similarity, in Arabidopsis, and 14 in rice. However, many components could not be identified and among the identified most have assigned roles that are not related to either COPI or CCV transport. We conclude that COPII is probably the only active vesicle system in chloroplasts, at least in the model plants. The evolutionary implications of the findings are discussed.
25129148	Influence of transgenic rice expressing a fused Cry1Ab/1Ac protein on frogs in paddy fields.	2014	Ecotoxicology	As genetic engineering in plants is increasingly used to control agricultural pests, it is important to determine whether such transgenic plants adversely affect non-target organisms within and around cultivated fields. The cry1Ab/1Ac fusion gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has insecticidal activity and has been introduced into rice line Minghui 63 (MH63). We evaluated the effect of transgenic cry1Ab/1Ac rice (Huahui 1, HH1) on paddy frogs by comparing HH1 and MH63 rice paddies with and without pesticide treatment. The density of tadpoles in rice fields was surveyed at regular intervals, and Cry1Ab/1Ac protein levels were determined in tissues of tadpoles and froglets collected from the paddy fields. In addition, Rana nigromaculata froglets were raised in purse nets placed within these experimental plots. The survival, body weight, feeding habits, and histological characteristics of the digestive tract of these froglets were analyzed. We found that the tadpole density was significantly decreased immediately after pesticide application, and the weight of R. nigromaculata froglets of pesticide groups was significantly reduced compared with no pesticide treatment, but we found no differences between Bt and non-Bt rice groups. Moreover, no Cry1Ab/1Ac protein was detected in tissue samples collected from 192 tadpoles and froglets representing all four experimental groups. In addition, R. nigromaculata froglets raised in purse seines fed primarily on stem borer and non-target insects, and showed no obvious abnormality in the microstructure of their digestive tracts. Based on these results, we conclude that cultivation of transgenic cry1Ab/1Ac rice does not adversely affect paddy frogs.
25258710	Molecular characterization and screening for sheath blight resistance using Malaysian isolates of Rhizoctonia solani.	2014	Biomed Res Int	Two field isolates of Rhizoctonia solani were isolated from infected paddy plants in Malaysia. These isolates were verified via ITS-rDNA analysis that yielded ~720 bp products of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS4 region, respectively. The sequenced products showed insertion and substitution incidences which may result in strain diversity and possible variation in disease severity. These strains showed some regional and host-specific relatedness via Maximum Likelihood and further phylogenetic analysis via Maximum Parsimony showed that these strains were closely related to R. solani AG1-1A (with 99-100% identity). Subsequent to strain verification and analysis, these isolates were used in the screening of twenty rice varieties for tolerance or resistance to sheath blight via mycelial plug method where both isolates (1801 and 1802) showed resistance or moderate resistance to Teqing, TETEP, and Jasmine 85. Isolate 1802 was more virulent based on the disease severity index values. This study also showed that the mycelial plug techniques were efficient in providing uniform inoculum and humidity for screening. In addition this study shows that the disease severity index is a better mode of scoring for resistance compared to lesion length. These findings will provide a solid basis for our future breeding and screening activities at the institution.
25105299	Transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice is safer to aquatic ecosystems than its non-transgenic counterpart.	2014	PLoS One	Rice lines genetically modified with the crystal toxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have experienced rapid development, with biosafety certificates for two Bt rice lines issued in 2009. There has still been no commercial release of these lines yet due to public concerns about human health and environmental risks. Some studies confirmed that Bt rice was as safe as conventional rice to non-target organisms when pesticides were not applied, however, pesticides are still required in Bt rice to control non-lepidopteran pests. In this study, we assessed the environmental effects of two Bt rice lines expressing either the cry1Ab/1Ac or cry2A genes, respectively, by using zooplanktons as indicator species under normal field management practices using pesticides when required. In the whole rice growing season, non-Bt rice was sprayed 5 times while Bt rice was sprayed 2 times, which ensured both rice achieved a normal yield. Field investigations showed that rice type (Bt and non-Bt) significantly influenced zooplankton abundance and diversity, which were up to 95% and 80% lower in non-Bt rice fields than Bt rice fields. Laboratory rearing showed that water from non-Bt rice fields was significantly less suitable for the survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna and Paramecium caudatum in comparison with water from Bt rice fields. Higher pesticide residues were detected in the water from non-Bt than Bt rice fields, accounting for the bad performance of zooplankton in non-Bt field water. Our results demonstrate that Bt rice is safer to aquatic ecosystems than non-Bt rice, and its commercialization will be beneficial for biodiversity restoration in rice-based ecosystems.
25338392	[Effects of phosphorus-containing substances on arsenic uptake by rice].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The disodium hydrogen phosphate (DSP) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) were added into arsenic contaminated soil, then rice pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of phosphorus (P)-containing substances on arsenic (As) uptake by rice. The results showed that: DSP and HAP significantly increased soil pH and the contents of available P in soil (P < 0.05), activating soil arsenic. And DSP was stronger than HAP in improving the migration ability of As in soil. DSP and HAP treatments both significantly reduced the contents of total As in root, as well as total As and inorganic As in brown rice. But HAP significantly increased total As contents in stem. DSP and HAP treatments had better reducing effects on inorganic As than on total As in brown rice. And DSP had the same reducing effects as HAP on total As and inorganic As in brown rice. Analysis results showed that the contents of As in rice were affected by the antagonism between P and As and the increase of As bio-availability in soil. The antagonism played the major role in this study and it was clearly exhibited in both root and rice. Lower dosage (< or = 0.12 g x kg(-1)) of DSP and HAP increased total biomass of rice and brown rice yield, but with the increase of P addition, the two kinds of P-containing substances obviously inhibited the growth of rice, and inhibition by HAP was relatively light.
25143195	Absorption, translocation and metabolism of bispyribac-sodium on rice seedlings under cold stress.	2015	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Rice production is highly affected by weed competition. The efficacy of chemical weed control and crop safety is a function of absorption, translocation and metabolism of herbicides. This study investigates the effect of cold stress 22/16 °C (day/night) on absorption, translocation and metabolism of (14)C-bispyribac-sodium on rice seedlings.

RESULTS: Maximum (14)C-bispyribac-sodium absorption occurred at 24 h after herbicide treatment and was stimulated by the warm 30/22 °C (day/night) temperature. A large amount of total absorbed herbicide was retained in the treated leaf, indicating that bispyribac-sodium had minimal translocation to other plant parts. Piperonyl-butoxide (a P450 inhibitor) plus herbicide caused greater injury than the herbicide alone. In addition, injury on rice plants was enhanced by exposure to cold, emphasizing the negative effect on herbicide metabolism. In the thin-layer chromatography metabolism experiment, cold-grown plants had higher injury and retained more of the parent herbicide than plants grown at a warm temperature.

CONCLUSION: Cold stress reduces bispyribac-sodium absorption and metabolism in rice, but has no effect on translocation.
25111805	Responses of super rice (Oryza sativa L.) to different planting methods for grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency in the single cropping season.	2014	PLoS One	To break the yield ceiling of rice production, a super rice project was developed in 1996 to breed rice varieties with super high yield. A two-year experiment was conducted to evaluate yield and nitrogen (N)-use response of super rice to different planting methods in the single cropping season. A total of 17 rice varieties, including 13 super rice and four non-super checks (CK), were grown under three N levels [0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 225 (N225) kg ha-1] and two planting methods [transplanting (TP) and direct-seeding in wet conditions (WDS)]. Grain yield under WDS (7.69 t ha-1) was generally lower than TP (8.58 t ha-1). However, grain yield under different planting methods was affected by N rates as well as variety groups. In both years, there was no difference in grain yield between super and CK varieties at N150, irrespective of planting methods. However, grain yield difference was dramatic in japonica groups at N225, that is, there was an 11.3% and 14.1% average increase in super rice than in CK varieties in WDS and TP, respectively. This suggests that high N input contributes to narrowing the yield gap in super rice varieties, which also indicates that super rice was bred for high fertility conditions. In the japonica group, more N was accumulated in super rice than in CK at N225, but no difference was found between super and CK varieties at N0 and N150. Similar results were also found for N agronomic efficiency. The results suggest that super rice varieties have an advantage for N-use efficiency when high N is applied. The response of super rice was greater under TP than under WDS. The results suggest that the need to further improve agronomic and other management practices to achieve high yield and N-use efficiency for super rice varieties in WDS.
25132047	Salt-stress induced modulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis during de-etiolation of rice seedlings.	2015	Physiol Plant	Chlorophyll biosynthesis in plants is subjected to modulation by various environmental factors. To understand the modulation of the chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis during greening process by salt, 100-200 mM NaCl was applied to the roots of etiolated rice seedlings 12 h prior to the transfer to light. Application of 200 mM NaCl to rice seedlings that were grown in light for further 72 h resulted in reduced dry matter production (-58%) and Chl accumulation (-66%). Ionic imbalance due to salinity stress resulted in additional downregulation (41-45%) of seedling dry weight, Chl and carotenoid contents over and above that of similar osmotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol. Downregulation of Chl biosynthesis may be attributed to decreased activities of Chl biosynthetic pathway enzymes, i.e. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (EC-2.4.1.24), porphobilinogen deaminase (EC-4.3.1.8), coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (EC-1.3.3.3), protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (EC-1.3.3.4), Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (EC-6.6.1.1) and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (EC-1.3.33.1). Reduced enzymatic activities were due to downregulation of their protein abundance and/or gene expression in salt-stressed seedlings. The extent of downregulation of ALA biosynthesis nearly matched with that of protochlorophyllide and Chl to prevent the accumulation of highly photosensitive photodynamic tetrapyrroles that generates singlet oxygen under stress conditions. Although, ALA synthesis decreased, the gene/protein expression of glutamyl-tRNA reductase (EC-1.2.1.70) increased suggesting it may play a role in acclimation to salt stress. The similar downregulation of both early and late Chl biosynthesis intermediates in salt-stressed seedlings suggests a regulatory network of genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis.
25150455	Impact of agronomic practices on arsenic accumulation and speciation in rice grain.	2014	Environ Pollut	Rice is a major source of dietary arsenic (As). The effects of paddy water management, straw incorporation, the applications of nitrogen fertilizer or organic manure, and the additions of biochar on arsenic accumulation and speciation in rice grain were investigated under field conditions over four cropping seasons in Hunan, China. Treatments that promoted anaerobic conditions in the soil, including continuous flooding and straw incorporation, significantly increased the concentration of As, especially methylated As species, in rice grain, whereas N application rate and biochar additions had little or inconsistent effect. Continuous flooding and straw incorporation also increased the abundance of the arsenite methyltransferase gene arsM in the soil, potentially enhancing As methylation in the soil and the uptake of methylated As by rice plants. Intermittent flooding was an effective method to decrease As accumulation in rice grain.
20825577	OsRAN2, essential for mitosis, enhances cold tolerance in rice by promoting export of intranuclear tubulin and maintaining cell division under cold stress.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	With global climate change, abnormally low temperatures have affected the world's rice production. Many genes have been shown to be essential for molecular improvement of rice cold-tolerance traits. However, less is known about the molecular cellular mechanism of their response to cold stress. Here, we investigated OsRAN2 involved in regulation of cell division during cold stress in rice. Expression of OsRAN2 was increased under cold treatment, but not during salt and drought stress. The mean root mitotic index was closely related to the expression level of OsRAN2. Knockdown transgenic rice lines showed an aberrant organization of spindles during mitosis and stunted growth during development. Overexpression of OsRAN2 enhanced cold tolerance in rice. The transgenic rice overexpressing OsRAN2 showed maintained cell division, decreased proportion of cells with intranuclear tubulin and formation of a normal nuclear envelope under the cold condition. Our study suggests a mechanism for OsRAN2 in regulating cold resistance in rice by maintaining cell division through promoting the normal export of intranuclear tubulin at the end of mitosis. This insight could help improve the cold-tolerance trait in rice.
11910009	Rice SPK, a calmodulin-like domain protein kinase, is required for storage product accumulation during seed development: phosphorylation of sucrose synthase is a possible factor.	2002	Plant Cell	Suc, an end product of photosynthesis, is metabolized by Suc synthase in sink organs as an initial step in the biosynthesis of storage products. Suc synthase activity is known to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation, but the details of this process are unclear at present. Rice SPK, a calcium-dependent protein kinase, is expressed uniquely in the endosperm of immature seed, and its involvement in the biosynthetic pathways of storage products was suggested. Antisense SPK transformants lacked the ability to accumulate storage products such as starch, but produced watery seed with a large amount of Suc instead, as the result of an inhibition of Suc degradation. Analysis of in vitro phosphorylation indicated that SPK phosphorylated specifically a Ser residue in Suc synthase that has been shown to be important for its activity in the degradation of Suc. This finding suggests that SPK is involved in the activation of Suc synthase. It appears that SPK is a Suc synthase kinase that may be important for supplying substrates for the biosynthesis of storage products.
21167079	Expression profiling and integrative analysis of the CESA/CSL superfamily in rice.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like gene superfamily (CESA/CSL) is proposed to encode enzymes for cellulose and non-cellulosic matrix polysaccharide synthesis in plants. Although the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome has been sequenced for a few years, the global expression profiling patterns and functions of the OsCESA/CSL superfamily remain largely unknown.

RESULTS: A total of 45 identified members of OsCESA/CSL were classified into two clusters based on phylogeny and motif constitution. Duplication events contributed largely to the expansion of this superfamily, with Cluster I and II mainly attributed to tandem and segmental duplication, respectively. With microarray data of 33 tissue samples covering the entire life cycle of rice, fairly high OsCESA gene expression and rather variable OsCSL expression were observed. While some members from each CSL family (A1, C9, D2, E1, F6 and H1) were expressed in all tissues examined, many of OsCSL genes were expressed in specific tissues (stamen and radicles). The expression pattern of OsCESA/CSL and OsBC1L which extensively co-expressed with OsCESA/CSL can be divided into three major groups with ten subgroups, each showing a distinct co-expression in tissues representing typically distinct cell wall constitutions. In particular, OsCESA1, -3 & -8 and OsCESA4, -7 & -9 were strongly co-expressed in tissues typical of primary and secondary cell walls, suggesting that they form as a cellulose synthase complex; these results are similar to the findings in Arabidopsis. OsCESA5/OsCESA6 is likely partially redundant with OsCESA3 for OsCESA complex organization in the specific tissues (plumule and radicle). Moreover, the phylogenetic comparison in rice, Arabidopsis and other species can provide clues for the prediction of orthologous gene expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS: The study characterized the CESA/CSL of rice using an integrated approach comprised of phylogeny, transcriptional profiling and co-expression analyses. These investigations revealed very useful clues on the major roles of CESA/CSL, their potentially functional complement and their associations for appropriate cell wall synthesis in higher plants.
17689048	Plant cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases: structure, function, and molecular evolution.	2007	Genomics	A detailed analysis of the structure and function, along with evolutionary aspects, of the main plant cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases (C5-MTases) is presented. The evolutionary relationships between the already known and four candidate plant C5-MTases identified in this work were investigated using the distance, maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood approaches. The topologies of the trees were overall congruent: four monophyletic groups corresponding to the four plant C5-MTase families were clearly distinguished. In addition, sequence analyses of the plant C5-MTase target recognition domain sequences were performed and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed showing that there is good conservation among but not within the plant C5-MTase families. Furthermore, a conserved dipeptide that plays an important role in flipping the target base into the catalytic site of the C5-MTases was identified in all plant C5-MTases under study.
23989647	Copy number polymorphism in plant genomes.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	Copy number variants (CNVs) are genomic rearrangements resulting from gains or losses of DNA segments. Typically, the term refers to rearrangements of sequences larger than 1 kb. This type of polymorphism has recently been shown to be a key contributor to intra-species genetic variation, along with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Over the last decade, a growing number of studies have highlighted the importance of copy number variation (CNV) as a factor affecting human phenotype and individual CNVs have been linked to risks for severe diseases. In plants, the exploration of the extent and role of CNV is still just beginning. Initial genomic analyses indicate that CNVs are prevalent in plants and have greatly affected plant genome evolution. Many CNV events have been observed in outcrossing and autogamous species. CNVs are usually found on all chromosomes, with CNV hotspots interspersed with regions of very low genetic variation. Although CNV is mainly associated with intergenic regions, many CNVs encompass protein-coding genes. The collected data suggest that CNV mainly affects the members of large families of functionally redundant genes. Thus, the effects of individual CNV events on phenotype are usually modest. Nevertheless, there are many cases in which CNVs for specific genes have been linked to important traits such as flowering time, plant height and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Recent reports suggest that CNVs may form rapidly in response to stress.

12596875	Molecular characterization of the gene encoding rice allene oxide synthase and its expression.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The gene encoding rice allene oxide synthase, OsAOS, was intronless and had nucleotide sequences with the high GC content of 67%. Deduced amino acid sequences had very high similarity with other AOS proteins, in particular 74% similarity to barley, characterized by the conserved motifs of P450 cytochrome of the CYP74A family. Purified recombinant rice AOS protein expressed in Escherichia coli converted 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid to allene oxide. Several restriction enzyme digestions and Southern analysis showed that OsAOS was likely to have two copies in its genome. The basal level of OsAOS expression was detected in various tissues and the transcription level was increased by jasmonate treatment.
14988482	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.
15598797	The Rice COLEOPTILE PHOTOTROPISM1 gene encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis NPH3 is required for phototropism of coleoptiles and lateral translocation of auxin.	2005	Plant Cell	We isolated a mutant, named coleoptile phototropism1 (cpt1), from gamma-ray-mutagenized japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa). This mutant showed no coleoptile phototropism and severely reduced root phototropism after continuous stimulation. A map-based cloning strategy and transgenic complementation test were applied to demonstrate that a NPH3-like gene deleted in the mutant corresponds to CPT1. Phylogenetic analysis of putative CPT1 homologs of rice and related proteins indicated that CPT1 has an orthologous relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana NPH3. These results, along with those for Arabidopsis, demonstrate that NPH3/CPT1 is a key signal transduction component of higher plant phototropism. In an extended study with the cpt1 mutant, it was found that phototropic differential growth is accompanied by a CPT1-independent inhibition of net growth. Kinetic investigation further indicated that a small phototropism occurs in cpt1 coleoptiles. This response, induced only transiently, was thought to be caused by the CPT1-independent growth inhibition. The 3H-indole-3-acetic acid applied to the coleoptile tip was asymmetrically distributed between the two sides of phototropically responding coleoptiles. However, no asymmetry was induced in cpt1 coleoptiles, indicating that lateral translocation of auxin occurs downstream of CPT1. It is concluded that the CPT1-dependent major phototropism of coleoptiles is achieved by lateral auxin translocation and subsequent growth redistribution.
10586516	Identification of cDNA encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5c (COX5c) from rice: comparison of its expression with nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded COX genes.	1999	Genes Genet Syst	Little is presently known about the nuclear-encoded genes for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in higher plants. In rice, only the nuclear-encoded COX5b gene has been reported. To understand the relationship between the expression of nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded COX genes in rice, we first characterized a cDNA encoding one of the other nuclear COX genes, COX5c, which encodes 63 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of COX5c from rice was highly homologous to that from sweet potato. Genomic Southern hybridization indicated that the rice COX5c subunit is encoded by a single copy of the COX5c gene. Furthermore, we compared the expression patterns of the nuclear-encoded COX5c and COX5b genes with the expression pattern of the mitochondrial-encoded COX1 gene among several organs by Northern blot analysis. The results suggested that regulatory systems of expression between the nuclear-encoded and the mitochondrial-encoded COX genes are different among different organs in rice.
10659772	Sequence analysis of a rice BAC covering the syntenous barley Rpg1 region	1999	Genome	In the course of map-based cloning of the barley stem rust resistance gene Rpg1, we identified a rice bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the Rpg1 flanking markers. Based on the excellent gene order colinearity between barley and rice in this region, we expected that this rice BAC would contain the barley Rpg1 homologue. In order to identify the putative rice homologue, we sequenced ca. 35 kb of the rice BAC at random and then an additional 33 kb of contiguous sequence between the two most closely spaced Rpg1 flanking markers. Sequence analysis revealed a total of 15 putative genes, 5 within the 33-kb contiguous region. A rice Rpg1 homologue was not identified, although a gene encoding a hypothetical polypeptide with similarity to a membrane protein could not be eliminated as a candidate. Surprisingly, four of the genes identified in the 33-kb contiguous rice sequence showed a high degree of similarity with genes on Arabidopsis chromosome 4. The genome regions harboring these genes showed some relatedness, but many rearrangements were also evident. These data suggest that some genes have remained linked even over the long evolutionary separation of Arabidopsis and rice, as has also been reported for mammals and invertebrates.
9112770	The glossy1 locus of maize and an epidermis-specific cDNA from Kleinia odora define a class of receptor-like proteins required for the normal accumulation of cuticular waxes.	1997	Plant Physiol	Mutations at the glossy1 (gl1) locus of maize (Zea mays L.) quantitatively and qualitatively affect the deposition of cuticular waxes on the surface of seedling leaves. The gl1 locus has been molecularly cloned by transposon tagging with the Mutator transposon system. The epi23 cDNA was isolated by subtractive hybridization as an epidermis-specific mRNA from Senecio odora (Kleinia odora). The deduced amino acid sequence of the GL1 and EPI23 proteins are very similar to each other and to two other plant proteins in which the sequences were deduced from their respective mRNAs. These are the Arabidopsis CER1 protein, which is involved in cuticular wax deposition on siliques, stems, and leaves of that plant, and the protein coded by the rice expressed sequence tag RICS2751A. All four proteins are predicted to be localized in a membrane via a common NH2-terminal domain, which consists of either five or seven membrane-spanning helices. The COOH-terminal portion of each of these proteins, although less conserved, is predicted to be a water-soluble, globular domain. These sequence similarities indicate that these plant orthologs may belong to a superfamily of membrane-bound receptors that have been extensively characterized from animals, including the HIV co-receptor fusin (also termed CXCR4).

10571893	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase is a novel protein kinase regulated at the level of expression.	1999	Plant J	Phosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase plays a key role in the control of plant metabolism. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase is a Ca2+-independent enzyme that is activated by a process involving protein synthesis in response to a range of signals in different plant tissues. The component whose synthesis is required for activation has not previously been identified, nor has the kinase been characterised at a molecular level. We report the cloning of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase from the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism plant KalanchoÃ« fedtschenkoi and the C3 plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Surprisingly, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase is a member of the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated group of protein kinases. However, it lacks the auto-inhibitory region and EF hands of plant Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, explaining its Ca2+-independence. Its sequence is novel in that it comprises only a protein kinase catalytic domain with no regulatory regions; it appears to be the smallest known protein kinase. In K. fedtschenkoi, the abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase transcripts increases during leaf development. The transcript level in mature leaves is very low during the photoperiod, reaches a peak in the middle of the dark period and correlates with kinase activity. It exhibits a circadian oscillation in constant conditions. Protein kinases are typically regulated by second messengers, phosphorylation or protein/protein interactions. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase is an exception to this general rule, being controlled only at the level of expression. In K. fedtschenkoi, its expression is controlled both developmentally and by a circadian oscillator.
8499614	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA clone encoding ATP/ADP translocator.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA clone which encodes an open reading frame of 382 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to an ATP/ADP translocator protein. Its homology with a maize ATP/ADP translocator was 83.9% in nucleotide sequence, and 90.2% of the amino acid level. Expression of this gene is regulated by such external stresses as salinity and low temperature.
1376401	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants.	1992	Mol Gen Genet	Using probes obtained by PCR amplification, we have isolated two cognate rice cDNAs (cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2) encoding structural homologues of the cdc2+/CDC28 (cdc2) protein kinase from a cDNA library prepared from cultured rice cells. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2 showed that they are 83% identical. They are 62% identical to CDC28 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and much more similar to the yeast and mammalian p34cdc2 kinases than to rice R2, a cdc2-related kinase isolated previously by screening the same rice cDNA library with a different oligonucleotide probe. Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome. RNA blot analysis revealed that these genes are expressed in proliferating rice cells and in young rice seedlings. cdc2Os-1 could complement a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant of cdc28. However, despite the similarity in structure, both cdc2Os-2 and R2 were unable to complement the same mutant. Thus, the present results demonstrate the presence of structurally related, but functionally distinct cognates of the cdc2 cell cycle kinase in rice.
15111725	Functional analysis of a rice putative voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, OsTPC1, expressed in yeast cells lacking its homologous gene CCH1.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated a cDNA (OsTPC1) from rice that was homologous to AtTPC1, a putative voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. The hydropathy profile of its deduced amino acid sequence showed significant structural features of the alpha 1-subunit of animal VDCCs. Functional analysis using a heterologous yeast expression system showed that OsTPC1 facilitates Ca(2+) permeation. The K(m) value for Ca(2+) of OsTPC1, 47.5 micro M, was comparable to that of intrinsic CCH1, a candidate VDCC in yeast. Ca(2+) permeation by OsTPC1 was inhibited by verapamil, a VDCC blocker. These findings indicate for the first time that OsTPC1 is a putative VDCC in rice.
15169937	A novel rice PR10 protein, RSOsPR10, specifically induced in roots by biotic and abiotic stresses, possibly via the jasmonic acid signaling pathway.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant roots have important roles not only in absorption of water and nutrients, but also in stress tolerance such as desiccation, salt, and low temperature. We have investigated stress-response proteins from rice roots using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and found a rice protein, RO-292, which was induced specifically in roots when 2-week-old rice seedlings were subjected to salt and drought stress. The full-length RO-292 cDNA was cloned, and was determined to encode a protein of 160 amino acid residues (16.9 kDa, pI 4.74). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to known rice PR10 proteins, OsPR10a/PBZ1 and OsPR10b. RO-292 mRNA accumulated rapidly upon drought, NaCl, jasmonic acid and probenazole, but not by exposure to low temperature or by abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The RO-292 gene was also up-regulated by infection with rice blast fungus. Interestingly, induction was observed almost exclusively in roots, thus we named the gene RSOsPR10 (root specific rice PR10). The present results indicate that RSOsPR10 is a novel rice PR10 protein, which is rapidly induced in roots by salt, drought stresses and blast fungus infection possibly through activation of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, but not the abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway.
1995335	cDNA cloning of a novel cdc2+/CDC28-related protein kinase from rice.	1991	FEBS Lett	A cDNA clone, named R2, has been isolated by screening a rice cell cDNA library with a redundant oligonucleotide probe derived from the conserved ATP binding site of cdc2+/CDC28 protein kinases. The cDNA contained the entire coding sequence for a 424 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 47.6 kDa. The R2 mRNA, 2.1 kb in size, was expressed in both cultured rice cells and rice seedlings at similar levels. The predicted R2 protein has canonical motifs for ATP binding and catalysis, and is significantly homologous (up to 47%) to members of the cdc2+/CDC28 subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinase. The R2 protein is a novel member of the subfamily.
8193305	Sequence and functional analyses of the rice gene homologous to the maize Vp1.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	The homologous gene of the maize Vp1 gene was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa). Sequence analysis revealed that the rice Vp1 gene (Osvp1) encodes a protein of 728 amino acids and is interupted by 5 introns at positions identical to those of the maize gene. Osvp1 transcript was detected in developing embryo as early as 10 days after flowering and decreased toward maturity. Osvp1 transcript was also detected in dry as well as imbided mature embryos. The ability of Osvp1 gene product to activate a target gene was shown by transient expression experiments in rice suspension-cultured cell protoplasts using a reporter gene construct carrying the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fused to the promoter of OsEm gene, the rice homologue of the wheat Em gene.
7599651	Regulation of the Osem gene by abscisic acid and the transcriptional activator VP1: analysis of cis-acting promoter elements required for regulation by abscisic acid and VP1.	1995	Plant J	Osem, a rice gene homologous to the wheat Em gene, which encodes one of the late-embryogenesis abundant proteins was isolated. The gene was characterized with respect to control of transcription by abscisic acid (ABA) and the transcriptional activator VP1, which is involved in the ABA-regulated gene expression during late embryo-genesis. A fusion gene (Osem-GUS) consisting of the Osem promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA. The expression of Osem-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1. The Osem promoter has three ACGTG-containing sequences, motif A, motif B and motif A', which resemble the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) that was previously identified in the wheat Em and the rice Rab16. There is also a CATGCATG sequence, which is known as the Sph box and is shown to be essential for the regulation by VP1 of the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene C1. Focusing on these sequence elements, various mutant derivatives of the Osem promoter in the transient expression system were assayed. The analysis revealed that motif A functions not only as an ABRE but also as a sequence element required for the regulation by (OS)VP1.

10624015	BWMK1, a novel MAP kinase induced by fungal infection and mechanical wounding in rice.	1999	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by different environmental stresses has been previously observed in several dicot plant species. Here, we report the isolation of a novel MAP kinase in rice that is induced during infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea or upon mechanical wounding. The gene is designated as BWMK1 for blast- and wound-induced MAP kinase. The cDNA of BWMK1 was isolated from rice leaves challenged by the blast pathogen. Transcripts of the corresponding gene accumulated in rice leaves 4 h after blast inoculation and 30 min after mechanical wounding. This gene encodes a 506 amino acid protein that contains a new dual-phosphorylation activation motif TDY and about 150 unique amino acids on its C terminus. In-gel kinase activity and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that BWMK1 is a functional MAP kinase. These results show that BWMK1 is a new member of the plant MAP kinase family and may mediate both defense and wound signaling in rice.
12100484	Cloning and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L) telomerase reverse transcriptase, which reveals complex splicing patterns.	2002	Plant J	Plant chromosomes terminate in telomeres as in other eukaryotes. Telomeres are vital to genome stability and their malfunctioning is lethal. One of the core components of the telomere complex is telomerase. The enzyme activity depends on RNA (TER) and reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunits. We describe here the isolation, sequencing and characterization of the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit from the monocot plant Oryza sativa L. (OsTERT). A single copy of this gene is present in the rice genome. The protein predicted from the OsTERT sequence has all the signature motifs of the TERT family members. Our data indicate that rice telomerase activity is developmentally regulated and is high in in vitro tissue and cell culture. However, steady-state transcript levels of the TERT gene do not seem to correlate with enzyme activity. Northern and RT-PCR analyses of the OsTERT gene transcript profile show multiple differentially spliced transcripts in both telomerase-positive and telomerase-negative tissues. Based on quantitative analysis of these transcripts, we speculate that the overall balance between the quantities of particular alternatively spliced transcripts may determine whether the TERT protein(s) is active or not. The diversity of splicing variants detected suggests that, as recently discovered for mammalian TERT proteins, rice TERT protein variants may perform functions other than telomere maintenance.

15960616	Spontaneously occurring mutations in the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase gene cause different sensitivities to ultraviolet-B in rice.	2005	Plant J	Sensitivity to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation (280-320 nm) varies widely among rice cultivars. We previously indicated that UV-resistant rice cultivars are better able to repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) through photorepair than are UV-sensitive cultivars. In this paper, we report that UVB sensitivity in rice, in part, is the result of defective CPD photolyase alleles. Surjamkhi (indica) exhibited greater sensitivity to UVB radiation and was more deficient in CPD photorepair ability compared with UV-resistant Sasanishiki (japonica). The deficiency in CPD photorepair in Surjamkhi resulted from changes in two nucleotides at positions 377 and 888 in the photolyase gene, causing alterations of two deduced amino acids at positions 126 and 296 in the photolyase enzyme. A linkage analysis in populations derived from Surjamkhi and Sasanishiki showed that UVB sensitivity is a quantitative inherited trait and that the CPD photolyase locus is tightly linked with a quantitative trait locus that explains a major portion of the genetic variation for this trait. These results suggest that spontaneously occurring mutations in the CPD photolyase gene cause different degrees of sensitivity to UVB in rice, and that the resistance of rice to UVB radiation could be increased by increasing the photolyase function through conventional breeding or bioengineering.
8605302	Cloning and characterization of the rice CatA catalase gene, a homologue of the maize Cat3 gene.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated and sequenced a genomic clone (CatA) encoding CAT-A catalase, a homologue of the maize catalase isozyme 3 (CAT-3) from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The 5'-upstream non-coding region had very low similarity with the maize Cat3 gene and possible cis elements and sequence motifs in the maize Cat3 gene were not evident, except for TATA and CAAT motifs. Several sequence motifs found in the promoters of plant seed-specific genes were identified in the 5'-upstream non-coding region of the CatA gene. Northern blotting showed that the CatA gene is expressed at high levels in seeds during early development and also in young seedlings. Methyl viologen (paraquat) resulted in the 3-fold induction of the CatA gene in the leaves of young seedlings, whereas abscisic acid, wounding, salicylic acid, and hydrogen peroxide had no or only slight effects. The 1.9 kb 5'-upstream fragment (-1559 to +342) of the CatA gene was fused with the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and introduced by electroporation into protoplasts prepared from rice suspension-cultured cells, then the transient expression of the GUS gene was examined. Deletion analysis of this chimeric gene suggested that a weak silencer is located in the region between -1564 to -699. Abscisic acid (ABA) at a final concentration of 10(-6) M doubled GUS activity in protoplasts electroporated with the chimeric DNAs having 1.9 to 1.2 kb 5'-upstream regions. A sequence highly similar to the Sph box, a motif found in genes modulated by ABA, was found at -266 to -254. Deletion of this region however, did not eliminate the responsiveness to ABA. Expression of the chimeric gene in the protoplasts was not enhanced by stress such as low and high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, methyl viologen, salicylic acid, elicitor, and UV light. The chimeric CatA-GUS plasmid DNAs amplified in the methylation-positive strain, E. coli DH5alpha, showed GUS gene activities, whereas all the chimeric DNAs amplified in the methylation-deficient E. coli JM110 were completely inactive in the presence or absence of ABA in the culture medium. DNA methylation, especially of either one or both of the deoxyadenosines at the two GATC motifs (one in the first exon and the other in the first intron of the rice CatA gene), appeared to be responsible for the CatA promoter activity identified in the transient assay.
11169192	Nicotianamine synthase gene expression differs in barley and rice under Fe-deficient conditions.	2001	Plant J	Nicotianamine (NA) is an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), which are crucial components of the iron acquisition apparatus of graminaceous plants. In non-graminaceous plants, NA is thought to be an essential chelator for metal cation homeostasis. Thus NA plays a key role in Fe metabolism and homeostasis in all higher plants. Nicotianamine synthase (NAS, EC 2.5.1.43) catalyzes the trimerization of S-adenosylmethionine to form one molecule of NA. Barley, a plant that is resistant to Fe deficiency, secretes large amounts of MAs, whereas rice, a plant that is susceptible to Fe deficiency, secretes only small amounts. In this study we isolated a genomic fragment containing HvNAS1 from barley and three rice cDNA clones, osnas1, osnas2 and osnas3, from Fe-deficient rice roots. We also isolated a genomic fragment containing both OsNAS1 and OsNAS2. In contrast to barley, in which Fe deficiency induces the expression of NAS genes only in roots, Fe deficiency in rice induced NAS gene expression in both roots and chlorotic leaves. The amounts of endogenous NA in both the roots and leaves were higher than in barley. We introduced barley genomic DNA fragments containing HvNAS1 with either 9 or 2 kb of the 5'-flanking region into rice, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Fe deficiency induced HvNAS1 expression in both roots and leaves of the transgenic rice, as occurs with rice NAS genes. Barley and rice NAS genes are compared in a discussion of alteration of the NAS genes during adaptation to Fe deficiency.
3666457	A rice glutelin and a soybean glycinin have evolved from a common ancestral gene.	1987	Gene	A cDNA clone covering the entire coding region for a glutelin subunit precursor has been identified from a library of endosperm-developing rice cDNA clones using a mixed oligodeoxynucleotide probe, and then by immunoprecipitation of hybrid-selected translation product with an antiserum against the acidic polypeptides of the glutelin. Analysis of the cDNA insert revealed that rice glutelin is synthesized as precursor polypeptides which undergo post-translational processing to form the nonrandom polypeptide pairs, like glycinin precursors of soybean. By comparing the predicted protein sequence of this precursor from monocots with that of glycinin A1aB1b precursor from dicots, it was found that the overall 32% of the amino acid positions are identical in both proteins. Because regions which show identities are dispersed throughout both molecules, the similarity is not due to convergent evolution, but to divergence evolution from a common ancestral gene.

8704128	Isolation and characterization of two cDNA clones for mRNAs that are abundantly expressed in immature anthers of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The relationship between the length of anthers and the stage of development of microspores was examined in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hayayuki). Anthers of < or = 2 mm and 2.1-2.2 mm in length and those ready to dehiscence were determined to be at the uninucleate, binucleate and trinucleate microspore stage, respectively. Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized. YY1 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 95 amino acids. Eight cysteine residues with the potential to form disulfide bridges were present in the amino acid sequence. There was a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the putative protein, suggesting that the YY1 protein might be secreted. This cysteine motif and the hydrophobic N-terminus are conserved among products of several anther-specific genes or cDNAs isolated from various plant species. These proteins are thought to form a superfamily of proteins that are confined to anthers. The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle. YY2 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 389 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited substantial homology to that of chalcone synthase. Expression of YY2 mRNA was confined to the tapetal cells. The genes correspond to YY1 and YY2 cDNAs were shown to exist as single copies in the rice genome.
9701579	Identification of a functional homolog of the yeast copper homeostasis gene ATX1 from Arabidopsis.	1998	Plant Physiol	A cDNA clone encoding a homolog of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) gene Anti-oxidant 1 (ATX1) has been identified from Arabidopsis. This gene, referred to as Copper CHaperone (CCH), encodes a protein that is 36% identical to the amino acid sequence of ATX1 and has a 48-amino acid extension at the C-terminal end, which is absent from ATX1 homologs identified in animals. ATX1-deficient yeast (atx1) displayed a loss of high-affinity iron uptake. Expression of CCH in the atx1 strain restored high-affinity iron uptake, demonstrating that CCH is a functional homolog of ATX1. When overexpressed in yeast lacking the superoxide dismutase gene SOD1, both ATX1 and CCH protected the cell from the reactive oxygen toxicity that results from superoxide dismutase deficiency. CCH was unable to rescue the sod1 phenotype in the absence of copper, indicating that CCH function is copper dependent. In Arabidopsis CCH mRNA is present in the root, leaf, and inflorescence and is up-regulated 7-fold in leaves undergoing senescence. In plants treated with 800 nL/L ozone for 30 min, CCH mRNA levels increased by 30%. In excised leaves and whole plants treated with high levels of exogenous CuSO4, CCH mRNA levels decreased, indicating that CCH is regulated differently than characterized metallothionein proteins in Arabidopsis.
9718725	A single base change altered the regulation of the Waxy gene at the posttranscriptional level during the domestication of rice.	1998	Mol Biol Evol	The rice waxy (wx) locus has two functional alleles, Wxa and Wxb, which are defined by a large difference in the amount of the gene product, called Wx protein, that accumulates in mature seeds. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this difference and to identify the base change causing the alteration of the regulation of the Wx gene during rice evolution, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the regulatory region of Wx alleles and analyzed their function in a transient assay system using rice protoplasts. All Wxa alleles from Oryza sativa Indica, O. rufipogon, and O. glaberrima have a normal sequence of GT at the 5' splice junction of the first intron, representing a high expression level of the Wx transcripts in the endosperm and a high beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in protoplasts. On the other hand, Wxb alleles from two strains of O. sativa Japonica have TT at the 5' splice junction, representing a low expression level of the mature transcripts and a low GUS activity. Northern blot analysis also indicated that a larger transcript, consisting of the unspliced first intron, is closely correlated with the function of the Wxb allele. These results suggest that a single base change at the 5' splice junction causes inefficient splicing and, as a result, reduces the level of mature transcript and the GUS activity in the Wxb allele. The Wxb allele in O. saativa Japonica may have been differentiated from the Wxa allele of O. rufipogon, its wild progenitor, by this mutation, and, therefore, a single base change that has altered the regulation of the Wx gene at the posttranscriptional level probably occurred during the domestication of rice.
1376404	Retrotransposon families in rice.	1992	Mol Gen Genet	Three families of retrotransposons of rice (Tos1, Tos2, and Tos3) were isolated by using a method based on the sequence conservation of the primer binding site for reverse transcription. This method should be generally applicable for cloning retrotransposon of other plants. One retrotransposon, Tos3-1, was studied in detail. Tos3-1 is 5.2 kb long, has structures common to retrotransposons, such as long terminal repeats (LTR), a primer binding site complementary to the initiator tRNA, a polypurine tract, and generates target sequence duplications flanking the inserted element. Southern blotting analysis showed that sequences homologous to Tos1, 2 and 3 are found in wild rice species as well as in cultivated rice species, but not in maize and tobacco. The copy number and genomic location of the families vary in different strains of one species of wild rice, suggesting that these elements may still be active. Retrotransposons were also screened for by amplification of the reverse transcriptase coding region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At least two types of copia-like elements (Tos4 and Tos5) were found. The total copy number of retrotransposons in the rice genome was estimated to be about 1000. These results suggest that, as in Drosophila, retrotransposons are the major transposon class in rice.
8755553	Retrotransposons of rice involved in mutations induced by tissue culture.	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Five retrotransposon families of rice (Tos1-Tos5) have been reported previously. Here we report 15 new retrotransposon families of rice (Tos6-Tos20). In contrast to yeast and Drosophila retrotransposons, all of the rice retrotransposons examined appear inactive (or almost inactive) under normal growth conditions. Three of the rice retrotransposons (Tos10, Tos17, and Tos19) are activated under tissue culture conditions. The most active one, Tos17, was studied in detail. The copy number of Tos17 increased with prolonged culture period. In all of the plants regenerated from tissue cultures, including transgenic plants, 5 to 30 transposed Tos17 copies were detected. The transcript of Tos17 was only detected under tissue culture conditions, indicating that the transposition of Tos17 is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. To examine the target-site specificity of Tos17 transposition, sequences flanking transposed Tos17 copies were analyzed. At least four out of eight target sites examined are coding regions. Other target sites may also be in genes because two out of four were transcribed. The regenerated plants with Tos17-insertions in the phytochrome A gene and the S-receptor kinase-related gene were identified. These results indicate that activation of Tos17 is an important cause of tissue culture-induced mutations. Tissue culture-induced activation of Tos17 may be a useful tool for insertional mutagenesis and functional analysis of genes.
15849298	Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, OsENT2, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport.	2005	Plant Physiol	We identified four genes for potential equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) from rice (Oryza sativa; designated OsENT1 through OsENT4). Growth analysis of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells expressing OsENTs showed that OsENT2 transported adenosine and uridine with high affinity (adenosine, K(m) = 3.0 microm; uridine, K(m) = 0.7 microm). Purine or pyrimidine nucleosides and 2'-deoxynucleosides strongly inhibited adenosine transport via OsENT2, suggesting that OsENT2 possesses broad substrate specificity. OsENT2-mediated adenosine transport was resistant to the typical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, dilazep, and dipyridamole. The transport activity was maximal at pH 5.0 and decreased slightly at lower as well as higher pH. In competition experiments with various cytokinins, adenosine transport by OsENT2 was inhibited by isopentenyladenine riboside (iPR). Direct measurements with radiolabeled cytokinins demonstrated that OsENT2 mediated uptake of iPR (K(m) = 32 microm) and trans-zeatin riboside (K(m) = 660 microm), suggesting that OsENT2 participates in iPR transport in planta. In mature plants, OsENT2 was predominantly expressed in roots. The OsENT2 promoter drove the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene in the scutellum during germination and in vascular tissues in germinated plants, suggesting a participation of OsENT2 in the retrieval of endosperm-derived nucleosides by the germinating embryo and in the long-distance transport of nucleosides in growing plants, respectively.
9522469	cDNA cloning and tissue specific expression of a gene for sucrose transporter from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	We describe the cloning and expression analysis of a sucrose transporter cDNA from a monocot (the rice plant, Oryza sativa L.). The cDNA clone (OsSUT1) encoded an open reading frame of 1,611 bp (537 amino acids) and showed 76.8 to 79.7% similarity at the amino acid level to other sucrose transporters of dicot species. The predicted membrane topology of OsSUT1 protein is made up of 12 transmembrane helices which is consistent with most of the mono- and disaccharide transporters previously identified. When OsSUT1 cDNA was introduced into yeast and expressed, the cells rapidly accumulated sucrose demonstrating that OsSUT1 does, in fact, encode a sucrose transporter. From genomic Southern hybridization OsSUT1 appeared to be a single copy gene. OsSUT1 was expressed in source organs such as leaf blade, leaf sheath and germinating seed whereas little or no expression was observed in some sink organs such as the panicles before heading and the roots. Transcript was observed at high levels in panicles after heading, particularly in the portion containing endosperm and embryo. In addition, expression of OsSUT1 was high in etiolated seedlings and decreased during light-induced greening.
11978873	Cell wall invertase in developing rice caryopsis: molecular cloning of OsCIN1 and analysis of its expression in relation to its role in grain filling.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	To establish the significance of cell wall invertase in grain filling of rice (Oryza sativa L.), we cloned a cDNA for a cell wall invertase from developing grains of rice. The cDNA, designated OsCIN1, contains an open reading frame of 1731 bp encoding a polypeptide of 577 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence showed typical features of the cell wall invertases, including a beta-fructosidase motif and a cysteine catalytic site, and shared 78.6 and 73.7% identity with maize cell wall invertases, Incw1 and Incw2, respectively. OsCIN1 is expressed in roots, in sink- and source-leaves, and in panicles. During the course of grain filling in the caryopses, OsCIN1 transcript is detectable only in the very early stage of their development, 1-4 d after flowering, when the cell wall invertase activity is the highest and the increase in caryopsis length is rapid. In situ localization of the mRNA revealed that OsCIN1 is expressed preferentially in the vascular parenchyma of the dorsal vein, integument and its surrounding cells, and is expressed weakly in the nucellar projection and nucellar epidermis. These results suggest that, during the early stage of caryopsis development, OsCIN1 is important for supplying a carbon source to developing filial tissues by cleaving unloaded sucrose in the apoplast.
10631249	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice.	2000	Plant Physiol	In many plants, cysteine proteinases play essential roles in a variety of developmental and physiological processes. In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings. In the present study, the gene encoding REP-1 was isolated, characterized, and designated as OsEP3A. An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice. The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells. The OsEP3A promoter was linked to the coding sequence of the reporter gene, gusA, which encodes beta-glucuronidase (GUS), and the chimeric gene was introduced into the rice genome. The OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer nitrogen regulation of GUS expression in suspension-cultured cells. Histochemical studies also indicate that the OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer the hormonal regulation of GUS expression in germinating seeds. These studies demonstrate that in rice the REP-1 protease encoded by OsEP3A may play a role in various physiological responses and processes, and that multiple mechanisms regulate the expression of OsEP3A.
10611387	A bZIP factor, TRAB1, interacts with VP1 and mediates abscisic acid-induced transcription.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The transcription factor VP1 regulates maturation and dormancy in plant seeds by activating genes responsive to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Although activation involves ABA-responsive elements (ABREs), VP1 itself does not specifically bind ABREs. Instead, we have identified and cloned a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor, TRAB1, that interacts with both VP1 and ABREs. Transcription from a chimeric promoter with GAL4-binding sites was ABA-inducible if cells expressed a GAL4 DNA-binding domain::TRAB1 fusion protein. Results indicate that TRAB1 is a true trans-acting factor involved in ABA-regulated transcription and reveal a molecular mechanism for the VP1-dependent, ABA-inducible transcription that controls maturation and dormancy in plant embryos.
12445121	Loss-of-function of a rice brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzyme, C-6 oxidase, prevents the organized arrangement and polar elongation of cells in the leaves and stem.	2002	Plant J	Molecular genetic and physiological studies on brassinosteroid (BR)-related mutants of dicot plants have revealed that BRs play important roles in normal plant growth and development. However, little is known about the function of BR in monocots (grasses), except for the phenotypic analysis of a rice mutant partially insensitive to BR signaling. To investigate the function of BR in monocots, we identified and characterized BR-deficient mutants of rice, BR-deficient dwarf1 (brd1). The brd1 mutants showed a range of abnormalities in organ development and growth, the most striking of which were defects in the elongation of the stem and leaves. Light microscopic observations revealed that this abnormality was primarily owing to a failure in the organization and polar elongation of the leaf and stem cells. The accumulation profile of BR compounds in the brd1 mutants suggested that these plants may be deficient in the activity of BR C-6 oxidase. Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, OsDWARF, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF. Introduction of the wild-type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants. The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the biological function of BRs in rice plants.
11489190	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa.	2001	Plant J	It is thought that Na+ and K+ homeostasis is crucial for salt-tolerance in plants. To better understand the Na+ and K+ homeostasis in important crop rice (Oryza sativa L.), a cDNA homologous to the wheat HKT1 encoding K+-Na+ symporter was isolated from japonica rice, cv Nipponbare (Ni-OsHKT1). We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2). The predicted amino acid sequence of Ni-OsHKT1 shares 100% identity with Po-OsHKT1 and 91% identity with Po-OsHKT2, and they are 66-67% identical to wheat HKT1. Low-K+ conditions (less than 3 mM) induced the expression of all three OsHKT genes in roots, but mRNA accumulation was inhibited by the presence of 30 mM Na+. We further characterized the ion-transport properties of OsHKT1 and OsHKT2 using an expression system in the heterologous cells, yeast and Xenopus oocytes. OsHKT2 was capable of completely rescuing a K+-uptake deficiency mutation in yeast, whereas OsHKT1 was not under K+-limiting conditions. When OsHKTs were expressed in Na+-sensitive yeast, OsHKT1 rendered the cells more Na+-sensitive than did OsHKT2 in high NaCl conditions. The electrophysiological experiments for OsHKT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed that external Na+, but not K+, shifted the reversal potential toward depolarization. In contrast, for OsHKT2 either Na+ or K+ in the external solution shifted the reversal potential toward depolarization under the mixed Na+ and K+ containing solutions. These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice.
7991697	Sequence of a cDNA from Oryza sativa (L.) encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase 1 gene.	1994	Plant Physiol	
7846174	Nucleotide sequence of a rice genomic pyruvate decarboxylase gene that lacks introns: a pseudo-gene?	1994	Plant Physiol	
8806407	Characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase genes from rice.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The pdc1 gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase has been isolated and sequenced from an IR54 rice genomic library. In contrast to a previously isolated intron-less rice genomic pdc, pRgpdc3, this gene contains five intervening introns in the coding region and corresponds to a cDNA clone, pRcpdc1, isolated from an IR54-cDNA library constructed from anaerobically-induced mRNAs. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this gene with that of the rice pdc2 and pdc3 showed 88% and 89% similarity, and 78% and 79% identity, respectively. Southern blots indicated that more than three genes constitute the pdc gene family in rice. pdc1 is highly inducible under anaerobic conditions. Rice pdc2 is also inducible by anoxia but to a much lesser extent than pdc1.
9630507	Molecular analysis of a novel protein kinase in maturing rice seed.	1998	Gene	Protein kinases play important roles in controlling biological functions. We employed PCR-based cloning technique to isolate a protein kinase gene from rice endosperm and obtained a novel protein kinase (REK) cDNA clone from a cDNA library constructed from maturing rice seed. The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA exhibited a high similarity to the wheat abscisic acid inducible protein kinase (PKABA1), including 11 conserved regions of the catalytic domain. REK belongs to the SNF1-related family that possesses abundant acidic amino acid resides in the C-terminal region. RT-PCR analysis showed that the REK gene is expressed in leaf and maturing seed, but not in stem and root. Bacterial recombinant REK showed autophosphorylation activity depending upon Ca2+. In addition, we isolated a REK genomic clone and determined its gene structure.
15684019	Phylogenetic analyses identify 10 classes of the protein disulfide isomerase family in plants, including single-domain protein disulfide isomerase-related proteins.	2005	Plant Physiol	Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) are molecular chaperones that contain thioredoxin (TRX) domains and aid in the formation of proper disulfide bonds during protein folding. To identify plant PDI-like (PDIL) proteins, a genome-wide search of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was carried out to produce a comprehensive list of 104 genes encoding proteins with TRX domains. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted for these sequences using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. The resulting phylogenetic tree showed that evolutionary relationships of TRX domains alone were correlated with conserved enzymatic activities. From this tree, we identified a set of 22 PDIL proteins that constitute a well-supported clade containing orthologs of known PDIs. Using the Arabidopsis PDIL sequences in iterative BLAST searches of public and proprietary sequence databases, we further identified orthologous sets of 19 PDIL sequences in rice (Oryza sativa) and 22 PDIL sequences in maize (Zea mays), and resolved the PDIL phylogeny into 10 groups. Five groups (I-V) had two TRX domains and showed structural similarities to the PDIL proteins in other higher eukaryotes. The remaining five groups had a single TRX domain. Two of these (quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase-like and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase-like) had putative nonisomerase enzymatic activities encoded by an additional domain. Two others (VI and VIII) resembled small single-domain PDIs from Giardia lamblia, a basal eukaryote, and from yeast. Mining of maize expressed sequence tag and RNA-profiling databases indicated that members of all of the single-domain PDIL groups were expressed throughout the plant. The group VI maize PDIL ZmPDIL5-1 accumulated during endoplasmic reticulum stress but was not found within the intracellular membrane fractions and may represent a new member of the molecular chaperone complement in the cell.
9773271	Promoter structure and activity of type 1 rice metallothionein-like gene.	1998	DNA Seq	A novel stress-inducible metallothionein-like gene from rice, designated as rgMT-1 (rice genomic metallothionein-like gene-1), was isolated and sequenced. From the sequence analysis of its 5'-flanking region, two putative TATA boxes, one CAAT box, and several short sequences homologous to regulatory cis-elements previously reported were identified. Two direct repeats, one 10 bp in length (CAAAATCAAA) and the other 11 bp (GTGAAAATACT), respectively, were also found. By transient GUS (beta-glucuronidase) assay, the expression of GUS, in vitro, was enhanced by the presence of the rgMT-1 intron. The critical region which controls the basal transcription was shown to lie between -73 and -36 upstream of rgMT-1, in which one of the two putative TATA boxes was located. The promoter activity was lost completely when both putative TATA boxes were deleted. This is the first report describing the genomic structure and regulation of a monocotyledonous metallothionein-like gene critical to the response of stress.
7632910	A novel stress-inducible metallothionein-like gene from rice.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	A novel rice genomic sequence encoding coding segments homologous to other metallothionein-like genes was isolated from Oryza sativa genomic library. This sequence, hereby designated as rgMT (rice genomic metallothionein-like gene), consists of two exons and one intron. From the coding sequence, it is predicted that rgMT encodes one protein of 74 amino acids. Differential expression of rgMT in rice plants was observed as mature transcripts were more abundant in roots than in leaves and sheaths. Under different stress conditions, such as excess heavy metals and heat shock, expression of rgMT was significantly elevated. This was especially noticeable with 250 microM CuCl2 for 16 h, 40 degrees C heat for 2 h and 0.06% DMSO for 1 h. Under sucrose starvation, rgMT transcripts also increased with time up to 72 h. During recovery from sucrose starvation, the transcripts declined slightly within 12 h of recovery. rgMT transcripts were also seen to have increased expression in senescent leaves. These results support the notion that rgMT is a stress-inducible gene in rice heretofore unreported.
8980501	RNA expression patterns of a type 2 metallothionein-like gene from rice.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	A type 2 metallothionein-like gene from rice, OsMT-2 (Oryza sativa metallothionein-like gene-2), was isolated in its cDNA form and sequenced. By northern analyses OsMT-2 expression was shown to be induced under stress by sucrose starvation, heat shock and, to a lesser extent, abscisic acid, but not excess metals, including copper. Its response to sucrose starvation was transient and different from OsMT-1, a type 1 metallothionein-like gene of rice inducible by copper. These results suggest that while OsMT-2 is also involved in cellular response to stress, its function may be complementary to that of OsMT-1.
8849907	Isolation and characterization of rice R genes: evidence for distinct evolutionary paths in rice and maize.	1996	Genetics	R and B genes and their homologues encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activators that regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in flowering plants. In maize, R/B genes comprise a very small gene family whose organization reflects the unique evolutionary history and genome architecture of maize. To know whether the organization of the R gene family could provide information about the origins of the distantly related grass rice, we characterized members of the R gene family from rice Oryza saliva. Despite being a true diploid, O. sativa has at least two R genes. An active homologue (Ra) with extensive homology with other R genes is located at a position on chromosome 4 previously shown to be in synteny with regions of maize chromosomes 2 and 10 that contain the B and R loci, respectively. A second rice R gene (Rb) of undetermined function was identified on chromosome 1 and found to be present only in rice species with AA genomes. All non-AA species have but one R gene that is Ra-like. These data suggest that the common ancestor shared by maize and rice had a single R gene and that the small R gene families of grasses have arisen recently and independently.
12645266	[In silico cloning of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA from rice (Oryza sativa L.)].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	In silico cloning was a new strategy of gene cloning developed with the development of genome, EST projects and bioinformatics. Using wheat glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (clone: Tagpdl) sequence as a querying probe, one highly homologous BAC clone sequence was obtained from rice sequence database of GenBank and the putative cDNA sequence of rice glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assembled according to the wheat clone. Furthermore, the full-length cDNA of rice glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was cloned by RT-PCR with two primers designed based on this assembled cDNA sequence. Since this fragment contained a complete ORF of 1515 bp with a stop codon in its upstream and poly(A) signal in its downstream, it could be concluded that a full-length gene (GenBank accession number AY078072), which was named as OsG6PDH. Homology analysis of OsG6PDH showed a 88% identity with wheat and the deduced amino acid showed 89%, 79% and 80% homology with G6PDH from wheat, tomato and tobacco respectively. OsG6PDH was expressed in inflorescence, embryo, root and leaf of rice, with a slightly higher in inflorescence and root. It was also discussed in this paper that the application of in silico cloning in the isolation of functional genes from rice.
14672408	Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress.	2003	Mol Biol Rep	The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is the important metabolism pathway in plant. In the present study, a cDNA encoding one of the key enzymes of PPP, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase(6PGDH), was isolated from rice and designated as Os6PGDH. The Os6PGDH encoding protein is a cytosolic isoenzyme according to the absence of plastid transit peptide at the N-terminus. The full-length cDNA of 1751 bp encodes 480 amino acids and its putative protein sequence is 94%, 84% and 83% identical to maize, spinach and alfalfa 6PGDHs respectively. Comparison of the cloned mRNA sequence with that of the genomic sequence from the Rice Genome Project showed a simple genomic organization devoid of introns in the translated region of the gene. RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves. Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress. It is suggested that 6PGDH in plant may play an important role in cell division and salt response.
15354353	Isolation and characterization of two cDNAs encoding translation initiation factor 1A from rice(Oryza sativa L.).	2004	DNA Seq	The eukaryotic initiation factor 1A(eIF1A) is essential for transferring of the initiator Met-tRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits to form the 40S pre-initiation complex. In present study, we describe the cloning and characterization of two eIF1A genes from rice, which were designated as Oryza sativa eukaryotic initiation factor 1A genes OseIF1A-1, OseIF1A-2, respectively. Both rice elF1As shared high identities in amino acids with eIF1A proteins from other eukaryotes. The mRNA expression analysis revealed that OseIF1A-2 mRNA was much more accumulated than OseIF1A-1 in all tissues but each gene is expressed in root, stem, leaf and flowering spike in high and nearly equal level, and in immature spike in lower level. These results, together with their different location in unrooted phylogenetic tree inferred from amino acid sequences of all known eIF1As, suggested that there are two types of eIF1A genes with different function or different regulation in rice.
16172918	Rice ZFP15 gene encoding for a novel C2H2-type zinc finger protein lacking DLN box, is regulated by spike development but not by abiotic stresses.	2005	Mol Biol Rep	A novel C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene, ZFP 15, was cloned from rice by RT-PCR approach. The ZFP 15 gene encodes a protein of 144 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 15 kDa. The ZFP 15 protein comprises two C2H2-type zinc finger domains, a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its N-terminus but the DLN-box identified in all reported plant C2H2-type zinc finger proteins was not found. A homology search revealed that ZFP 15 gene was localized within a cluster of C2H2-type zinc finger genes in BAC clone OJ1754_E06 mapped on chromosome 3. All three members in the cluster encoded proteins showed high identities in amino acids and might contribute to a co-regulation. The RT-PCR assay revealed that ZFP 15 mRNA was not regulated by cold, salt, drought and ABA stresses, though CRT/DRE and ABRE elements were found in the promoter region of ZFP 15 gene. The expression profiling also showed that ZFP 15 mRNA was expressed with a lower level in leaves and roots, but not detected in stems. Besides, ZFP15 was shown to accumulate much more in flowering spike than in immature spike. Thus, ZFP15, as the first characterized C2H2-type zinc finger protein in rice, might play a regulatory role on rice spike development.

9063969	Complete structures of three rice sucrose synthase isogenes and differential regulation of their expressions.	1996	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	By cloning and sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA and transcription initiation site mapping, the total structures including at least 1 kb of putative regulatory sequences upstream of the transcription initiation sites of three genes encoding rice sucrose synthase isoprotomers were either newly established or amended. The third type of SS gene, RSus3, has not been found in other plants. The structures of the three genes and the gene products were compared and their evolutionary sequence was proposed. Specific probes for the three SS mRNA's were developed and used for analyzing their steady state levels at different organs and under some physiological stress conditions. It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3. A possible cause of the presence of the third rice SS gene was discussed. We also reported a novel method to synthesize single-stranded DNA for S1 mapping of a transcription initiation site associated with extended secondary structures.
2263460	Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes.	1990	Nucleic Acids Res	Rice alpha-amylases are encoded by a multigene family that has previously been classified into 5 hybridization groups. DNA sequence and Southern blot analysis identified three genes (RAmy1A, RAmy1B and RAmy1C) in Group 1 with DNA sequence identity of at least 90%. Hybridization Group 2 is represented by only one gene, RAmy3D, which is identical to a previously characterized cDNA, pOS137. RAmy3D is physically linked to the sole representative of Group 5, RAmy3E. The identity between these two genes is 81.4% in the coding region but less than 50% in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. Northern blot analysis and RNA-PCR were used to detect the expression of alpha-amylase genes in various tissues. Alpha-amylase mRNA was abundant in germinating seeds and callus. Some genes were also expressed at much lower levels in roots, young leaves and immature seeds. RAmy1A and RAmy3E were expressed in all tissues while RAmy3D was expressed in all tissues except the immature seeds. RAmy1B was weakly expressed only in callus. RAmy1A transcript was most abundant in the germinating seeds, while RAmy3D and RAmy3E transcripts were most abundant in callus and immature seeds, respectively.
2102847	Classification and characterization of the rice alpha-amylase multigene family.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	To establish the size and organization of the rice alpha-amylase multigene family, we have isolated 30 alpha-amylase clones from three independent genomic libraries. Partial characterization of these clones indicates that they fall into 5 hybridization groups containing a total of 10 genes. Two clones belonging to the Group 3 hybridization class have more than one gene per cloned fragment. The nucleotide sequence of one clone from Group 1, lambda OSg2, was determined and compared to other known cereal alpha-amylase sequences revealing that lambda OSg2 is the genomic analog of the rice cDNA clone, pOS103. The rice alpha-amylase genes in Group 1 are analogous to the alpha-Amy1 genes in barley and wheat. lambda OSg2 contains sequence motifs common to most actively transcribed genes in plants. Two consensus sequences, TAACAAGA and TATCCAT, were found in the 5' flanking regions of alpha-amylase genes of rice, barley and wheat. The former sequence may be specific to alpha-amylase gene while the latter sequence may be related to a 'CATC' box found in many plant genes. Another sequence called the pyrimidine box (TCCTTTTTC) was found in the alpha-amylase genes as well as other genes regulated by gibberellic acid (GA). Comparisons based on amino acid sequence alignment revealed that the multigene families in rice, barley and wheat shared a common ancestor which contained three introns. Some of the descendants of the progenitor alpha-amylase gene appear to have lost the middle intron while others maintain all three introns.
10691130	Isolation and mapping of rFUS6, a rice orthologue of Arabidopsis thaliana FUS6.	1999	DNA Res	COP9 complex is one of the most important components that act in repressing photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. FUS6 has been identified as one of eight subunits of the COP9 complex in Arabidopsis. Using Arabidopsis Fus6 cDNA as a probe, we screened a rice root cDNA library and a rice genomic library. A 1730-bp cDNA was obtained, which has an open reading frame corresponding to 441-amino-acid. This 441 amino acids putative protein has 67% identity with Arabidopsis COP11/FUS6 (AtFUS6) and 40% identity with human GPS1, an AtFUS6 orthologue. So we designated this novel gene as rFUS6. The 6.2-kb genomic sequence of rFUS6 was also obtained. Sequence comparison showed that the rFUS6 gene had six exons and five introns. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of some potential light-regulated cis-elements such as a G-box, GT-1 binding sites, and a TGACG motif. Southern hybridization with rice total DNA showed that rFUS6 was perhaps a single copy gene. The rFUS6 locus was mapped by hybridization with a rice BAC library membrane and the results showed that rFUS6 had a locus at 16.3 cM of chromosome 1.
10480383	An anaerobically inducible early (aie) gene family from rice.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	One of the major abiotic stresses that affect plant growth and development is anoxia or hypoxia. Plants respond to anoxia by regulation of gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Genes involved in such regulation are expected to be expressed soon after onset of anoxia. To date, however, anaerobically regulated genes that have been characterized predominantly encode enzymes for sugar phosphate metabolism, and are induced after several hours of anaerobic conditions. Early induced genes, those responding after 1-2 h of anoxia, have not been studied extensively. To study the early anaerobic response we investigated the most flooding-tolerant variety of rice, FR13A (flood-resistant). We used differential display techniques to identify cDNA fragments representing mRNAs that are induced within 90 min of anoxia. We isolated two cDNA fragments and one full-length cDNA that were induced to high levels. These cDNAs were found to be members of a family of 2-3 genes, which were called the aie (anaerobically inducible early) gene family. Northern blot analyses showed that the mRNA levels of aie genes peaked after 1.5 to 3 h of anoxia and were still at high levels after 72 h of anoxia. RNase protection assays showed 4-5 different protected bands indicating multiple transcripts from the aie gene family. Sequence analyses of the full-length cDNA showed an open reading frame that putatively encodes a 14 kDa protein of 127 amino acid residues. Neither the nucleotide nor the deduced amino acid sequences of this gene showed any significant homology to any known genes or proteins present in the GenBank or SwissProt databases. This novel gene, that is induced so early under anoxia in plants, may play an important role in plant metabolism under anaerobic conditions.

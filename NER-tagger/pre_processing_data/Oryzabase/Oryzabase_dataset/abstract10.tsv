11310740	A novel jasmonic acid-inducible rice myb gene associates with fungal infection and host cell death.	2001	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Endogenous signal molecules such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play an important role in induced resistance against pathogen infection and insect herbivory. In rice seedlings, JA is an effective inducer of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against infection of blast fungus (Pyricularia grisea). To gain further insights into JA-mediated defense signaling pathways, we isolated and characterized a pathogen- and JA-induced rice gene (JAmyb) that encodes a Myb transcription factor. The JAmyb gene was induced within 1 day after fungal infection in resistant and susceptible interactions prior to lesion formation. Unlike most defense-related genes that are activated faster and stronger in resistant interactions, JAmyb induction by blast fungus is much higher in susceptible interactions, accompanied by large lesions and extensive tissue damage. Significant induction of JAmyb also was observed during cell death and lesion formation in certain lesion mimic mutants. Interestingly, JAmyb was activated rapidly by JA or wounding, independent of de novo protein synthesis, but not by other endogenous signal molecules such as SA and abscisic acid or SAR inducers such as benzothiadiazole and probenazole. We used SA-deficient transgenic plants to further demonstrate that depletion of SA in rice did not abolish but rather enhanced blast-induced JAmyb expression. These results suggest that JAmyb is related closely to host cell death and is involved in the JA-mediated, SA-independent signaling pathways in rice.
11432928	Leaf senescence in rice plants: cloning and characterization of senescence up-regulated genes.	2001	J Exp Bot	To identify senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in rice leaves, senescence was induced by transferring rice seedlings into darkness. Senescence up-regulated cDNAs were obtained by PCR-based subtractive hybridization. Among 14 SAG clones characterized, 11 were found to be associated with both dark-induced and natural leaf senescence. Three clones were associated only with dark-induced leaf senescence. The possible physiological roles of these SAGs during rice leaf senescence are discussed.
15604681	A novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase gene is involved in rice leaf senescence.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	We previously isolated and identified numerous senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in rice leaves. Here we characterized the structure and function of an SAG- Osh69 encoding alkaline alpha-galactosidase that belongs to a novel family of glycosyl hydrolases. Osh69 is a single-copy gene composed of 13 exons located on rice chromosome 8. The expression level of Osh69 is not only up-regulated during natural leaf senescence but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones (methyl jasmonic acid, salicylic acid), and stresses (H2O2 and wounding). The recombinant Osh69 protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli has displayed optimal alpha-galactosidase activity at pH 8.0. The enzyme showed good hydrolytic activities towards alpha-1,6-galactosyl oligosaccharides and galactolipid digalactosyl diacylglycerol. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that Osh69 is specifically localized in the chloroplasts of senescing leaves. These findings strongly suggest an important role for Osh69 in the degradation of chloroplast galactolipids during leaf senescence.
14701936	Systematic reverse genetic screening of T-DNA tagged genes in rice for functional genomic analyses: MADS-box genes as a test case.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	We have generated 47 DNA pools and 235 subpools from 21,049 T-DNA insertion lines of rice. DNA pools of 500-1,000 lines were adequate for screening a T-DNA insertion within a 2-kb region. To examine the efficacy of the DNA pools, we selected MADS-box genes, which play an important role in controlling various aspects of plant development. A total of 34 MIKC-type MADS-box genes have now been identified from rice sequence databases. Our PCR screening for T-DNA insertions within 12 MADS-box genes resulted in the identification of five insertions in four different genes. These DNA pools will be valuable when isolating T-DNA insertional mutants in various rice genes. The DNA pool screening service and the mutant seeds are available upon request to genean@postech.ac.kr.
11598238	Expression of beta-expansins is correlated with internodal elongation in deepwater rice.	2001	Plant Physiol	Fourteen putative rice (Oryza sativa) beta-expansin genes, Os-EXPB1 through Os-EXPB14, were identified in the expressed sequence tag and genomic databases. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences are highly conserved in all 14 beta-expansins. They have a series of conserved C (cysteine) residues in the N-terminal half of the protein, an HFD (histidine-phenylalanine-aspartate) motif in the central region, and a series of W (tryptophan) residues near the carboxyl terminus. Five beta-expansin genes are expressed in deepwater rice internodes, with especially high transcript levels in the growing region. Expression of four beta-expansin genes in the internode was induced by treatment with gibberellin and by wounding. The wound response resulted from excising stem sections or from piercing pinholes into the stem of intact plants. The level of wound-induced beta-expansin transcripts declined rapidly 5 h after cutting of stem sections. We conclude that the expression of beta-expansin genes is correlated with rapid elongation of deepwater rice internodes, it is induced by gibberellin and wounding, and wound-induced beta-expansin mRNA appears to turn over rapidly.
12428004	Expression of alpha-expansin and expansin-like genes in deepwater rice.	2002	Plant Physiol	Previously, we have studied the expression and regulation of four alpha- and 14 beta-expansin genes in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa). We now report on the structure, expression, and regulation of 22 additional alpha-expansin (Os-EXP) genes, four expansin-like (Os-EXPL) genes, and one expansin-related (Os-EXPR) gene, which have recently been identified in the expressed sequence tag and genomic databases of rice. Alpha-expansins are characterized by a series of conserved Cys residues in the N-terminal half of the protein, a histidine-phenylalanine-aspartate (HFD) motif in the central region, and a series of tryptophan residues near the carboxyl terminus. Of the 22 additional alpha-expansin genes, five are expressed in internodes and leaves, three in coleoptiles, and nine in roots, with high transcript levels in the growing regions of these organs. Transcripts of five alpha-expansin genes were found in roots only. Expression of five alpha-expansin genes was induced in the internode by treatment with gibberellin (GA) and by wounding. The wound response resulted from excising stem sections or from piercing pinholes into the stem of intact plants. EXPL proteins lack the HFD motif and have two additional Cys residues in their C- and N-terminal regions. The positions of conserved tryptophan residues at the C-terminal region are different from those of alpha- and beta-expansins. Expression of the Os-EXPL3 gene is correlated with elongation and slightly induced by applied GA. However, the expression of the Os-EXPL1 and Os-EXPL2 genes showed limited correlation with cell elongation and was not induced by GA. We found no expression of the Os-EXPR1 gene in the organs examined.
11641069	Expansins: ever-expanding numbers and functions.	2001	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Expansins were first identified as cell-wall-loosening proteins that, at least in part, mediate pH-dependent extension of the plant cell wall and growth of the cell. More recently, it has been realized that expansins belong to two protein families, the alpha-and beta-expansins, and that they appear to be involved in regulating, besides cell expansion, a variety of plant processes, including morphogenesis, softening of fruits, and growth of the pollen tube of grasses through the stigma and the style. The Arabidopsis genome contains 26 alpha-expansin genes and the rice genome at least 26. There are more beta-expansin genes in monocots than in dicots, at least 14 in rice and five in Arabidopsis. Expansin genes are differentially regulated by environmental and hormonal signals, and hormonal regulatory elements have been found in their promoter regions. An analysis of exon/intron structure led to the hypothesis that alpha-and beta-expansins evolved from a common ancestral gene.
10898978	Identification of a phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein in higher plants.	2000	Curr Biol	The phragmoplast executes cytokinesis in higher plants. The major components of the phragmoplast are microtubules, which are arranged in two mirror-image arrays perpendicular to the division plane [1]. The plus ends of these microtubules are located near the site of the future cell plate. Golgi-derived vesicles are transported along microtubules towards the plus ends to deliver materials bound for the cell plate [2] [3]. During cell division, rapid microtubule reorganization in the phragmoplast requires the orchestrated activities of microtubule motor proteins such as kinesins. We isolated an Arabidopsis cDNA clone of a gene encoding an amino-terminal motor kinesin, AtPAKRP1, and have determined the partial sequence of its rice homolog. Immunofluorescence experiments with two sets of specific antibodies revealed consistent localization of AtPAKRP1 and its homolog in Arabidopsis and rice cells undergoing anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis. AtPAKRP1 started to accumulate along microtubules towards the spindle midzone during late anaphase. Once the phragmoplast microtubule array was established, AtPAKRP1 conspicuously localized to microtubules near the future cell plate. Our results provide evidence that AtPAKRP1 is a hitherto unknown motor that may take part in the establishment and/or maintenance of the phragmoplast microtubule array.
1716496	A novel glycine-rich cell wall protein gene in rice.	1991	Plant Mol Biol	A genomic clone isolated from rice (Oryza sativa var. IR 36) contains a gene that encodes a glycine-rich cell wall protein. This gene is a member of a multi-gene family. Two transcripts with different 5' termini are encoded by this gene and the expression of these two transcripts is differentially regulated. The amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence of this gene has a putative amino terminal signal peptide, and a highly repetitive structure in the putative mature protein. A model is proposed which describes the potential monomeric structure of this glycine-rich protein and how these monomers may be covalently linked to produce a network-like structure.
9419382	Rapid reorganization of resistance gene homologues in cereal genomes.	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We used conserved domains in the major class (nucleotide binding site plus leucine-rich repeat) of dicot resistance (R) genes to isolate related gene fragments via PCR from the monocot species rice and barley. Peptide sequence comparison of dicot R genes and monocot R-like genes revealed shared motifs but provided no evidence for a monocot-specific signature. Mapping of these genes in rice and barley showed linkage to genetically characterized R genes and revealed the existence of mixed clusters, each harboring at least two highly dissimilar R-like genes. Diversity was detected intraspecifically with wide variation in copy number between varieties of a particular species. Interspecific analyses of R-like genes frequently revealed nonsyntenic map locations between the cereal species rice, barley, and foxtail millet although tight collinear gene order is a hallmark of monocot genomes. Our data suggest a dramatic rearrangement of R gene loci between related species and implies a different mechanism for nucleotide binding site plus leucine-rich repeat gene evolution compared with the rest of the monocot genome.
15604706	A genetic and structural analysis of the N-glycosylation capabilities.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	The recent draft sequencing of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome has enabled a genetic analysis of the glycosylation capabilities of an agroeconomically important group of plants, the monocotyledons. In this study, we have not only identified genes putatively encoding enzymes involved in N-glycosylation, but have examined by MALDI-TOF MS the structures of the N-glycans of rice and other monocotyledons (maize, wheat and dates; Zea mays, Triticum aestivum and Phoenix dactylifera); these data show that within the plant kingdom the types of N-glycans found are very similar between monocotyledons, dicotyledons and gymnosperms. Subsequently, we constructed expression vectors for the key enzymes forming plant-typical structures in rice, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI; EC 2.4.1.101), core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucTA; EC 2.4.1.214) and beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.38) and successfully expressed them in Pichia pastoris. Rice GlcNAc-TI, FucTA and xylosyltransferase are therefore the first monocotyledon glycosyltransferases involved in N-glycan biosynthesis to be characterised in a recombinant form.
10725557	Molecular cloning of a novel water channel from rice: its products expression in Xenopus oocytes and involvement in chilling tolerance.	2000	Plant Sci	Water channel proteins, aquaporins, play a fundamental role in transmembrane water movements in plants. We isolated rice cDNA, rwc1, by screening a rice (Oryza sativa cv. Josaeng Tongil) cDNA library using a conserved motif of aquaporins. Like other aquaporin genes, rwc1 encodes a 290-residue protein with six putative transmembrane domains. The derived amino acid sequence of RWC1 shows high homology with PIP1 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1) subfamily members, which suggest it is localized in the plasma membrane. Injection of its cRNA into Xenopus oocytes increased the osmotic water permeability of the oocytes 2-3 times. Northern analysis showed that rice aquaporin genes are expressed in rice seedling leaves and roots, but that it disappeared from the root 6 h after osmotic stress began and that the transcript level remained low for about 24 h, then recovered. The time course of rice aquaporin gene-expression under osmotic stress was correlated with time course of turgor transition in plant. On the other hand, the levels of rice aquaporin gene-transcripts in leaves under chilling and recovery temperature depend on the pretreatment of mannitol for short time. This variation of the transcripts shown that rice aquaporin genes may play an important role in response to water stress-induced chilling tolerance.
10978528	Molecular cloning and expression of a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase homolog in Oryza sativa.	2000	Biochim Biophys Acta	A cDNA encoding putative phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX) was isolated from rice using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This cDNA, designated ricPHGPX, includes an open reading frame encoding a protein of 169 amino acids which shares about 60% and 50% amino acid sequence identity with plant and mammalian PHGPXs, respectively. The gene is expressed at a relative high level in flag leaves and the expression can be markedly induced by oxidative stress, suggesting that the product of the gene plays a key role in defense against oxidative damage in rice.
12687001	Control of tillering in rice.	2003	Nature	Tillering in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important agronomic trait for grain production, and also a model system for the study of branching in monocotyledonous plants. Rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that is formed on the unelongated basal internode and grows independently of the mother stem (culm) by means of its own adventitious roots. Rice tillering occurs in a two-stage process: the formation of an axillary bud at each leaf axil and its subsequent outgrowth. Although the morphology and histology and some mutants of rice tillering have been well described, the molecular mechanism of rice tillering remains to be elucidated. Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering. The moc1 mutant plants have only a main culm without any tillers owing to a defect in the formation of tiller buds. MOC1 encodes a putative GRAS family nuclear protein that is expressed mainly in the axillary buds and functions to initiate axillary buds and to promote their outgrowth.
10831839	Molecular and cellular characterizations of a cDNA clone encoding a novel isozyme of aldehyde dehydrogenase from rice.	2000	Gene	Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a group of enzymes catalyzing the conversion of aldehydes to the corresponding acids. In mammals and yeasts, at least two isozymes of ALDH are known to be involved in ethanol metabolism (cytosolic ALDH1 and mitochondrial ALDH2). Although mitochondrial ALDH isozymes have previously been identified in several plants, such as maize and tobacco, it is unclear whether cytosolic ALDH isozymes also exist in plants. In this study, we identified and characterized a cDNA clone encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1a) from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The open reading frame of this clone did not contain a typical mitochondrial targeting signal. Analysis of the subcellular localization of ALDH1a using green fluorescent protein (GFP) suggested that ALDH1a is a cytosolic enzyme rather than a mitochondrial enzyme. A genomic Southern hybridization indicated that sequences homologous to the ALDH1a gene are present in at least two regions of the rice genome. Amplification by RT-PCR showed that ALDH1a is expressed strongly in roots, but not in leaves, of rice seedlings, suggesting that ALDH1a functions in roots.
12953108	BRITTLE CULM1, which encodes a COBRA-like protein, affects the mechanical properties of rice plants.	2003	Plant Cell	Plant mechanical strength is an important agronomic trait. To understand the molecular mechanism that controls the plant mechanical strength of crops, we characterized the classic rice mutant brittle culm1 (bc1) and isolated BC1 using a map-based cloning approach. BC1, which encodes a COBRA-like protein, is expressed mainly in developing sclerenchyma cells and in vascular bundles of rice. In these types of cells, mutations in BC1 cause not only a reduction in cell wall thickness and cellulose content but also an increase in lignin level, suggesting that BC1, a gene that controls the mechanical strength of monocots, plays an important role in the biosynthesis of the cell walls of mechanical tissues.
10651810	Molecular cloning and characterization of calreticulin, a calcium-binding protein involved in the regeneration of rice cultured suspension cells.	2000	Eur J Biochem	A full-length cDNA clone encoding a phosphoprotein (pp56) involved in the regeneration of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-cultured suspension cells was isolated by screening a rice cultured suspension cell cDNA library. The 1558-bp cDNA sequence contains an ORF encoding an acidic (pI 4.38) protein of 424 amino acids (47.9 kDa), sharing 70-93% and 50-53% homology with other plant and mammalian calreticulins, respectively. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone revealed several significant conserved motifs, including a calreticulin family repeat motif in the central domain and two calreticulin family motifs in the N-domain, indicating that this gene is a rice calreticulin (CRO1). The CRO1 gene in long-term rice cultured suspension cells shows constitutive expression in both suspension culture and regeneration media. In contrast, expression of the CRO1 gene in short-term rice cultured suspension cells, which possess regeneration potential, is increased dramatically when these cells are transferred to the regeneration medium. After approximately 2 weeks in the regeneration medium, the expression of the CRO1 gene reverts to constitutive levels. These results demonstrate the presence of calreticulin in rice cultured suspension cells and its developmental regulation during the regeneration of rice cultured suspension cells.
10791831	Identification and chromosomal localization of a transcriptionally active retrotransposon of Ty3-gypsy type in rice.	2000	Genome	A DNA fragment representing a transcriptionally active retrotransposon of Ty3-gypsy type was isolated and characterized from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The fragment (named RIRE9) includes the coding sequences for the C-terminal part of the RNase H domain and the N-terminal part of the integrase domain in the polyprotein region. Northern blot hybridization indicated that this element was expressed in rice leaves and stems, suggesting that it is potentially active to transpose under normal growth conditions. Using dot-blot hybridization, the copy number of RIRE9 was estimated to be about 1600 copies per haploid rice genome. Five homologous copies of RIRE9 were assigned to five distinct positions of four chromosomes by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping approach using an indica-japonica rice doubled-haploid (DH) population and its molecular linkage map.
12136108	A novel gene organization: intronic snoRNA gene clusters from Oryza sativa.	2002	Nucleic Acids Res	Based on the analysis of structural features and conserved elements, 27 novel snoRNA genes have been identified from rice. All of them belong to the C/D box-containing snoRNA family except for one that belongs to the H/ACA box type. The newly found genes fall into six clusters that comprise at least three snoRNA genes, and in one case as many as nine genes. Interestingly, four of the six clusters are located within the largest intron of a protein coding gene. The majority of intronic snoRNA gene clusters are simply formed by multiple copies of the same species of snoRNA gene that possess the identical functional elements. This implies a possible mechanism of duplication for the origin of repeating snoRNA coding regions in one intron. However, a few intronic snoRNA gene clusters consisting of different snoRNAs species were also observed. Polycistronic precursors from two independently transcribed clusters were demonstrated by RT-PCR and individual snoRNAs processed from the polycistronic precursors were positively determined by reverse transcription assay. Analyses of the intergenic spacers in the clusters showed that, in addition to a very high AT content, the processing signals in rice snoRNA polycistronic transcripts might be different from those of yeast. Our results demonstrate that, in both plants and mammals, numerous snoRNAs can be produced simultaneously from an mRNA precursor of a host gene despite the different arrangements. The intronic snoRNA gene cluster is a novel gene organization, which is so far unique to plants. The conservation of intronic snoRNA gene clusters in plants was further demonstrated by the study of a similar snoRNA gene organization in the first intron of a Hsp70 gene from wild rice and Zizania caduciflora.
12815033	OsSET1, a novel SET-domain-containing gene from rice.	2003	J Exp Bot	A novel SET-domain-containing gene OsSET1 was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Its deduced protein consists of 895 amino acids. OsSET1 has a high degree of structure similarity to other SET-domain-containing genes such as CLF in higher plants and E(z) in animals. RT-PCR showed that the gene expresses throughout the entire plant. A transient expression assay in onion epidermis revealed that the OsSET1 protein is localized in nuclei. Over-expression of the SET domain of OsSET1 in Arabidopsis resulted in altered shoot development at seedling stages.
11929961	The defective kernel 1 (dek1) gene required for aleurone cell development in the endosperm of maize grains encodes a membrane protein of the calpain gene superfamily.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Endosperm of cereal grains is one of the most important renewable resources for food, feed, and industrial raw material. It consists of four triploid cell types, i.e., aleurone, starchy endosperm, transfer cells, and cells of the embryo surrounding region. In maize, the aleurone layer is one cell layer thick and covers most of the perimeter of the endosperm. Specification of maize aleurone cell fate is proposed to occur through activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-like receptor kinase CRINKLY4. A second maize gene essential for aleurone cell development is defective kernel 1 (dek1). Here we show that DEK1 shares high homology with animal calpains. The predicted 2,159-aa DEK1 protein has 21 transmembrane regions, an extracellular loop, and a cysteine proteinase domain that shares high homology with domain II of m-calpain from animals. We propose that DEK1 functions to maintain and restrict the aleurone cell fate imposed by CR4 through activation of its cysteine proteinase by contact with the outer endosperm surface. DEK1 seems to be the only member of the calpain superfamily in plants, Arabidopsis DEK1 sharing 70% overall identity with maize DEK1. The expression of dek1 in most plant tissues in maize and Arabidopsis, as well as its presence in a variety of higher plants, including angiosperms and gymnosperms, suggests that DEK1 plays a conserved role in plant signal transduction.
15951489	A sphingolipid elicitor-inducible mitogen-activated protein kinase is regulated by the small GTPase OsRac1 and heterotrimeric G-protein in rice 1[w].	2005	Plant Physiol	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated in plants during responses to pathogens or to pathogen-derived elicitors and mediate intracellular stress responses. Here, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) MAPK, OsMAPK6, was posttranslationally activated in a cell culture by a sphingolipid elicitor. Suppression of OsMAPK6 expression by RNA interference resulted in a strong reduction of pathogen-induced Phe ammonia-lyase mRNA, whereas the mRNA level of another rice MAPK, OsMAPK5a, was highly increased. Silencing of a small GTPase, OsRac1, by RNA interference or loss-of-function mutation (d1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha-subunit gene resulted in a strong reduction of the OsMAPK6 protein levels and of kinase activation by a sphingolipid elicitor. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with OsRac1 and OsMAPK6 proteins showed that OsMAPK6 is closely associated with the active form of OsRac1, but not with inactive forms of OsRac1. These results indicate that these two G-proteins regulate an elicitor-inducible MAPK in rice at the protein level.
12751334	Cloning and prokaryotic expression of a cDNA encoding a putative mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase in Oryza sativa.	2003	DNA Seq	Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) has been characterized as a key player in oxaloacetate (OAA) biosynthesis mechanism in citrate acid cycle that generates reducing powers for further assimilation in the whole cell. Here we present the cloning, characterization and prokaryotic expression of a putative Mdh (OsmMDH) in Oryza sativa. Sequence alignment shows that there is a high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of OsmMDH and MDH portein in Eucalyptus gunnii (80%), as well as between the deduced amino acid sequence of OsmMDH and other MDHs. Moreover, pI and the mitochondrial location of OsmMDH are predicted. The tissue-specific expression pattern of OsmMDH reveals that it is abundant in young panicle and immature seed, while its expression level is mush lower in leaf and root. Its expression in E. coli BL21 as a fusion gene is studied further.
15620222	Cloning, characterization and prokaryotic expression of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase from Oryza sativa.	2004	DNA Seq	cDNA sequences of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were cloned from various species, and MDH was identified to play an important role in cell energy metabolism. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of its homologue (OscMDH) in Oryza sativa. Comparison of the results to the genome details indicated that OscMDH consisted of seven exons. Sequence alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of OscMDH shared a significant similarity with cMDH protein in Zea mays, as well as with other cMDH gene products. The different expression patterns of OscMDH in different tissues revealed that OscMDH mRNA was highly transcribed in either young panicle or immature seed, while its abundance was much low in green leaf and root. A nearly 56-kDa fusion protein generated by adding a Trx-His-tag at the N-terminal of OscMDH was induced by IPTG in Escherichia coli BL21 and an obvious MDH activity was detected in the protein by native PAGE analysis. All these results suggest that OscMDH encodes a cytosolic MDH in rice.
15620214	Isolation, characterization and expression analysis of a leaf-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene in Oryza sativa.	2004	DNA Seq	Suppression subtractive hybridization was carried out to enrich gene fragments over-expressed in rice leaves by subtraction to rice roots, from which two identical cDNA fragments were identified to encode putative phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Then the corresponding full-length cDNA (Osppc) is isolated by RT-PCR and sequenced, which indicates an open reading frame of 2895bp is contained. Its deduced protein is encoded in 10 exons and shows high similarity to many other plant PEPCs. Comparing with maize and bacterial PEPCs, it is revealed that OSPPC shares many conserved domains and active sites that responsible for the structure, activity and regulation of this enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that OSPPC is grouped with C3 form PEPCs of wheat, maize and sorghum, which is consistent with the classification of rice. And a putative promoter element is predicted with DOF binding box, CAAT box and TATA box in the 5'-flanking sequence of Osppc gene. Moreover, Quantitative RT-PCR analyses are performed in hybrid rice and its parents, which show that Osppc is specifically expressed in leaf including leaf vein and sheath.
10677431	Cloning and functional characterization of a constitutively expressed nitrate transporter gene, OsNRT1, from rice.	2000	Plant Physiol	Elucidating how rice (Oryza sativa) takes up nitrate at the molecular level could help improve the low recovery rate (<50%) of nitrogen fertilizer in rice paddies. As a first step toward that goal, we have cloned a nitrate transporter gene from rice called OsNRT1. OsNRT1 is a new member of a growing transporter family called PTR, which consists not only of nitrate transporters from higher plants that are homologs of the Arabidopsis CHL1 (AtNRT1) protein, but also peptide transporters from a wide variety of genera including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. However, despite the fact that OsNRT1 shares a higher degree of sequence identity with the two peptide transporters from plants (approximately 50%) than with the nitrate transporters (approximately 40%) of the PTR family, no peptide transport activity was observed when OsNRT1 was expressed in either Xenopus oocytes or yeast. Furthermore, contrasting the dual-affinity nitrate transport activity of CHL1, OsNRT1 displayed only low-affinity nitrate transport activity in Xenopus oocytes, with a K(m) value of approximately 9 mM. Northern-blot and in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsNRT1 is constitutively expressed in the most external layer of the root, epidermis and root hair. These data strongly indicate that OsNRT1 encodes a constitutive component of a low-affinity nitrate uptake system for rice.
16169685	Identification and characterization of a novel water-deficit-suppressed gene OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein in rice.	2005	Gene	The aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD) family common to bacteria, plants and animals is involved in the methionine salvage pathway. A water-deficit-suppressed gene, OsARD encoding an aci-reductone-dioxygenase-like protein, was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the OsARD expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones. OsARD was mainly expressed in roots under flood conditions. It was suppressed by abiotic stresses including water deficit, high salinity and low temperature, and induced by ethylene and gibberellin acid (GA). Our results showed that the genes for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase were upregulated in RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with a significant reduction of OsARD expression. Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, ETR2 and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed. These results suggest that OsARD may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses.

8103599	Comparative linkage maps of the rice and maize genomes.	1993	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Genetic linkage maps have been constructed for the rice and maize genomes on the basis of orthologous loci detected with a common set of cDNA clones. Conserved linkage groups could be identified, which together account for more than two-thirds of both genomes. In some instances, entire chromosomes or chromosome arms are nearly identical with respect to gene order and gene content. The results also reveal that most of the genes (> 72%) duplicated during ancient polyploidization are still present in the maize genome in duplicate copy. The comparative maps of rice and maize provide a basis for interpreting molecular, genetic, and breeding information between these two important species and establish a framework for ultimately connecting the genetics of all grass species.
7903411	Homoeologous relationships of rice, wheat and maize chromosomes.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	A set of cDNA clones, which had previously been mapped onto wheat chromosomes, was genetically mapped onto the chromosomes of rice. The resulting comparative maps make it possible to estimate the degree of linkage conservation between these two species. A number of chromosomal rearrangements, some of which must have involved interchromosomal translocations, differentiate the rice and wheat genomes. However, synteny of a large proportion of the loci appears to be conserved between the two species. The results of this study, combined with those from a recently published comparative map of the rice and maize genomes, suggest that rice, wheat and maize share extensive homoeologies in a number of regions in their genomes. Some chromosomes (e.g. chromosome 4 in rice, chromosomes 2 and 2S in wheat and maize, respectively) may have escaped major rearrangement since the divergence of these species from their last common ancestor. Comparative maps for rice, wheat and maize should make it possible to begin uniting the genetics of these species and allow for transfer of mapping information (including centromere positions) and molecular marker resources (e.g. RFLP probes) between species. In addition, such maps should shed light on the nature of chromosome evolution that accompanied the radiation of grasses in the early stages of plant diversification.
7247938	Developmental modification and hybridization of allelic acid phosphatase isozymes in homo- and heterozygotes for the Acp- 1 locus in rice.	1981	Biochem Genet	A number of alleles each specified a set of three major and three minor bands of acid phosphatase (E.C. 3.1.3.2) in wild and cultivated rice strains. Relative intensity of the major bands was found to differ significantly according to the developmental stages of the leaves, suggesting the presence of protein modification genes. In heterozygotes, six parental and three hybrid bands were clearly observed in most of the heterozygotes, but the intensities of the hybrid bands were found to be generally lower than those theoretically expected due to random association of enzyme subunits. The cause of this phenomenon is discussed.
17248812	Inheritance of Semidwarfism in Rice, ORYZA SATIVA L.	1978	Genetics	The inheritance of plant height was investigated in a ten-parent diallel cross of diverse rice cultivars. Parents included two tall japonica lines and eight semidwarf lines. Data from parent, F(1), F(2 ), and F(3) generations indicated that the majority of height variation among the ten parents could be accounted for by three major genes with additive loci effects. D51, 72/2234-11, and G33 (derived from the known major-gene indica semidwarf Dee-geo-woo-gen) all were found to possess an allelic, partially recessive semidwarfing gene (sd(1)). Additional semidwarfing genes were detected in D66 (sd(2), fully recessive) and in CI 9858 (sd(3), partially to fully recessive). Relative magnitudes of additive effects were sd(1) > sd(2) >/= sd(3). Hokuriki 76, Tedoriwase, and IV 29-4 were found to be dwarfed by a multiple-gene system. Hayman-Jinks diallel cross analysis on parent and F(1) information (1974 and 1975) and on parent and F(2) information demonstrated the presence of significant additive and dominance variation, but epistasis was not detected. A preponderance of dominant alleles with partial dominance for increased plant height was observed. Since diallel statistics reflect properties of genes with larger effects, the genetic model proposed from segregation analysis was in substantial agreement with predictions of the Hayman-Jinks analysis.
18470071	Molecular tagging of genes for brown planthopper resistance and earliness introgressed from Oryza australiensis into cultivated rice, O. sativa.	1994	Genome	Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was carried out to tag the alien genes for brown planthopper (BPH) resistance and earliness introgressed from wild species Oryza australiensis into cultivated rice, O. sativa L. One introgression line (IR65482-4-136-2-2), resistant to biotypes 1, 2, and 3 of BPH and early in flowering, was selected from BC2F4 of the cross between O. sativa (IR31917-45-3-2) and O. australiensis (accession 100882). Recurrent parent, O. australiensis, and introgression line were surveyed for RFLP using probes of chromosomes 10 and 12. Two probes, RG457 and CDO98, detected introgression from O. australiensis. Cosegregation between introgressed characters and molecular markers was studied in F2 derived from the cross between the introgression line and recurrent parent. The gene for BPH resistance is linked with RG457 of chromosome 12 at a distance of 3.68 +/- 1.29 cM, and the gene for earliness is linked with CDO98 of chromosome 10 at a distance of 9.96 +/- 3.28 cM. Such close linkage is useful in marker-based selection while transferring BPH resistance from introgression line into other elite breeding lines. Introgression at the molecular level indicates that the mechanism of alien gene transfer is probably genetic recombination through crossing over rather than substitution of whole or large segment of chromosomes of wild species.
7913453	Comparative RFLP mapping of a wild rice, Oryza officinalis, and cultivated rice, O. sativa.	1994	Genome	A comparative RFLP map was constructed in a wild rice, Oryza officinalis, by using 139 genomic and cDNA probes that had been used previously to map RFLPs in O. sativa. Nine of the 12 chromosomes of O. officinalis were highly homosequential to those of O. sativa. A major rearrangement of gene order was detected in chromosome 1 and small inversions were found in chromosomes 3 and 11. Fourteen translocated RFLP markers were found, and chromosome 11 contained a high frequency of such translocated segments. Results were consistent with meiotic and trisomic analysis, which suggested that the genomes of O. officinalis and O. sativa were similar. Applications of comparative maps in plant breeding and gene cloning are discussed.
17246212	Primary trisomics of rice: origin, morphology, cytology and use in linkage mapping.	1984	Genetics	Twelve primary trisomics of Oryza sativa L. were isolated from the progenies of spontaneous triploids and were transferred by backcrossing to the genetic background of IR36, a widely grown high yielding rice variety. Eleven trisomics can be identified morphologically from one another and from diploids. However, triplo 11 is difficult to distinguish from diploid sibs.-The extra chromosome of each trisomic was identified cytologically at pachytene stage of meiosis, and the chromosomes were numbered according to their length at this stage. The major distinguishing features of each pachytene chromosome were redescribed.-The female transmission rates varied from 15.5% for triplo 1, the longest chromosome, to 43.9% for triplo 12, the shortest chromosome. Seven of the 12 primary trisomics transmitted the extra chromosome through the male. The low level of chromosomal imbalance tolerated by rice and other evidence are interpreted to indicate that this species is a basic diploid.-Genetic segregation for 22 marker genes in the trisomic progenies was studied. Of a possible 264 combinations, involving 22 genes and 12 trisomics, 120 were examined. Marker genes for each of the 12 chromosomes were identified. The results helped establish associations between linkage groups and cytologically identifiable chromosomes of rice for the first time. Relationships between various systems of numbering chromosomes, trisomics, linkage groups and marker genes are described, and a revised linkage map of rice is presented.

17248657	Analysis of genes controlling f(1) sterility in rice by the use of isogenic lines.	1974	Genetics	In order to look into the genetic basis of intervarietal F(1) sterility in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a series of backcrosses (up to B(13)) was carried out using Taichung 65 (Japonica type) as the recurrent parent and several Indica varieties as donor parents. A number of "isogenic F(1)-sterile lines" were isolated by test-crossing fertile F(2) plants obtained from the selfing of partly pollensterile backcross segregants. Crossing experiments with the isogenic lines confirmed the author's previous hypothesis that there are sets of duplicate gametic lethals (s genes) and that gametes carrying a double recessive combination (s(1)s(2)) of these deteriorate during development, though in the present hypothesis the genes are considered to affect the development of microspores only. Assuming that Taichung 65 has the genotype s(1)/s(1) + (2)/+(2) and a donor parent (like an isogenic F(1)-sterile line derived from it) has +(1)/+(1)s(2)/s(2), pollen grains with +(1)s(2) have shown a higher fertilizing capacity in the genetic background of Taichung 65 than those with s(1) +(2), while those with +(1) +(2) have a lower fertilizing capacity. This certational advantage of alien genes was considered to be an internal mechanism that helped the development of F(1) sterility relationships among rice varieties. The isogenic F(1)-sterile lines derived from different donor parents each had a set of s genes at different loci. Linkage relations were detected between the s loci and three gene markers.

1362973	Genetic and physical analysis of the rice bacterial blight disease resistance locus, Xa21.	1992	Mol Gen Genet	Nearly isogenic lines (NILs) of rice (Oryza sativa) differing at a locus conferring resistance to the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae were surveyed with 123 DNA markers and 985 random primers using restriction fragment length plymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. One chromosome 11 marker (RG103) detected polymorphism between the NILs that cosegregated with Xa21. All other chromosome 11 DNA markers tested were monomorphic between the NILs, localizing the Xa21 introgressed region to an 8.3 cM interval on chromosome 11. Furthermore, we identified two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (RAPD2148 and RAPD818) that detected polymorphisms between the NILs. Genomic sequences hybridizing with RAPD818, RAPD248 and RG103 were duplicated specifically in the Xa21 NIL. All three markers cosegregated with the resistance locus, Xa21, in a F2 population of 386 progeny. Based on the frequency with which we recovered polymorphic Xa21-linked markers, we estimated the physical size of the introgressed region to be approximately 800 kb. This estimation was supported by physical mapping (using pulsed field gel electrophoresis) of the sequences hybridizing with the three Xa21-linked DNA markers. The results showed that the three Xa21-linked markers are physically close to each other, with one copy of the RAPD818 sequences located within 60 kb of RAPD248 and the other copy within 270 kb of RG103. None of the enzymes tested generated a DNA fragment that hybridized with all three of the markers indicating that the introgressed region containing the resistance locus Xa21 is probably larger than 270 kb.
2341030	The genic nature of gamete eliminator in rice.	1990	Genetics	The two cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, are morphologically alike but are reproductively isolated from each other by hybrid sterility. The hybrid is male sterile but partially female fertile. Backcross experiments were conducted to introduce an alien factor controlling hybrid sterility from O. glaberrima (W025) into O. sativa (T65wx) and examine the genetic basis. An extracted sterility factor, closely linked to the wx locus, induced gametic abortion due to allelic interaction and was tentatively designated as S(t). The segregation patterns for infertility was explained by assuming that W025 and T65wx carried S(t) and S(t)a, respectively, and gametes with S(t)a aborted only in the heterozygote (S(t)/S(t)a) although the elimination of female gametes was incomplete. Thus, S(t) seemed to be intermediate between a gamete eliminator and pollen killer. However, S(t) was proven to be likely the same as S1 which was formerly reported as gamete eliminator in a different genetic background of O. sativa. In addition, a chromosomal segment containing S1 (or S(t] caused a marked suppression of crossing over around it, suggesting the presence of an inversion. Further, female transmission of S1a increased as the segment containing S1 became small by recombination. After S1 was further purified by successive backcrosses up to the BC15 generation, it became pollen killer. The present results give evidence that a profound sterility gene such as gamete eliminator can be made from accumulation of pollen killer and its modifier(s) when pollen killer and modifier(s) are linked, they behave as a gene complex in the hybrid.

7912216	RFLP mapping of genes conferring complete and partial resistance to blast in a durably resistant rice cultivar.	1994	Genetics	Moroberekan, a japonica rice cultivar with durable resistance to blast disease in Asia, was crossed to the highly susceptible indica cultivar, CO39, and 281 F7 recombinant inbred (RI) lines were produced by single seed descent. The population was evaluated for blast resistance in the greenhouse and the field, and was analyzed with 127 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Two dominant loci associated with qualitative resistance to five isolates of the fungus were tentatively named Pi-5(t) and Pi-7(t). They were mapped on chromosomes 4 and 11, respectively. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting partial resistance, RI lines were inoculated with isolate PO6-6 of Pyricularia oryzae in polycyclic tests. Ten chromosomal segments were found to be associated with effects on lesion number (P < 0.0001 and LOD > 6.0). Three of the markers associated with QTLs for partial resistance had been reported to be linked to complete blast resistance in previous studies. QTLs identified in greenhouse tests were good predictors of blast resistance at two field sites. This study illustrates the usefulness of RI lines for mapping a complex trait such as blast resistance and suggests that durable resistance in the traditional variety, Moroberekan, involves a complex of genes associated with both partial and complete resistance.
3408480	Chromosomal locations of ten isozyme loci in rice (Oryza sativa L.) through trisomic analysis.	1988	Biochem Genet	Chromosomal locations of 10 isozyme loci in rice (Oryza sativa L.) were determined through trisomic analysis. All 10 genes produced altered allozyme banding patterns in specific F1 trisomics. This served as the primary source of evidence for chromosome locations of Est-5, Icd-1, Acp-1, and Pgd-1. The locations of Amp-1, Amp-2, Amp-4, Pox-5, Got-1, and Cat-1 were further confirmed from segregation data in BC1 generations, as the ratios deviated significantly from 1:1 in the critical trisomics but agreed with the expected trisomic ratios. Triallelic heterozygotes were recovered for Amp-1 and Amp-2. On the basis of these data Got-1, Est-5, and Icd-1 were located to chromosome 1, Amp-1 to chromosome 2, Cat-1 and Pox-5 to chromosome 3, Acp-1 to chromosome 6, Amp-2 and Amp-4 to chromosome 8, and Pgd-1 to chromosome 11. Because Acp-2 and Pox-2 are known to be linked with Acp-1, they must also be on chromosome 6. The gene order and recombination values between isozyme loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, and 11 are presented.
7894488	A 300 kilobase interval genetic map of rice including 883 expressed sequences.	1994	Nat Genet	We have constructed a high resolution rice genetic map containing 1,383 DNA markers at an average interval of 300 kilobases (kb). The markers, distributed along 1,575 cM on 12 linkage groups, comprise 883 cDNAs, 265 genomic DNAs, 147 randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPD) and 88 other DNAs. cDNAs were derived from rice root and callus, analysed by single-run sequencing and searched for similarities with known proteins. Nearly 260 rice genes are newly identified and mapped, and genomic DNA and cloned RAPD fragments were also sequenced to generate STSs. Our map is the first significant gene expression map in plants. It is also the densest genetic map available in plants and the first to be backed up comprehensively by clone sequence data.
7896104	Saturated molecular map of the rice genome based on an interspecific backcross population.	1994	Genetics	A molecular map has been constructed for the rice genome comprised of 726 markers (mainly restriction fragment length polymorphisms; RFLPs). The mapping population was derived from a backcross between cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and its wild African relative, Oryza longistaminata. The very high level of polymorphism between these species, combined with the use of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA libraries, contributed to mapping efficiency. A subset of the probes used in this study was previously used to construct an RFLP map derived from an inter subspecific cross, providing a basis for comparison of the two maps and of the relative mapping efficiencies in the two crosses. In addition to the previously described PstI genomic rice library, three cDNA libraries from rice (Oryza), oat (Avena) and barley (Hordeum) were used in this mapping project. Levels of polymorphism detected by each and the frequency of identifying heterologous sequences for use in rice mapping are discussed. Though strong reproductive barriers isolate O. sativa from O. longistaminata, the percentage of markers showing distorted segregation in this backcross population was not significantly different than that observed in an intraspecific F2 population previously used for mapping. The map contains 1491 cM with an average interval size of 4.0 cM on the framework map, and 2.0 cM overall. A total of 238 markers from the previously described PstI genomic rice library, 250 markers from a cDNA library of rice (Oryza), 112 cDNA markers from oat (Avena), and 20 cDNA markers from a barley (Hordeum) library, two genomic clones from maize (Zea), 11 microsatellite markers, three telomere markers, eleven isozymes, 26 cloned genes, six RAPD, and 47 mutant phenotypes were used in this mapping project. Applications of a molecular map for plant improvement are discussed.
2535506	The rice phytochrome gene: structure, autoregulated expression, and binding of GT-1 to a conserved site in the 5' upstream region.	1989	Plant Cell	We have isolated and characterized both cDNA and genomic clones encoding the apoprotein of rice phytochrome. The mRNA produced from this gene is expressed at a low level in etiolated leaves. Following a flash of red light, the steady-state mRNA level decreases within 15 minutes, and is barely detectable after 2 hours. This effect is partially reversed by far red light demonstrating autoregulation of phytochrome mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on experiments show that this effect is exerted on transcription of the phytochrome gene. In etiolated plants, phytochrome mRNA is twofold higher in leaves than in roots, whereas the reverse is true in fully green plants where phytochrome mRNA accumulates despite illumination of the leaves. DNA gel blots and screening of libraries indicate the presence of only a single gene, allowing convenient study of the autoregulatory phenomenon for a specific phytochrome gene. Gel retardation analysis using a fragment from the 5' upstream region reveals that GT-1 is present in nuclear extracts of etiolated rice leaves and binds to sites conserved between rice and oat phytochrome genes.
8102907	Genetic and physical mapping of telomeres and macrosatellites of rice.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	Telomeres and telomere-associated satellites of rice were genetically and physically analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Arabidopsis telomeric DNA and rice satellite sequences as probes. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis telomeric sequences hybridize to rice telomeres under the conditions of high stringency. Using the Arabidopsis probe, multiple, discrete telomeric fragments could be identified on pulsed-field gel blots of rice DNAs digested with rare-cutting restriction enzymes. Most of the telomeric bands larger than 300 kb are physically linked with satellite bands as revealed by PFGE. Some of the telomeric and satellite bands segregate in a Mendelian fashion and are highly reproducible. Three such telomeric bands have been mapped to the distal ends of RFLP linkage groups: Telsm-1 on chromosome 8, Telsa-1 on chromosome 9 and Telsm-3 on chromosome 11. One segregating satellite band was mapped to an internal region of chromosome 10. Telomeric fragments were shown not only to be genetically linked to but also physically linked (based on PFGE) to the terminal RFLP markers. The physical distance from telomeric sequences to a distal RFLP marker, r45s gene, on chromosome 9, is 200 kb while the distance from telomeric sequences to RG98, a terminal RFLP marker on chromosome 11, is 260 kb. Physical maps of the telomere regions of chromosome 9 and chromosome 11 are presented.
2034221	Isolation and characterization of a rice gene encoding a basic chitinase.	1991	Mol Gen Genet	Chitinase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine linkages of the fungal cell wall polymer chitin, is involved in inducible defenses of plants. A basic chitinase genomic sequence was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic library using a bean chitinase gene fragment as a probe. The complete nucleotide sequence of the rice chitinase RCH10 gene was determined, and shown to contain an open reading frame with no introns, encoding a polypeptide of 336 amino acids. This polypeptide consists of a 21 amino acid signal peptide, a hevein domain, and a chitinase catalytic domain. The RCH10 gene has 63% identity at the nucleotide level and 75% identity at the amino acid level with chitinase genes from dicotyledonous plants such as bean, potato, and tobacco. A gene fusion of trpE and the coding region of RCH10 expressed in Escherichia coli gave a product that reacted with antiserum to bean chitinase, confirming the identity of RCH10 as a rice chitinase gene. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription start sites 53 bp and 55 bp upstream from the translation initiation codon. The 5' flanking region contains TATA and CAAT boxes, and the 3' region contains an AATAA polyadenylation signal. Southern blot hybridization indicated that there is a family of chitinase genes in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis showed that the RCH10 chitinase gene is induced in suspension cultured cells by a fungal cell wall elicitor. Rice chitinase transcripts accumulate to a high level in roots, but only low levels are found in stem and leaf tissue.
8681786	How is embryo size genetically regulated in rice?	1996	Development	It is unclear how embryo size is genetically regulated in plants. Since cereals have a large persisting endosperm, it is expected that embryo size is affected by endosperm development. Nine single recessive mutations, four reduced embryo mutations representing three loci, REDUCED EMBRYO1, REDUCED EMBRYO2 and REDUCED EMBRYO3, four giant embryo mutations derived from a single locus GIANT EMBRYO, and one endospermless mutation endospermless1-2 were analyzed. Every reduced embryo mutation caused reduction of all the embryonic organs including apical meristems and the enlargement of the endosperm. The giant embryo mutants have a reduced endosperm and an enlarged scutellum. However, shoot and radicle sizes were not affected. All the reduced embryo and giant embryo mutations did not largely affect postembryonic development. Accordingly, the expression of genes analyzed are seed-specific. In reduced embryo and giant embryo mutations, abnormalities were detected in both embryo and endosperm as early as 2 days after pollination. endospermless1-1 resulted in an early loss of endosperm, yielding a giant embryo, suggesting that embryo growth was physically limited by the endosperm. A double mutant between giant embryo-2 and club-shaped embryo1-1, which has a normal endosperm and a minute undifferentiated embryo, resulted in a club-shaped embryo1-1 embryo and a reduced endosperm of giant embryo-2, indicating that GIANT EMBRYO regulates the endosperm development. Double mutants between giant embryo-2 and three reduced embryo mutants exhibited the reduced embryo phenotype in both embryo and endosperm, suggesting that reduced embryo mutations cause the enlarged endosperm. Further, a double mutant of reduced embryo3 and endospermless1-1 showed the enlarged embryo in endospermless seed. This confirms that reduced embryo3 does not regulate embryo size but enlarges endosperm size. Together with the results of the other double mutant analysis, REDUCED EMBRYO1, REDUCED EMBRYO2, REDUCED EMBRYO3 and GIANT EMBRYO are concluded to regulate endosperm development.
8755613	A rice homeobox gene, OSH1, is expressed before organ differentiation in a specific region during early embryogenesis.	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Homeobox genes encode a large family of homeodomain proteins that play a key role in the pattern formation of animal embryos. By analogy, homeobox genes in plants are thought to mediate important processes in their embryogenesis, but there is very little evidence to support this notion. Here we described the temporal and spatial expression patterns of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1, during rice embryogenesis. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that in the wild-type embryo, OSH1 was first expressed at the globular stage, much earlier than organogenesis started, in a ventral region where shoot apical meristem and epiblast would later develop. This localized expression of OSH1 indicates that the cellular differentiation has already occurred at this stage. At later stages after organogenesis had initiated, OSH1 expression was observed in shoot apical meristem [except in the L1 (tunica) layer], epiblast, radicle, and their intervening tissues in descending strength of expression level with embryonic maturation. We also performed in situ hybridization analysis with a rice organless embryo mutant, orl1, that develops no embryonic organs. In the orl1 embryo, the expression pattern of OSH1 was the same as that in the wild-type embryo in spite of the lack of embryonic organs. This shows that OSH1 is not directly associated with organ differentiation, but may be related to a regulatory process before or independent of the organ determination. The results described here strongly suggest that, like animal homeobox genes, OSH1 plays an important role in regionalization of cell identity during early embryogenesis.
2148966	A chimeric gene containing the 5' portion of atp6 is associated with cytoplasmic male-sterility of rice.	1990	Mol Gen Genet	Three ATPase subunit 6 (atp6) genes of rice mitochondria were isolated, one from normal and two from cms-Bo male-sterile cytoplasms, in order to determine whether the extra atp6 gene in cms-Bo rice plays a role in cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS). The nucleotide sequences of all three genes were determined and analysis showed a chimeric atp6 gene (urf-rmc) as well as a normal atp6 gene in cms-Bo cytoplasm, but only the normal atp6 gene in normal cytoplasm. The urf-rmc gene is completely homologous to the normal atp6 gene from at least position -426 in the 5' flanking region to position +511 downstream from the initiation codon ATG: however, the following downstream sequence shows no homology with the normal rice atp6 gene, or any other reported sequence. Introduction of the restorer of fertility gene altered transcription of the urf-rmc gene but not the atp6 gene, indicating participation of the chimeric gene in the expression of CMS. Southern blot analysis showed that the urf-rmc gene was generated by an intramolecular recombination event in mitochondrial DNA, and the homologous recombination point between the atp6 gene and the opposite ancestral sequence was identified as 5'-TTCCCTC-3'.
8983188	A codominant DNA marker closely linked to the rice nuclear restorer gene, RF-1, identified with inter-SSR fingerprinting.	1996	Genome	A new molecular marker (OSRRf) closely linked to the nuclear restorer gene (Rf-1) for fertility in rice has been found. The Rf-1 gene is essential for hybrid rice seed production. A PCR-fingerprinting technique using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was applied to compare two near-isogenic lines with (MTC-10R) or without (MTC-10A) the Rf-1 gene. Of 76 inter-SSR primers tested, only one primer, (AG)8YC, generated polymorphisms. The tetranucleotide repeats generating polymorphisms were found within each amplicon. the genetic distance between OSRRf and Rf-1 was 3.7 +/- 1.1 cM. As in the case of a codominant marker, this marker will be applied not only to breeding both restorer lines and maintainer lines, but also to the purity management of hybrid rice seeds.
8984005	Cloning and mapping of variety-specific rice genomic DNA sequences: amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) from silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.	1996	Genome	An efficient technique for cloning DNA from silver-stained denaturing polyacrylamide gels was developed to allow the isolation of specific bands obtained from selective restriction fragment amplification (SRFA). This method proved as reliable as cloning radioactively labelled SRFA bands from the same gels. Rice DNA was used as a template, both with and without [32P]dCTP, using the same PCR profiles. Amplified products were separated using denaturing polyacryamide gel electrophoresis and visualized either by silver staining of gels or by autoradiography of 32P-labelled products. We cloned specific polymorphic SRFA bands directly from the denaturing polyacrylamide gels with one round of PCR amplification and confirmed that the sequences of the bands from silver-stained gels were identical to the corresponding 32P-labelled bands. The bands that were chosen represented amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) between japonica and indica rice varieties. We studied the ability of two cloned AFLP bands to serve as heritable genetic markers by mapping them as RFLPs in an interspecific rice population and found that they represented single-copy DNA at unique loci in the rice genome.
1356266	Chromosome location of Oryza sativa recombination linkage groups.	1992	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In situ hybridization, a powerful tool for the molecular cytogeneticist, can be used to physically map repetitive, low-copy, and unique DNA sequences in plant chromosomes. With the availability of a recombination map in Oryza sativa L. and an improved in situ hybridization technique, this study was designed to establish the relationship between the genetic and physical distances of the rice restriction fragment length polymorphism map. Analysis indicated that considerable variation can exist between genetic and physical maps. A 183-centimorgan linkage map for chromosome 2 covered less than 50% of the chromosome and did not include the centromere, whereas a 91-centimorgan linkage map for chromosome 1 covered approximately 80% of the chromosome. The results indicated that there are potential "hot" and "cold" spots of recombination and polymorphisms in rice, which involve both genes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms.
8156157	Computer-aided automatic identification of rice chromosomes by image parameters.	1993	Chromosome Res	An automatic, computer-aided method for identification of rice chromosomes was developed based on image parameters obtained by image analysis. Numerical data of the 360 condensation patterns (CPs) or the density profiles of rice chromosomes obtained from 30 chromosomal spreads of haploid rice were subjected to three different discrimination methods for identifying the chromosome: (1) discrimination flow chart, (2) linear discrimination functions, and (3) minimum distance classifier based on standardized Euclidean distance. Discrimination based on the minimum distance classifier resulted in the correct identification of more than 92% of the rice chromosomes. The first and second methods gave a correct identification of 91% and 84%, respectively. It is concluded that the 12 rice chromosomes in most spreads could be identified by a computer.
7651834	Rice-barley synteny and its application to saturation mapping of the barley Rpg1 region.	1995	Nucleic Acids Res	In order to facilitate the map-based cloning of the barley stem rust resistance gene Rpg1, we have demonstrated a high degree of synteny at a micro level between the telomeric region of barley chromosome 1P and rice chromosome 6. We have also developed and applied a simple and efficient method for selecting useful probes from large insert genomic YAC and cosmid clones. The gene order within the most terminal 6.5 cM of barley chromosome 1P was compared with the most terminal 2.7 cM of rice chromosome 6. Nine rice probes, previously mapped in rice or isolated from YAC or cosmid clones from this region, were mapped in barley. All, except one, were in synteny with the rice gene order. The exception, probe Y617R, was duplicated in barley. One copy was located on a different chromosome and the other in a non-syntenic position on barley chromosome 1P. The barley probes from this region could not be mapped to rice, but two of them were inferred to be in a syntenic location based on their position on a rice YAC. This work demonstrates the utility of applying the results of genetic and physical mapping of the small genome cereal rice to map-based cloning of interesting genes from large genome relatives.
9093864	Genetics of hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown in an intersubspecific rice (Oryza sativa L.) population.	1997	Genetics	F1 hybrid sterility and "hybrid breakdown" of F2 and later generations in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are common and genetically complicated. We used a restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage map and F4 progeny testing to investigate hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown in a cross between "widely compatible" O. sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Lemont from the Southern U.S. and ssp. indica cultivar Teqing from China. Our results implicate different genetic mechanisms in hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown, respectively. Hybrid sterility appeared to be due to recombination within a number of putative differentiated "supergenes" in the rice genome, which may reflect cryptic structural rearrangements. The cytoplasmic genome had a large effect on fertility of both male and female gametes in the F1 hybrids. There appeared to be a pair of complementary genes that behaved like "wide compatibility" genes. This pair of genes and the "gamete eliminator" (S1) or "egg killer" (S-5) may influence the phenotypic effects of presumed supergenes in hybrids. Hybrid breakdown appeared to be largely due to incompatibilities between indica and japonica alleles at many unlinked epistatic loci in the genome. These proposed mechanisms may partly account for the complicated nature of postreproductive barriers in rice.
8890522	Level of polymorphism and genetic mapping of AFLP markers in rice.	1996	Genome	Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) has been proposed as a valuable tool for gene mapping in plant species. We compared the levels of polymorphism for AFLP, RAPD, and microsatellite markers on 12 japonica and 2 indica rice cultivars. For AFLPs, seven EcoRI and seven MseI primers used in 18 primer combinations generated a total of 529 bands, of which 147 were clearly polymorphic among the accessions. The 21 RAPD primers produced 103 bands of which 43 were polymorphic. For the microsatellite markers the number of alleles per locus ranged from one (1 locus) to six. All marker types gave the same classification of the rice accessions into subspecies. Within japonica cultivars, the average percent polymorphism between any two accessions was 22% for AFLP, 24% for RAPD, and 36% for microsatellite markers (monomorphic bands excluded). The average percent polymorphism between indica and japonica accessions was 65, 35, and 76%, for AFLP, RAPD, and microsatellite markers, respectively. The total number of polymorphic bands was much higher for AFLPs, averaging over eight per gel. Seven AFLP primer combinations were assayed on 80 F2 plants of an indica x japonica cross previously mapped with RFLP markers. Of 54 AFLP bands scored, 50 could be mapped to specific chromosomes, and these appeared to be distributed throughout the rice genome. This indicates that AFLPs are a promising marker for mapping important genes in rice.

8851795	Development of a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) based indirect selection method for a dominant blast-resistance gene in rice.	1996	Genome	Two randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, OPF6(2700) and OPH18(2400), tightly linked to Pi-10, a dominant blast-resistance gene conferring complete resistance to isolate 106 (international race IB46) of the blast fungus were identified. To derive sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs) from OPF6(2700) and OPH18(2400), these amplified RAPD products were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence information, obtained for each end of the two linked RAPD markers, was used to design 24-mer oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the respective SCARs. Polymorphisms appearing as differences in the length of the SCAR's alternate alleles were considered for the indirect selection of Pi-10. Such polymorphisms converted the linked dominant RAPD loci into codominant SCAR markers and also facilitated the indirect scoring of the blast-resistant and blast-susceptible genotypes. The development of length variant codominant SCAR markers linked to a major gene for blast resistance in rice is described. The codominant SCARs will facilitate marker-assisted selection of the Pi-10 locus in rice breeding programs and will also be useful as genetic markers for high resolution mapping of the Pi-10 region.
8654913	Frequency of microsatellite sequences in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1995	Genome	This study was undertaken to estimate the relative frequencies of 13 microsatellite motifs in the rice genome as a basis for efficient development of a microsatellite map. Two dinucleotide, seven trinucleotide, and four tetranucleotide repeat motifs were end labelled and used as hybridization probes to screen genomic and cDNA libraries of rice, cv. IR36. Optimal washing temperatures for identification of clones containing specific microsatellite motifs were estimated based on washing temperatures near Td (dissociation temperature; Td = Tm - 7.6 degrees C). Sequencing of 20 putatively positive clones corresponding to each of 4 microsatellite motifs suggested that while Td provides a useful predictor of washing stringency for most of the repeats studied, those with a very high GC or AT content were most prone to error. The results from screening the rice genomic library suggest that there are an estimated 1360 poly(GA)n and 1230 poly(GT)n microsatellites in the rice genome, and that the relative frequency of different repeats decreased with increasing size of the motif. The most frequently observed microsatellites in the cDNA library were the same as for genomic library, but no poly(CGG)n, poly(ATC)n, or tetranucleotide motifs were observed among cDNA in this study.
8650237	Centromere mapping and orientation of the molecular linkage map of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice has become a model cereal plant for molecular genetic research. Rice has the most comprehensive molecular linkage maps with more than 2000 DNA markers and shows synteny and colinearity with the maps of other cereal crops. Until now, however, no information was available about the positions of centromeres and arm locations of markers on the molecular linkage map. Secondary and telotrisomics were used to assign restriction fragment length polymorphism markers to specific chromosome arms and thereby to map the positions of centromeres. More than 170 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were assigned to specific chromosome arms through gene dosage analysis using the secondary and telotrisomics and the centromere positions were mapped on all 12 linkage groups. The orientations of seven linkage groups were reversed to fit the "short arm on top" convention and the corrected map is presented.
8722800	Secondary trisomics and telotrisomics of rice: origin, characterization, and use in determining the orientation of chromosome map.	1996	Genetics	Secondary trisomics and telotrisomics representing the 12 chromosomes of rice were isolated from the progenies of primary trisomics. A large population of each primary trisomic was grown. Plants showing variation in gross morphology compared to the primary trisomics and disomic sibs were selected and analyzed cytologically at diakinesis and pachytene. Secondary trisomics for both arms of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 and for one arm of chromosomes 4, 5, 8, 9 and 12 were identified. Telotrisomics for short arm of chromosomes 1, 8, 9 and 10 and for long arms of chromosomes 2, 3 and 5 were isolated. These secondary and telotrisomics were characterized morphologically and for breeding behavior. Secondary trisomics 2n + 1S.1S, 2n + 1L.1L, 2n + 2S.2S, 2n + 2L.2L, 2n + 6S.6S, 2n + 6L.6L and 2n + 7L.7L are highly sterile, and 2n + 1L.1L, 2n + 2L.2L and 2n + 7L.7L do not set any seed even upon backcrossing. Telotrisomics are fertile and vigorous. Genetic segregation of 43 marker genes was studied in the F2 or backcross progenies. On the basis of segregation data, these genes were delimited to specific chromosome arms. Correct orientation of 10 linkage groups was determined and centromere positions on nine linkage groups were approximated. A revised linkage map of rice is presented.
18464818	Molecular mapping of a thermosensitive genetic male sterility gene in rice using bulked segregant analysis.	1997	Genome	The thermosensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS) system is considered to be a more efficient alternative to the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system for hybrid rice. An F2 population from a cross between a TGMS mutant line (IR32364TGMS) and IR68 was used to map the TGMS gene tms3(t). Fertile and sterile bulks were constructed following the classification of F2 plants into true breeding sterile, fertile, and segregating fertile plants based on F3 family studies. From the survey of 389 arbitrary primers in bulked segregant analysis, four RAPD markers were identified in which three, OPF182600, OPB19750, and OPAA7550, were linked to tms3(t) in repulsion phase and one, OPAC3640, was linked to tms3(t) in coupling phase. The tms3(t) gene was flanked by OPF182600 and OPAC3640 on one side and by OPAA7550 and OPB19750 on the other side. All four markers were low-copy sequences and two of them (OPF182600 and OPAC3640) detected polymorphism when the markers were used to probe the genomic blots. Subsequently, OPAC3640 was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6 using a mapping population available at IRRI. However, no RFLP markers from this region showed linkage to tms3(t) owing to the lack of polymorphism between the parents. All RAPD fragments were cloned and partially sequenced from both ends. Thus, PCR primers can be designed to develop PCR markers for marker-assisted breeding to facilitate the transfer of tms3(t) from one genetic background to another.
9205840	Ordered YAC clone contigs assigned to rice chromosomes 3 and 11.	1997	DNA Res	Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones were arranged on the positions of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers already mapped on the high-resolution genetic maps of rice chromosomes 3 and 11. From a total of 416 and 242 YAC clones selected by colony/Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 238 and 135 YAC clones were located on chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. For chromosomes 3 and 11, 24 YAC contigs and islands with total coverage of about 46% and 12 contigs and islands with coverage of about 40%, respectively, were assigned. Although many DNA fragments of multiple copy marker sequences could not be mapped to their original locations on the genetic map by Southern hybridization because of a lack of RFLP, the physical mapping of YAC clones could often assign specific locations of such multiple copy sequences on the genome. The information provided here on contig formation and similar sequence distribution revealed by ordering YAC clones will help to unravel the genome organization of rice as well as being useful in isolation of genes by map-based cloning.
9205839	Yeast artificial chromosome clones of rice chromosome 2 ordered using DNA markers.	1997	DNA Res	Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones were ordered for the physical mapping of rice chromosome 2, the last of the 12 rice chromosomes to be assigned YACs by the Rice Genome Research Program. A total of 128 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers and 4 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers located on our high-density genetic map were used for YAC clone landing. By colony/Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction screening, a total of 239 individual YACs were selected from our YAC library of 6934 clones covering six genome equivalents. The YACs located on the corresponding marker positions in the linkage map formed 43 contigs and islands and were estimated to encompass about 50% of the length of rice chromosome 2.
1860377	Localization of specific repetitive DNA sequences in individual rice chromosomes.	1991	Chromosoma	This paper describes the characterization and chromosomal distribution of three different rice (Oryza sativa) repetitive DNA sequences. The three sequences were characterized by sequence analysis, which gave 355, 498 and 756 bp for the length of the repeat unit in Os48, OsG3-498 and OsG5-756, respectively. Copy number determination by quantitative DNA slot-blot hybridization analysis showed 4000, 1080 and 920 copies, respectively, per haploid rice genome for the three sequences. In situ DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 95% of the silver grains detected with the Os48 probe were localized to euchromatic ends of seven long arms and one short arm out of the 12 rice chromosomes. For the OsG3-498 repetitive sequence, the majority of silver grains (58%) were also clustered at the same chromosomal ends as that of Os48. The minority (28%) of silver grains were located at heterochromatic short arms and centromeric regions. For the OsG5-756 repetitive sequence, 81% of the silver grains labeled the heterochromatic short arms and regions flanking all of the 12 centromeres. Thus, each of these three repetitive sequences was distributed at specific defined chromosomal locations rather than randomly at many chromosomal locations. The approximate copy number of a given repetitive DNA sequence at any specific chromosomal location was calculated by combining the information from in situ DNA hybridization analysis and the total copy number as determined by DNA slot-blot hybridization.
8654915	Genomic organization of 57 ribosomal protein genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) through RFLP mapping.	1995	Genome	Four hundred cDNA clones from rice (Oryza sativa L.) callus and root cDNA libraries, with a high similarity to about 70 kinds of ribosomal proteins (r-protein) in eukaryotic as well as procaryotic organisms, were identified by their deduced amino acid sequences. Southern hybridization of 114 independent cDNA clones with total rice genomic DNA showed 77 distinct and specific hybridization patterns. Of the 77 clones representing the above hybridization patterns, copies of 67 clones corresponding to 57 r-proteins could be estimated and, among these, only 6 clones were single copy, indicating that almost 90% of these r-proteins in rice were encoded by small multigene families. Loci of 36 r-protein genes could be mapped on the rice linkage map by using 30 full-length cDNA clone sequences from specific RELP bands. Another 21 expressed gene loci were mapped using 3' untranslated region specific cDNA probes amplified from the multicopy cDNA clones representing 17 of the r-protein multicopy gene families. The above 57 loci were mapped from 51 cDNA clones and 41 of these r-protein genes mapped to regions that did not show any clustering, while in 5 cases, pairs of r-protein genes cosegregated or linked closely. The r-protein genes in rice were located throughout the 12 chromosomes and it was found that more than one copy within a multigene family may be expressed simultaneously.
10409508	Initiation of shoot apical meristem in rice: characterization of four SHOOTLESS genes.	1999	Development	The regulatory mechanism of shoot apical meristem (SAM) initiation is an important subject in developmental plant biology. We characterized nine recessive mutations derived from four independent loci (SHL1-SHL4) causing the deletion of the SAM. Radicles were produced in these mutant embryos. Concomitant with the loss of SAM, two embryo-specific organs, coleoptile and epiblast, were lost, but the scutellum was formed normally. Therefore, differentiation of radicle and scutellum is regulated independently of SAM, but that of coleoptile and epiblast may depend on SAM. Regeneration experiments using adventitious shoots from the scutellum-derived calli showed that no adventitious shoots were regenerated in any shl mutant. However, small adventitious leaves were observed in both mutant and wild-type calli, but they soon became necrotic and showed no extensive growth. Thus, leaf primordia can initiate in the absence of SAM, but their extensive growth requires the SAM. An in situ hybridization experiment using a rice homeobox gene, OSH1, as a probe revealed that shl1 and shl2 modified the expression domain of OSH1, but normal expression of OSH1 was observed in shl3 and shl4 embryos. Accordingly, SHL1 and SHL2 function upstream of OSH1, and SHL3 and SHL4 downstream or independently of OSH1. These shl mutants are useful for elucidating the genetic program driving SAM initiation and for unraveling the interrelationships among various organs in grass embryos.
9108284	Two new genomes in the Oryza complex identified on the basis of molecular divergence analysis using total genomic DNA hybridization.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	The genus Oryza to which cultivated rice belongs has 24 species (2n = 24 or 48), representing seven genomes (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF, BBCC and CCDD). The genomic constitution of five of these species is unknown. These five species have been grouped into two species complexes, the tetraploid ridleyi complex (O. ridleyi, O. longiglumis) and the diploid meyeriana complex (O. granulata, O. meyeriana, O. indandamanica). To evaluate the genomic structure of these species in terms of divergence at the molecular level vis-a-vis other known genomes of Oryza, we used the total genomic DNA hybridization approach. Total genomic DNA (after restriction digestion) of 79 accessions of 23 Oryza species, 6 related genera, 5 outgroup taxa (2 monocots, 3 dicots) and 6 F1s and BC1s derived from crosses of O. sativa with wild species were hybridized individually with 32P-labeled total genomic DNA from 12 Oryza species: O. ridleyi, O. longiglumis, O. granulata, O. meyeriana, O. brachyantha, O. punctata, O. officinalis, O. eichingeri, O. alta, O. latifolia, O. australiensis, and O. sativa. The labeled genomic DNAs representing the ridleyi and meyeriana complexes cross-hybridized best to all the accessions of their respective species, less to those representing other genomes of Oryza and related genera, and least to outgroup taxa. In general, the hybridization differential measured in terms of signal intensities was >50-fold under conditions that permit detection of 70-75% homologous sequences, both in the presence and in the absence of O. sativa DNA as competitor. In contrast, when total DNAs representing other Oryza genomes were used as probes, species of the O. ridleyi and O. meyeriana complexes did not show any significant cross-hybridization (<5%). These results demonstrate that the genome(s) of both of these complexes are highly diverged and distinct from all other known genomes of Oryza. We, therefore, propose new genomic designations for these two species complexes: GG for the diploid O. meyeriana complex and HHJJ for the allotetraploid O. ridleyi complex. The results also suggest that the uniqueness of these genomes is not restricted to species-specific highly repetitive DNA sequences, but also applies to dispersed sequences present in single or low to moderate copy numbers. Furthermore these appear to share relatively more genome-specific repeat sequences between themselves than with other genomes of rice. The study also demonstrates the potential of total genomic DNA hybridization as a simple but powerful tool, complementary to existing approaches, for ascertaining the genomic makeup of an organism.
9097041	Physical mapping of rice chromosomes 8 and 9 with YAC clones.	1996	DNA Res	First efforts for physical mapping of rice chromosomes 8 and 9 were carried out by ordering YAC clones of a rice genomic DNA library covering six genome equivalents with mapped DNA markers. A total of 79 and 74 markers from chromosomes 8 and 9, respectively, were analyzed by YAC colony and Southern hybridization using RFLP markers of cDNA and genomic clones, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using PCR-derived and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. As a result, 252 YAC clones were confirmed to contain the mapped DNA fragments on both chromosomes. A contig map was constructed by ordering these YAC clones and about 53% and 43% genome coverage was obtained for chromosomes 8 and 9, respectively, assuming a YAC clone size of 350 kb and overlap between neighboring YACs of 50%. A continuous array of YAC clones with minimum overlap gave a total size of 18.9 Mb for chromosome 8 and 15.6 Mb for chromosome 9, which are close to previous estimates. These contig maps may provide valuable information that can be useful in understanding chromosome structure and isolating specific genes by map-based cloning.
9291955	Comparative genetics in the grasses.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Comparative genetic studies have demonstrated that gene content and orders are highly conserved, both at the map and megabase level, between different species within the grass family. Integration of the genetic maps of rice, foxtail millet, sugar cane, sorghum, maize, the Triticeae cereals and oats into a single synthesis reveals that some chromosome arrangements characterise taxonomic groups, while others have arisen during or after speciation. A detailed analysis of the comparative maps of seven species, belonging to three subfamilies, and their applications are described below.

7651833	Conservation of fine-scale DNA marker order in the genomes of rice and the Triticeae.	1995	Nucleic Acids Res	DNA markers distribute over large chromosomal regions exhibit conservation of order (collinearity) in different cereal species, but it is not known whether this is maintained on a finer scale, i.e. < or = 2 cM. To address this, sets of two or more genetically linked DNA markers were localised to yeast artificial chromosomes containing rice DNA inserts. Linkage analysis of these DNA markers in barley revealed complete correspondence with their genetic order in rice, the distance between linked sequences on rice chromosomes being < 1.6 cM or < or = 1 + 10(6) bp (1 Mb). Thus, DNA markers separated in this range are collinear in rice, barley and, by inference, other members of the Triticeae. These results are discussed with respect to the use of rice as a key system for the isolation of cereal genes.
9729767	Comparative mapping of the two wheat leaf rust resistance loci Lr1 and Lr10 in rice and barley.	1998	Genome	The wheat genome is large, hexaploid, and contains a high amount of repetitive sequences. In order to isolate agronomically important genes from wheat by map-based cloning, a simpler model of the genome must be used for identifying candidate genes. The objective of this study was to comparatively map the genomic regions of two wheat leaf rust disease resistance loci, Lr1 and Lr10, in the putative model genomes of rice and barley. Two probes cosegregating with the Lr1 gene on chromosome 5DL of wheat were studied. The rice sequences corresponding to the two probes were isolated and mapped. The two probes mapped to two different rice chromosomes, indicating that the organization of the region orthologous to Lr1 is different in rice and wheat. In contrast, synteny was conserved between wheat and barley in this chromosomal region. The Lrk10 gene cosegregated with Lr10 on chromosome 1AS in wheat. The rice gene corresponding to Lrk10 was mapped on rice chromosome 1, where it occurred in many copies. This region on rice chromosome 1 corresponds to the distal part of the group 3S chromosomes in Triticeae. The synteny is conserved between rice chromosome 1 and the Triticeae group 3S chromosomes up to the telomere of the chromosomes. On group 3S chromosomes, we found a gene that is partially homologous to Lrk10. We conclude that in the genomic regions studied, there is limited and only partially useful synteny between wheat and rice. Therefore, barley should also be considered as a model genome for isolating the Lr1 and Lr10 genes from wheat.
9475757	A high-density rice genetic linkage map with 2275 markers using a single F2 population.	1998	Genetics	A 2275-marker genetic map of rice (Oryza sativa L.) covering 1521.6 cM in the Kosambi function has been constructed using 186 F2 plants from a single cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare and the indica variety Kasalath. The map provides the most detailed and informative genetic map of any plant. Centromere locations on 12 linkage groups were determined by dosage analysis of secondary and telotrisomics using > 130 DNA markers located on respective chromosome arms. A limited influence on meiotic recombination inhibition by the centromere in the genetic map was discussed. The main sources of the markers in this map were expressed sequence tag (EST) clones from Nipponbare callus, root, and shoot libraries. We mapped 1455 loci using ESTs; 615 of these loci showed significant similarities to known genes, including single-copy genes, family genes, and isozyme genes. The high-resolution genetic map permitted us to characterize meiotic recombinations in the whole genome. Positive interference of meiotic recombination was detected both by the distribution of recombination number per each chromosome and by the distribution of double crossover interval lengths.
9291976	Retrotransposons of rice: their regulation and use for genome analysis.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Retrotransposons were extensively surveyed in rice using two molecular methods. The total copy number of retrotransposons in the rice genome was estimated to be about 1000 and 32 families were isolated, showing that retrotransposons are a major class of transposable elements in rice. Although these retrotransposons appear inactive during normal growth conditions, 5 out of 32 families were active under tissue culture conditions. The most active element, Tos17, was studied in detail. Its activity was show to be regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. The analysis of target sites of transposition indicated that activation of Tos17 is an important cause of tissue culture-induced mutations in rice. Tissue culture-induced activation of Tos17 was used to develop the site-selected mutagenesis system, in which mutants carrying a Tos17 insertion in the gene of interest can be identified among rice plants regenerated from tissue culture by the PCR using one primer for the ends of Tos17 and another for the gene of interest. This system will contribute to understanding the functions of rice genes whose sequences are being determined by the rice genome project.
9291966	A rapid and accurate strategy for rice contig map construction by combination of fingerprinting and hybridization.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	A rapid and accurate strategy for rice contig map construction was described. Rice BAC library with average insert of 120 kb in length was used as building materials in contig mapping. The contigs of varied lengths ranging from 500 kb to several megabases with sufficient redundancy to ensure the accuracy of the joining between individual BACs were formed by fingerprinting. The contigs were then assigned to and ordered along the chromosomes by various molecular markers through their hybridization against the whole rice genomic library. The accuracy of clone overlaps in contig was further confirmed by the existence in contigs of well fit stacks of marker-lodged clones. He contigs thus obtained covered nearly the rice genome.
7914758	Comparative RFLP mapping of an allotetraploid wild rice species (Oryza latifolia) and cultivated rice (O. sativa).	1994	Plant Mol Biol	The purpose of this study was to construct a comparative RFLP map of an allotetraploid wild rice species, Oryza latifolia, and to study the relationship between the CCDD genome of O. latifolia and the AA genome of O. sativa. A set of RFLP markers, which had been previously mapped to the AA genome of cultivated rice, were used to construct the comparative map. Fifty-eight F2 progeny, which were derived from a single F1 plant, were used for segregation analysis. The comparative RFLP map contains 149 DNA markers, including 145 genomic DNA markers from cultivated rice, 3 cDNA markers from oat, and one known gene (waxy, from maize). Segregation patterns reflected the allotetraploid ancestry of O. latifolia, and the CC and DD genomes were readily distinguished by most probes tested. There is a high degree of conservation between the CCDD genome of O. latifolia and the AA genome of O. sativa based on our data, but some inversions and translocations were noted.
9484474	Three cis-elements required for rice alpha-amylase Amy3D expression during sugar starvation.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	Expression of alpha-amylase genes during seedling development plays a key role in production of sugar from the starch stored in the cereal seed. Rice alpha-amylase Amy3D promoter/GUS constructs in transgenic rice cell lines were studied to identify cis elements in the promoter of this metabolite-regulated gene. Three sequences having the greatest effects on Amy3D gene expression included the amylase element (TATCCAT), the CGACG element, and a G box-related element (CTACGTGGCCA). These promoter cis elements are needed for high-level expression of Amy3D under conditions of sugar starvation. The involvement of G box cis-elements in environmental stress responses suggest a link between the nutrient stress and the environmental stress responses of the plant.
9267430	Silencing of waxy genes in rice containing Wx transgenes.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	In order to study gene silencing in a monocot system we introduced a waxy (Wx) gene into rice. In the pollen grain of the transgenic wild-type plants, two types of Wx gene silencing were observed: Type I in which all the pollen grains showed the mutant (wx) phenotype, and Type II in which 50% of the pollen grains showed the wx phenotype. Analysis of Wx gene expression in the progeny of selfing and outcrossing indicated that Wx gene silencing was meiotically transmitted to the offspring. The number of transgene copies and transgene loci was determined by Southern blot analysis and suggested that the Wx transgene may have a paramutagenic effect on the endogenous Wx genes. In contrast to the pollen grain, the wx phenotype was not observed in the endosperm. However, the level of WAXY (WX) protein in the endosperm of Type I lines was similar to that in non-transgenic seed, while in Type II lines two classes of seeds, showing high and low levels of the protein segregated. When the same transgene was introduced into wx mutants in which no Wx transcript was detectable, the transgene behaved as a dominant Mendelian factor and no silencing was found, suggesting that the activity of the endogenous Wx gene influences the silencing phenomenon. Our study of Wx gene silencing in rice extends the well-known phenomenon of gene silencing, so far observed mainly in dicots, to a cereal.
9291975	Transposon tagging in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	To develop an efficient gene isolation method for rice we introduced the maize Ac/Ds system into rice. Extensive analysis of their behavior in rice for several generations indicated that Ac and Ds in the presence of Ac transposase gene actively transpose in rice. A wide spectrum of mutations affecting growth, morphogenesis, flowering time and disease resistance have been obtained in the population carrying Ac/Ds and some of them were genetically analyzed. Main efforts are currently being made to isolate genes responsible these mutations. In addition, a number of Ac/Ds were mapped on chromosomes and mapped elements will be used in the future for directed tagging of genes with known chromosomal positions.
7753830	Metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of the rice genome with bacterial artificial chromosomes.	1995	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful tool for physical mapping in human and other mammalian species. However, application of the FISH technique has been limited in plant species, especially for mapping single- or low-copy DNA sequences, due to inconsistent signal production in plant chromosome preparations. Here we demonstrate that bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones can be mapped readily on rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosomes by FISH. Repetitive DNA sequences in BAC clones can be suppressed efficiently by using rice genomic DNA as a competitor in the hybridization mixture. BAC clones as small as 40 kb were successfully mapped. To demonstrate the application of the FISH technique in physical mapping of plant genomes, both anonymous BAC clones and clones closely linked to a rice bacterial blight-resistance locus, Xa21, were chosen for analysis. The physical location of Xa21 and the relationships among the linked clones were established, thus demonstrating the utility of FISH in plant genome analysis.
12226172	Coordinated Regulation of the Genes Participating in Starch Biosynthesis by the Rice Floury-2 Locus.	1996	Plant Physiol	The recessive floury-2 (flo-2) locus of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is located on chromosome 4, causes a strong reduction in expression of the gene encoding an isoform of branching enzyme RBE1 in immature seeds 10 d after flowering. Mapping of the RBE1 gene demonstrated the localization on rice chromosome 6, suggesting that the wild-type Floury-2 (Flo-2) gene regulates RBE1 gene expression in trans. However, reduced expression of the genes encoding some other starch-synthesizing enzymes, including another isoform of branching enzyme RBE3 and granule-bound starch synthase, was also found in the flo-2 seeds. In spite of the low level of RBE1 gene expression in the immature seeds of the flo-2 mutants, the RBE1 gene was equally expressed in the leaves of the wild type and flo-2 mutants. Thus, these results imply that the Flo-2 gene may co-regulate expression of some of the genes participating in starch synthesis possibly in a developing seed-specific manner.
9291972	Towards map-based cloning of the barley stem rust resistance genes Rpg1 and rpg4 using rice as an intergenomic cloning vehicle.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The barley stem rust resistance genes Rpg1 and rpg4 were mapped in barley on chromosomes 1P and 7M, respectively and the syntenous rice chromosomes identified as 6P and 3P by mapping common probes in barley and rice. Rice yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and cosmid clones were used to isolate probes mapping to the barley Rpg1 region. The rice BAC isolated with the pM13 probe was a particularly excellent source of probes. A high-resolution map of the Rpg1 region was established with 1400 gametes yielding a map density of 3.6 markers per 0.1 cM. A detailed physical map was established for the rice BAC fragment containing the Rpg1-flanking markers pM13 and B24. This fragment covers a barley genetic distance of 0.6 cM and a rice DNA physical distance of ca. 70 kb. The distribution of barley cross-overs in relation to the rice DNA physical distances was extremely uneven. The barley genetic distance between the pM13 marker and Rpg1 was 0.1 cM per ca. 55 kb, while on the proximal side it was 0.5 cm per ca. 15 kb. Three probes from the distal end of the pM13 BAC mapped 3.0 cm proximal of Rpg1 and out of synteny with rice. These experiments confirm the validity of using large insert rice clones as probe sources to saturate small barley (and other large genome cereals) genome regions with markers. They also establish a note of caution that even in regions of high microsynteny, there may be small DNA fragments that have transposed and are no longer in syntenous positions.
9862503	Isolation of a cDNA for tryptophan synthase beta from rice and studies of its expression in a 5-methyltryptophan-resistant mutant of rice.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA clone encoding rice tryptophan synthase beta (TSB) was isolated and its transcript level was examined in TR-No. 73, a derivative of a previously isolated rice mutant (TR-1) that is resistant to 5-methyltryptophan. The cDNA sequence of the rice gene for TSB was very similar to that of genes for TSB from other plants. Northern blotting analysis revealed that the steady-state level of TSB mRNA in the 5MT-resistant mutant TR-No. 73 was 1.3 times higher than the level of TSB mRNA in control rice plants under standard conditions. The level of TSB mRNA in control rice plants decreased after treatment of plants with 5MT. Similarly, the level of TSB mRNA in TR-No. 73 initially decreased, although less so than in control rice. However, after 12 h of treatment with 5MT, the level of the transcript in TR-No. 73 returned to the level under standard conditions. The activity of tryptophan synthase (TS) in seedlings of TR-No. 73 was about 2.3 times higher than that in seedlings of control rice under standard conditions.
9179493	Physical mapping of rice chromosomes 4 and 7 using YAC clones.	1997	DNA Res	Physical maps of rice chromosomes 4 and 7 were constructed by landing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) along our high-density molecular linkage map. Using 114 DNA markers, 258 individual YACs were located on chromosome 4. Sixty-two out of 258 YACs carried two or more DNA marker positions and formed 16 contigs which covered a total length of 17.1 cM. The other YACs were arranged to 23 positions. On chromosome 7, 203 individual YACs were landed on 109 DNA markers. Sixty-four out of 203 YACs formed 15 contigs which covered a total length of 21.8 cM and 139 YACs were localized to 26 positions. Chromosomes 4 and 7 were covered with minimum tiling paths of 45 and 48 YACs, respectively. Taking the average size of YAC insert DNA to be 350 kb and the entire genome size to be 430 Mb, about 16-18 Mb of each chromosome or an estimated 50% of their total lengths have been covered with YACs. Physical maps of these 2 chromosomes should be of great help in identifying useful trait genes and unraveling genetic and biological characteristics in rice.
9291964	Physical mapping of the rice genome with YAC clones.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Construction of a rice physical map covered by YAC clones which have been arranged over half of the genome length is presented here. A total of 1285 RFLP and RAPD markers almost evenly distributed on the rice genetic map could select 2974 YAC clones and 2443 clones of them were located on their original positions. Rice YACs carrying 350 kb average insert fragments of 2443 clones could cover 222 megabase length of the rice genome, corresponding to 52% of the whole genome size (4.3 Mb). Chromosome landing with many YAC clones on the high-density genetic map loci efficiently integrated the genetic map with a physical map. This is the first step to generate a comprehensive genome map of rice. An integrated genome map should be an indispensable tool to figure out genome structure as well as to clone trait genes by map-based cloning.
9291970	Comparative genetics of flowering time.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Analysis of genes controlling flowering time (heading date) contributes to our understanding of fundamental principles of plant development and is of practical importance because of the effects of flowering time on plant adaptation and crop yield. This review discusses the extent to which plants may share common genetic mechanisms for the control of flowering time and the implications of such conservation for gene isolation from the major cereal crops. Gene isolation may exploit the small genome of rice in map-based approaches, utilizing the conservation of gene order that is revealed when common DNA markers are mapped in different species. Alternatively, mechanisms may be conserved within plants as a whole, in which case genes cloned from the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana provide an alternative route.
8541495	Analysis of randomly isolated cDNAs from developing endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.): evaluation of expressed sequence tags, and expression levels of mRNAs.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Using a cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA from 10-day-old rice endosperm, partial nucleotide sequences of randomly isolated clones were analyzed. A total of 153 (30.6%) out of 500 cDNA clones showed high amino acid identity to previously identified genes. There was significant redundancy in cDNAs encoding prolamine and glutelin. About 21.0% of the cDNA clones were found to code for seed storage protein genes. Consequently, 37 independent genes were identified. Using cDNA clones encoding glutelin, prolamine, seed allergen, alpha-1,4-glucan branching enzyme, glycine-rich RNA binding protein, metallothionein, non-specific lipid-transfer protein and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme the accumulation of mRNA during rice seed development was compared. Genes associated with seed storage protein and starch biosynthesis were expressed according to expected developmental stages. Glycine-rich RNA binding protein genes as well as metallothionein-like protein genes were highly expressed in developing seeds, but low in leaves of whole plants.
9291963	Microsatellite marker development, mapping and applications in rice genetics and breeding.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Microsatellites are simple, tandemly repeated di- to tetra-nucleotide sequence motifs flanked by unique sequences. They are valuable as genetic markers because they are co-dominant, detect high levels of allelic diversity, and are easily and economically assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results from screening a rice genomic library suggest that there are an estimated 5700-10,000 microsatellites in rice, with the relative frequency of different repeats decreasing with increasing size of the motif. A map consisting of 120 microsatellite markers demonstrates that they are well distributed throughout the 12 chromosomes of rice. Five multiple copy primer sequences have been identified that could be mapped to independent chromosomal locations. The current level of genome coverage provided by these simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs) in rice is sufficient to be useful for genotype identification, gene and quantitative trail locus (QTL) analysis, screening of large insert libraries, and marker-assisted selection in breeding. Studies of allelic diversity have documented up to 25 alleles at a single locus in cultivated rice germplasm and provide evidence that amplification in wild relatives of Oryza sativa is generally reliable. The availability of increasing numbers of mapped SSLP markers can be expected to complement existing RFLP and AFLP maps, increasing the power and resolution of genome analysis in rice.
7584040	Determination of RAPD markers in rice and their conversion into sequence tagged sites (STSs) and STS-specific primers.	1994	DNA Res	We produced 102 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers mapped on all 12 chromosomes of rice using DNAs of cultivars Nipponbare (japonica) and Kasalath (indica) and of F2 population generated by a single cross of these parents. Sixty random primers 10 nucleotides long were used both singly and in random pairs and about 1,400 primer-pairs were tested. Using both agarose gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enabled us to detect polymorphisms appearing in the range from < 100 bp to 2 kb. The loci of the RAPD markers were determined onto the framework of our RFLP linkage map and some of these markers were mapped to regions with few markers. Out of the 102 RAPD markers, 20 STSs (sequence-tagged sites) and STS-specific primer pairs were determined by cloning, identifying and sequencing of the mapped polymorphic fragments.
8581735	Screening of RAPD markers linked to the photoperiod-sensitivity gene in rice chromosome 6 using bulked segregant analysis.	1995	DNA Res	Bulked segregant analysis was used to determine randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers in a specific interval in the middle of chromosome 6 of rice for tagging the photoperiod sensitivity gene. Two pools of F2 individuals (japonica cv. Nipponbare and indica cv. Kasalath) were constructed according to the genotypes of three restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers located at both ends and the middle of the targeted interval. Then another pair of pools were constructed based on the "graphical genotype," which was made with our high density linkage map. RAPD analysis was performed using these DNA pools as templates, and polymorphic fragments were detected and mapped. Using 80 primers, either singly or pairwise, we tested 2,404 primer pairs and established 14 markers tightly linked to the photoperiod sensitivity gene. The obtained RAPD markers were converted into sequence-tagged sites by cloning and sequencing of the polymorphic fragments and they can be used directly for construction of physical maps. This bulked segregant method can be applied for any species and any region of interest in which detailed linkage maps or physical maps are needed.
9291956	Are rice chromosomes components of a holocentric chromosome ancestor?	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Comparative genomics reveals that cereal genomes are composed of similar genomic building blocks (linkage blocks). By stacking these blocks in a unique order, it is possible to construct a single ancestral 'chromosome' which can be cleaved to give the basic structure of the 56 different chromosomes found in wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet and sugarcane. The borders of linkage blocks are defined by cereal centromeric and telomeric sites. However, a number of studies have shown that telomeric heterochromatin has neocentromeric activity, implying that linkage blocks are in fact defined by centromeric-like sites with conserved sequences. The structure of the ancestral cereal genome thus resembles a holocentric chromosome, which is the chromosome structure shared by the closest relatives of the Gramineae, the Cypericeae and Juncaceae.
9291962	Rice molecular genetic map using RFLPs and its applications.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	In the past decade, notable progress has been made in rice molecular genetic mapping using genomic or cDNA clones. A total of over 3000 DNA markers, mainly with RFLPs, have been mapped on the rice genome. In addition, many studies related to tagging of genes of interest, gene isolation by map-based cloning and comparative mapping between cereal genomes have advanced along with the development of a high-density molecular genetic map. Thus rice is considered a pivotal plant among cereal crops and, in addition to Arabidopsis, is a model plant in genome analysis. In this article, the current status of the construction of rice molecular genetic maps and their applications are reviewed.
10659779	Genomic organization of the 260 kb surrounding the waxy locus in a Japonica rice	1999	Genome	The present study was carried out to characterize the molecular organization in the vicinity of the waxy locus in rice. To determine the structural organization of the region surrounding waxy, contiguous clones covering a total of 260 kb were constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from the Shimokita variety of Japonica rice. This map also contains 200 overlapping subclones, which allowed construction of a fine physical map with a total of 64 HindIII sites. During the course of constructing the map, we noticed the presence of some repeated regions which might be related to transposable elements. We divided the 260-kb region into 60 segments (average size of 5.7 kb) to use as probes to determine their genomic organization. Hybridization patterns obtained by probing with these segments were classified into four types: class 1, a single or a few bands without a smeared background; class 2, a single or a few bands with a smeared background; class 3, multiple discrete bands without a smeared background; and class 4, only a smeared background. These classes constituted 6.5%, 20.9%, 3.7%, and 68.9% of the 260-kb region, respectively. The distribution of each class revealed that repetitive sequences are a major component in this region, as expected, and that unique sequence regions were mostly no longer than 6 kb due to interruption by repetitive sequences. We discuss how the map constructed here might be a powerful tool for characterization and comparison of the genome structures and the genes around the waxy locus in the Oryza species.
9080684	Identification and characterization of two tandem repeat sequences (TrsB and TrsC) and a retrotransposon (RIRE1) as genome-general sequences in rice.	1996	Genes Genet Syst	Three kinds of DNA sequences (here called TrsB, TrsC and RIRE1) have been previously reported to be those repeated in tandem specifically in the wild rice species with FF, CC or EE genome, respectively. To characterize these genome type-specific sequences, we carried out PCR using a pair of primers, which hybridize to a restricted region in the repeating unit sequence and prime DNA synthesis in both directions. Gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing revealed that PCR using primers for TrsB (or TrsC) amplified the fragments with an integral series of a unit length not only from total DNA of the rice strain with FF (or CC) genome, but also from those of the rice strains with non-FF (or non-CC) genome. TrsB or TrsC was, however, found to be repeated in an extraordinary number of copies in the species with FF or CC genome, respectively, in which the TrsB (or TrsC) sequence has been originally identified. PCR using primers for RIRE1 produced various sizes of fragments from total DNA of the rice strains with EE genome. The fragments, however, showed no progression at interval of the unit length characteristic for tandem repeats. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified fragments revealed that they were not the sequences repeated in tandem, but were those interspersed as an element having partial homology with the LTR sequences of retrotransposons, Wis-2-1A in wheat and BARE-1 in barley. RIRE1 was present in the rice species with any types of genomes, but in the species with EE genome in an extraordinary number of copies.
9202377	Construction of an 800-kb contig in the near-centromeric region of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta2 using a highly representative rice BAC library.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	We constructed a rice Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library from green leaf protoplasts of the cultivar Shimokita harboring the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta. The average insert size of 155 kb and the library size of seven genome equivalents make it one of the most comprehensive BAC libraries available, and larger than many plant YAC libraries. The library clones were plated on seven high density membranes of microplate size, enabling efficient colony identification in colony hybridization experiments. Seven percent of clones carried chloroplast DNA. By probing with markers close to the blast resistance genes Pi-ta2(closely linked to Pi-ta) and Pi-b, respectively located in the centromeric region of chromosome 12 and near the telomeric end of chromosome 2, on average 2.2 +/- 1.3 and 8.0 +/- 2.6 BAC clones/marker were isolated. Differences in chromosomal structures may contribute to this wide variation in yield. A contig of about 800 kb, consisting of 19 clones, was constructed in the Pi-ta2 region. This region had a high frequency of repetitive sequences. To circumvent this difficulty, we devised a "two-step walking" method. The contig spanned a 300 kb region between markers located at 0 cM and 0.3 cM from Pi-ta. The ratio of physical to genetic distances (> 1,000 kb/cM) was more than three times larger than the average of rice (300 kb/cM). The low recombination rate and high frequency of repetitive sequences may also be related to the near centromeric character of this region. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a BAC clone from the Pi-b region yielded very clear signals on the long arm of chromosome 2, while a clone from the Pi-ta2 region showed various cross-hybridizing signals near the centromeric regions of all chromosomes.
9230893	Mapping QTLs for submergence tolerance in rice by AFLP analysis and selective genotyping.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	By combining the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique with selective genotyping, we constructed a linkage map for rice and assigned each linkage group to a corresponding chromosome. The AFLP map, consisting of 202 AFLP markers, was generated from 74 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) which were selected from both extremes of the population (250 lines) with respect to the response to complete submergence. Map length was 1756 cM, with an average interval size of 8.5 cM. To assign linkage groups to chromosomes, we used 50 previously mapped AFLP markers as anchor markers distributed over the 12 chromosomes. Other AFLP markers were then assigned to specific chromosomes based on their linkage to anchor markers. This AFLP map is equivalent to the RFLP/AFLP map constructed previously as the anchors were in the same order in both maps. Furthermore, tests with two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and two sequence-tagged site (STS) markers showed that they mapped in the expected positions. Using this AFLP map, a major gene for submergence tolerance was localized on chromosome 9. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with submergence tolerance were detected on chromosomes 6, 7, 11, and 12. We conclude that the combination of AFLP mapping and selective genotyping provides a much faster and easier approach to QTL identification than the use of RFLP markers.
9426615	Visual verification of close disposition between a rice A genome-specific DNA sequence (TrsA) and the telomere sequence.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	A rice A genome-specific tandem repeat sequence (TrsA) and telomeric nucleotide sequences, (TTTAGGG)n, were simultaneously detected by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (McFISH) using rice prometaphase chromosomes. Six pairs of TrsA sites visualized by fluorescence signals were all localized on the long arms close to the telomeric regions. Differences in the copy number of TrsA at the different sites were visualized both by the size of the telomeric condensation block stained with Giemsa solution and the signal intensity after FISH with TrsA. McFISH analyses using interphase nuclei could resolve close disposition of TrsA and telomere and also gave rough estimation of the distance between them. The functional significance of the close disposition of TrsA and telomere is discussed.
9202415	Comparative evaluation of within-cultivar variation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using microsatellite and RFLP markers.	1997	Genome	The objective of this study was to determine an efficient way of detecting within-cultivar variation in rice varieties obtained from national and international germplasm collections. Seventy-one rice cultivars were evaluated for within-cultivar variation using a combination of phenotypic, RFLP, and microsatellite or simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP). Variation between individuals within and accession and between duplicate accessions within a cultivar was detected even in cultivars that had been purified by phenotypic evaluation. Landrace cultivars were more heterogeneous and displayed a larger number of both RFLP and SSLP alleles than did modern cultivars. Microsatellite markers detected a greater number of alleles and were able to discriminate between even closely related individuals more efficiently than RFLPs. Some microsatellite markers were more informative than others for assessing genetic diversity. Single markers revealed 5.6-61.1% of the total variation detected by the 10 SSLP markers. Some marker combinations were complementary, providing more information than others. Several combinations of 4 SSLP markers detected as much as 94% of the total within-cultivar variation detected by the 10 SSLP markers. These results suggest that the use of four well-chosen microsatellites would be an efficient method for evaluating the heterogeneity of rice accessions.
7605516	McGill: analyzing the data.	1995	Science	
9291969	QTL analysis to study the association between leaf size and abscisic acid accumulation in droughted rice leaves and comparisons across cereals.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Plants accumulate abscisic acid (ABA) under droughted conditions. Genetic variation in the accumulation of ABA in deteched and partially dehydrated leaves of rice has previously been reported, and this was found to be associated with variation in leaf size (smaller leaves made more ABA). Correlation analysis failed to distinguish clearly between a causal relationship between the two traits and close genetic between loci controlling the traits. Here we present a detailed genetic analysis of ABA accumulation in detached and partially dehydrated rice leaves. using a population of F2 plants generated from the lowland x upland cross IR20 (high-ABA) x 63-83 (low-ABA) which was mapped with RFLP and AFLP markers. Several highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ABA accumulation and leaf weight were identified. Only one of the minor QTLs for ABA accumulation (accounting for only 4% of the phenotypic variance) was coincident with any QTLs for leaf size such that the high-ABA allele was associated with smaller leaves. This analysis, therefore, showed that the association previously found between ABA accumulation and leaf size was probably largely due to genetic linkage and not to a direct effect of leaf size on ABA accumulation or vice versa. Because of the importance of ABA accumulation in regulating responses of plants to drought stress and the effects of plant size on the rate of development of stress, QTLs for drought-induced ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number were compared between rice and wheat. In particular, a possible location in rice was sought for a homoeologue of the major wheat vernalization responsive gene, Vrn1, as this gene is also associated with major effects on leaf size, tiller number and ABA accumulation in wheat. The likelihood of homoeologous loci regulating ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number in the two crops is discussed.
8980525	Chalcone synthase in rice (Oryza sativa L.): detection of the CHS protein in seedlings and molecular mapping of the chs locus.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The chalcone synthase is a key enzyme that catalyses the first dedicated reaction of the flavonoid pathway in higher plants. The chs gene and its protein product in rice has been investigated. The presence of a chalcone synthase (CHS) protein in rice seedlings and its developmental stage-specific expression has been demonstrated by western analysis. The chalcone synthase of rice was found to be immunologically similar to that of maize. A rice cDNA clone, Os-chs cDNA, encoding chalcone synthase, isolated from a leaf cDNA library of an indica rice variety Purpleputtu has been mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 11 of rice. It was mapped between RFLP markers RG2 and RG103. RG2 is the nearest RFLP marker located at a genetic distance of 3.3 cM. Some segments of chromosome 11 of rice including chs locus are conserved on chromosome 4 of maize. The markers, including chs locus on chromosome 11 of rice are located, though not in the same order, on chromosome 4 of maize. Genetic analysis of purple pigmentation in two rice lines, Abhaya and Shyamala, used in the present mapping studies, indicated the involvement of three genes, one of which has been identified as a dominant inhibitor of leaf pigmentation. The Os-chs cDNA shows extensive sequence homology, both for DNA and protein (deduced), to that of maize, barley and also to different monocots and dicots.
9291971	The molecular basis of disease resistance in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The rice gene Xa21 conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), was isolated using a map-based cloning strategy. Compared with previously cloned genes, the structure of Xa21 represents a novel class of plant disease R genes encoding a putative receptor kinase (RK). This article proposes a model for the mode of action of Xa21 and summarizes our current knowledge of the modular basis of resistance in rice to bacterial leaf blight and blast.
9039499	Construction of YAC contigs on rice chromosome 5.	1996	DNA Res	A physical map of rice chromosome 5 was constructed with yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones along a high-resolution molecular linkage map carrying 118 DNA markers distributed over 123.7 cM of genomic DNA. YAC clones have been identified by colony and Southern hybridization for 105 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for 8 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers and 5 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Of 458 YACs, 235 individual YACs with an average insert length of 350 kb were selected and ordered on chromosome 5 from the YAC library. Forty-eight contigs covering nearly 21 Mb were formed on the chromosome 5; the longest one was 6 cM and covered 1.5 Mb. The length covered with YAC clones corresponded to 62% of the total length, of chromosome 5. There were many multicopy sequences of expressed genes on chromosome 5. The distribution of many copies of these expressed gene sequences was determined by YAC Southern hybridization and is discussed. A physical map with these characteristics provides a powerful tool for elucidation of genome structure and extraction of useful genetic information in rice.
9097042	Assignment of YAC clones spanning rice chromosomes 10 and 12.	1996	DNA Res	Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones were assigned on rice (Oryza saliva L. cv. Nipponbare) chromosomes 10 and 12 using DNA markers from our high-density linkage map. Out of 1,383 markers localized in this genetic map, 68 and 74 markers were located on chromosomes 10 and 12, respectively. Screening of the YAC genomic library was conducted by colony hybridization and Southern hybridization using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. We have completed the screening of 68 markers on chromosomes 10 and 74 markers on chromosome 12. A total of 134 and 103 YACs were assigned to chromosomes 10 and 12, respectively, with an estimated coverage of more than 60% for chromosome 10 and about 47% for chromosome 12. As rice is considered a model plant for genome analysis, the ordered YAC clones on chromosomes 10 and 12 as well as other chromosomes will certainly be helpful for isolation of agronomically and biologically important genes and for understanding the genome structure of these chromosomes.
8122902	Mapping polygenes.	1993	Annu Rev Genet	
8908512	An ordered yeast artificial chromosome library covering over half of rice chromosome 6.	1996	Genome Res	Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones carrying DNA marker sequences located on the rice genetic map of chromosome 6 were ordered for physical mapping. A total of 122 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers, 16 sequence-tagged site markers, and five random amplified polymorphic DNA markers located, on average, at 0.9-cM intervals, were used for YAC clone screening by colony/Southern hybridization and PCR screening, respectively. A total of 216 individual YACs were selected from our YAC library of 7000 clones covering six genome equivalents. Each DNA marker could select, on average, 4.8 YAC clones, with 11 clones being the maximum. The YACs localized to the corresponding linkage map positions form 43 contigs and encompass about 60% of rice chromosome 6. This is the first step in constructing a physical map covering the whole rice genome by chromosome landing with YAC clones. These YACs and data will be used soon to isolate phenotypical trait genes by map-based cloning.
9426599	Repetitive sequences: cause for variation in genome size and chromosome morphology in the genus Oryza.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Large variation in genome size as determined by the nuclear DNA content and the mitotic chromosome size among diploid rice species is revealed using flow cytometry and image analyses. Both the total chromosomal length (r = 0.939) and the total chromosomal area (r = 0.927) correlated well with the nuclear DNA content. Among all the species examined, Oryza australiensis (E genome) and O. brachyantha (F genome), respectively, were the largest and smallest in genome size. O. sativa (A genome) involving all the cultivated species showed the intermediate genome size between them. The distribution patterns of genome-specific repetitive DNA sequences were physically determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). O. brachyantha had limited sites of the repetitive DNA sequences specific to the F genome. O. australiensis showed overall amplification of genome-specific DNA sequences throughout the chromosomes. The amplification of the repetitive DNA sequences causes the variation in the chromosome morphology and thus the genome size among diploid species in the genus Oryza.
7500960	Comparative mapping in grasses. Oat relationships.	1995	Mol Gen Genet	The development of RFLP linkage maps in hexaploid and diploid oat allows us to study genetic relationships of these species at the DNA level. In this report, we present the extension of a previously developed diploid oat map (Avena atlantica x A. hirtula) and its molecular-genetic relationships with wheat, rice and maize. Examination of 92-99% of the length of the oat genome map with probes common to Triticeae species, rice or maize showed that 84, 79 and 71%, respectively, was conserved between these species and oat. Generally, the orders of loci among chromosomes homoelogous to oat chromosomes A and D were the most conserved and those of chromosomes homoeologous to oat chromosome G were the least conserved. Conservation was observed for blocks ranging from whole chromosomes 101 cM long to small segments 2.5 cM long containing two loci. Comparison of the homoeologous segments of Triticeae, rice and maize relative to oat indicated that certain regions have been maintained in all four species. The relative positions of major genes governing traits such as seed storage proteins and resistance to leaf rusts have been conserved between cultivated oat and Triticeae species. Also, the locations of three vernalization/or photoperiod response genes identified in hexaploid oat correspond to the locations of similar genes in homoeologous chromosomes of wheat, rice or maize. The locations of the centromeres for six of the seven oat chromosomes were estimated based on the homoeologous segments between oat and Triticeae chromosomes.
7476878	Comparative mapping in grasses. Wheat relationships.	1995	Mol Gen Genet	Conventionally, the genetics of species of the family Gramineae have been studied separately. Comparative mapping using DNA markers offers a method of combining the research efforts in each species. In this study, we developed consensus maps for members of the Triticeae tribe (Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, and Hordeum spp.) and compared them to rice, maize and oat. The aneuploid stocks available in wheat are invaluable for comparative mapping because almost every DNA fragment can be allocated to a chromosome arm, thus preventing erroneous conclusions about probes that could not be mapped due to a lack of polymorphism between mapping parents. The orders of the markers detected by probes mapped in rice, maize and oat were conserved for 93, 92 and 94% of the length of Triticeae consensus maps, respectively. The chromosome segments duplicated within the maize genome by ancient polyploidization events were identified by homoeology of segments from two maize chromosomes to regions of one Triticeae chromosome. Homoeologous segments conserved across Triticeae species, rice, maize, and oat can be identified for each Triticeae chromosome. Putative orthologous loci for several simply inherited and quantitatively inherited traits in Gramineae species were identified.
7757120	Construction of a rice bacterial artificial chromosome library and identification of clones linked to the Xa-21 disease resistance locus.	1995	Plant J	A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library consisting of 11,000 clones with an average DNA insert size of 125 kb was constructed from rice nuclear DNA. The BAC clones were stable in E. coli after 100 generations of serial growth. Transformation of the BAC clones by electroporation into E. coli was highly efficient and increased with decreasing size of the DNA inserts. The library was evaluated for the presence of organellar, repeated, and telomeric sequences. A very low percentage (< 0.3%) of the library consisted of chloroplast and mitochondrial clones. Eighteen BACs were identified that hybridized with an Arabidopsis telomere repeat. Sixteen BACs hybridized with the AA genome-specific repetitive sequence pOs48. Twelve clones were isolated that hybridized with three DNA markers linked to the Xa-21 disease resistance locus. The results indicate that the BAC system can be used to clone and manipulate large pieces of plant DNA efficiently.
9039498	Physical mapping of rice chromosome 1 with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).	1996	DNA Res	We have constructed a physical map of rice chromosome 1 using yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). A YAC library of 350 kb average insert size, covering about 6 rice haploid genome equivalents, was screened using 182 DNA markers which we had previously located on chromosome 1, by colony hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. One hundred and sixty-two DNA markers identified at least one YAC each carrying one, two or more marker sequences, for a total of 476 clones. Of these identified YACs, 284 were located in their original positions on chromosome 1. These 284 YACs defined 69 YAC contigs or islands which are estimated to cover more than 60% of the total chromosome length. The use of mapped DNA markers in constructing a physical map facilitates the integration of genetic and physical maps, as well as fine ordering of the DNA markers, especially at sites where the markers are clustered tightly on the genetic map. Our high density molecular map has been proven, by chromosome landing with YACs using mapped DNA markers, to cover more than half of the entire length of chromosome 1. The remaining 192 YACs were selected by other copies of DNA markers that mapped on chromosome 1. This description of the YAC contigs formed on chromosome 1 constitutes the second report of rice physical mapping, following that for chromosome 6.
9065686	Chromosomal regions associated with segregation distortion of molecular markers in F2, backcross, doubled haploid, and recombinant inbred populations in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	Mol Gen Genet	Chromosomal regions associated with marker segregation distortion in rice were compared based on six molecular linkage maps. Mapping populations were derived from one interspecific backcross and five inter-subspecific (indica/japonica) crosses, including two F2 populations, two doubled haploid (DH) populations, and one recombinant inbred (RI) population. Mapping data for each population consisted of 129-629 markers. Segregation distortion was determined based on chi-square analysis (P < 0.01) and was observed at 6.8-31.8%, of the mapped marker loci. Marker loci associated with skewed allele frequencies were distributed on all 12 chromosomes. Distortion in eight chromosomal regions bracketed previously identified gametophyte (ga) or sterility genes (S). Distortion in three other chromosomal regions was found only in DH populations, where japonica alleles were over-represented, suggesting that loci in these regions may be associated with preferential regeneration of japonica genotypes during anther culture. Three additional clusters of skewed markers were observed in more than one population in regions where no gametophytic or sterility loci have previously been reported. A total of 17 segregation distortion loci may be postulated based on this study and their locations in the rice genome were estimated.
9291967	Large-scale EST sequencing in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Large-scale cDNA analysis provides several great advantages for genome investigations in rice. Isolated and partially characterized cDNA clones have contributed not only to the construction of an RFLP linkage map and physical maps of the chromosomes but also to investigations of the mechanisms of expression of various isozymes and family genes. The ultimate aim of our large-scale cDNA analysis is to catalogue all the expressed genes of this important cereal, including tissue-specific, developmental stage-specific, and stress-specific genes. As of August 1996, the Rice Genome Research Program (RGP) has isolated and partially sequenced more than 29,000 cDNA clones from various tissues and calluses in rice (Nipponbare, a japonica variety). The sequence data were translated into amino acid sequences for the 3 possible reading frames, and the similarity of these amino acid sequences to known proteins registered in PIR were examined. About 25% of the clones had significant similarities to known proteins. Some of the hit clones showed library-specific distributions, indicating that the composition of the clones in each library reflects, to some extent, the regulation of gene expression specific to differentiation, growth condition, or environmental stress. To further characterize the cDNA clones, including unknown clones, nucleotide sequence similarities of 24,728 clones were analyzed and the clones were classified into around 10,000 independent groups, suggesting that around a half or one third of expressed genes in rice have already been captured. These results obtained from our large-scale cDNA analysis provide useful information related to gene expression and regulation in rice.
9291968	Genetic and molecular dissection of quantitative traits in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Recent progress in the generation of a molecular genetic map and markers for rice has made possible a new phase of mapping individual genes associated with complex traits. This type of analysis is often referred to as quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Increasing numbers of QTL analyses are providing enormous amounts of information about QTLs, such as the numbers of loci involved, their chromosomal locations and gene effects. Clarification of genetic bases of complex traits has a big impact not only on fundamental research on rice plant development, but it also has practical benefits for rice breeding. In this review, we summarize recent progress of QTL analysis of several complex traits in rice. A strategy for positional cloning of genes at QTLs is also discussed.
9291959	Linkage map of phenotype and RFLP markers in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The results from linkage mapping activities at Kyushu University during the last 10 years are summarized in this paper. The present paper concisely reveals present situation on linkage map of phenotype markers, the integration linkage map of phenotype and RFLP markers and the genetic stocks available. Some of the problems in this field, in addition, are pointed out and discussed.
9291965	Physical mapping of the rice genome with BACs.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The development of genetics in this century has been catapulted forward by several milestones: rediscovery of Mendel's laws, determination of DNA as the genetic material, discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA and its implications for genetic behavior, and most recently, analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Each of these milestones has generated a huge wave of progress in genetics. Consequently, our understanding of organismal genetics now extends from phenotypes to their molecular genetic basis. It is now clear that the next wave of progress in genetics will hinge on genome molecular physical mapping, since a genome physical map will provide an invaluable, readily accessible system for many detailed genetic studies and isolation of many genes of economic or biological importance. Recent development of large-DNA fragment (> 100 kb) manipulation and cloning technologies, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning, has provided the powerful tools needed to generate molecular physical maps for higher-organism genomes. This chapter will discuss (1) an ideal physical map of plant genome and its applications in plant genetic and biological studies, (2) reviews on physical mapping of the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and man, (3) large-insert DNA libraries: cosmid, YAC and BAC, and genome physical mapping, (4) physical mapping of the rice genome with BACs, and (5) perspectives on the physical mapping of the rice genome with BACs.
8448360	Phylogenetic distribution and genetic mapping of a (GGC)n microsatellite from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1993	Plant Mol Biol	DNA microsatellites are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic genomes and represent a vast source of highly informative markers. We describe in this article a (GGC)n microsatellite which is widely distributed in eukaryotic genomes. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and DNA sequencing, we demonstrated for the first time in plant species that a (GGC)n microsatellite locus is moderately polymorphic. Six alleles are present at this locus in rice and length polymorphisms are caused by variation in the number of tandem GGC repeats. By scoring a backcross mapping population, we were able to demonstrate that this locus is stably inherited and does not link to any known RFLP markers on the rice RFLP map. Our results suggest that DNA microsatellites should be useful in plants for construction of genetic linkage maps, extension of the existing genetic linkage maps, linkage analysis of disease and pest resistance genes, and the study of population genetics.
11090216	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice.	2000	Plant Cell	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3). In the early vegetative phase, sho mutants show an increased rate of leaf production with random phyllotaxy. The resulting leaves are malformed, threadlike, or short and narrow. Their shoot apical meristems are relatively low and wide, that is, flat shaped, although their shape and size are highly variable among plants of the same genotype. Statistical analysis reveals that the shape of the shoot meristem rather than its size is closely correlated with the variations of plastochron and phyllotaxy. Rapid and random leaf production in sho mutants is correlated with the frequent and disorganized cell divisions in the shoot meristem and with a reduction of expression domain of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1. These changes in the organization and behavior of the shoot apical meristems suggest that sho mutants have fewer indeterminate cells and more determinate cells than wild type, with many cells acting as leaf founder cells. Thus, the SHO genes have an important role in maintaining the proper organization of the shoot apical meristem, which is essential for the normal initiation pattern of leaf primordia.
10555303	Differentially and developmentally regulated expression of three rice sucrose synthase genes.	1999	Plant Cell Physiol	The spatial and temporal distribution of sucrose synthase (RSuS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied by Western and immunohistochemical analyses using the monospecific antibodies for three RSuS isoforms. In leaf tissues, RSuS1 was localized in the mesophyll while RSuS2 was in the phloem in addition to the mesophyll. In the roots, only RSuS1 was found in the phloem. No RSuS3 could be detected in any parts of etiolated seedlings. The expression of each RSus gene is closely linked to the seed development. RSuS1 was present in the aleurone layers of developing seeds, and at a low level in endosperm cells. RSuS2 was evenly distributed in seed tissues other than the endosperm. RSuS3 was localized predominantly in the endosperm cells. The tissue specific localizations of the three gene products suggest that RSuS1 plays a role in sugar transport into endosperm cells where the reaction catalyzed by RSuS3 provides the precursor of starch synthesis. RSus2, which is ubiquitously expressed, may play a housekeeping role.
10805588	Novel mannose-binding rice lectin composed of some isolectins and its relation to a stress-inducible salT gene.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	The novel mannose-binding rice lectin (MRL) purified by Sephadex G-50 or maltamyl Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography was not homogeneous, but the components were separated clearly by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1st; isoelectric focusing with Immobiline, 2nd; SDS-PAGE). The major spots were located at pI 4.85 and 4.74, and minor spots at pI 4.66, 4.56, and 4.44; all spots were distributed at about MW 45,000. Other faint spots were sometimes detected just below the major spots. In the western blot analysis, all the spots reacted with the monoclonal antibodies specific to MRL, which bound to MRL and inhibited the lectin activity to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes. The proteins of the spots at pI 4.85, 4.77, 4.66, and 4.56 had lectin activity. The major proteins at pI 4.85 and 4.77 also had the common amino acid sequence at N-terminus, TLVKIGPWGGNGGSAQDISV, which is almost identical to salt and drought stress-inducible salT gene products in rice plants. High homology was also conserved in both the cDNA and the genomic clones encoding the MRL component at pI 4.85, which were selected with MRL-specific antibodies and an oligonucleotide designed from the partial amino acid sequence. All results suggest that MRL is composed of several isolectins, if not, related proteins having a common epitope and may belong to a family of stress-inducible proteins.
10965945	Antisense waxy genes with highly active promoters effectively suppress waxy gene expression in transgenic rice.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	To regulate Waxy (Wx) gene expression by introducing antisense genes, we connected the 2.3 kb Wx cDNA having 450 bp of the Wx first intron in reverse orientation to rice Wx and maize alcohol dehydrogenase1 (Adh1) promoters and used these constructs to transform rice plants. Of 10 independent transgenic lines analysed, four lines showed various degrees of reduction in amylose and WAXY (WX) protein levels in the endosperm. In two transgenic lines, complete absence of amylose was observed which made the seeds opaque white like glutinous rice (amylose-deficient waxy (wx) mutant). In one of the transgenic lines, A1 line, the presence of the antisense Wx gene cosegregated with reduction of amylose content in the endosperm. In the same line, a reduction in the level of endogenous Wx mRNA was observed in immature endosperm. Interestingly, this reduction was observed only with mature spliced transcripts but not with unspliced transcripts. Reduced amylose synthesis was also observed in pollen grains of four transgenic lines. These results suggest that integrated antisense Wx gene caused a reduction in amylose synthesis in endosperms and pollen grains of transgenic rice carrying the antisense Wx cDNA. These results indicate that manipulation of starch and other carbohydrates in rice grain is possible using antisense genes.
8673344	The seed-specific transcription factor VP1 (OSVP1) is expressed in rice suspension-cultured cells.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	A seed-specific transcriptional regulator, VP1, is required for the induction of ABA-regulated genes that include Lea (late embryogenesis abundant protein) genes. Although the induction of one rice Lea gene, Osem, by ABA is normally restricted to seed tissues, we found that the expression was strongly induced by ABA in the Oc line of rice suspension-cultured cells. Since this observation suggested that rice VP1 (OSVP1) protein or a functionally similar protein might be expressed in the cultured cells, we analyzed the expression of Osvp1 in these cells at both the mRNA and the protein level, we detected Osvp1 mRNA and OSVP1 protein in the cultured cells at levels similar to or higher than those in developing embryos. In the cultured cells, neither the level of total cellular OSVP1 nor that of nuclear OSVP1 protein was affected by ABA. Based on the results, the mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of VP1-dependent ABA-inducible genes is discussed.
11917085	Temporal and spatial expression pattern of the OSVP1 and OSEM genes during seed development in rice.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	The spatial and temporal expression patterns of the rice VP1 (OSVP1) gene, as well as the OSEM gene which it controls, were studied during seed development by in situ hybridization and immuno-localization techniques. The expression of OSVP1 could be detected in embryos as early as 2-3 d after pollination (DAP) and thereafter became preferentially localized to shoot, radicle and vascular tissues during the embryo development at both the mRNA and protein levels. In the aleurone layers, OSVP1 mRNA and protein were detected after 6 DAP. OSEM mRNA was detectable after 6 DAP in the embryo and aleurone tissue. The spatial distribution within the embryo of OSEM mRNA and OSVP1 mRNA/protein was very similar after 6 DAP. Transgenic rice carrying a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene transcribed from a chimeric promoter consisting of the CaMV 35S minimal promoter (-46) and the 55-bp promoter fragment of OSEM, minimally required for ABA and VP1 regulation, also exhibited a spatial pattern of GUS expression similar to that of OSEM and OSVP1. These results suggest that (OS)VP1 is a major determinant not only of the seed specificity but also of the spatial pattern of OSEM expression in the developing seed.
12040096	Isolation of rice genes possibly involved in the photoperiodic control of flowering by a fluorescent differential display method.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the photoperiodic regulation of rice, a short-day plant, we isolated 27 cDNAs that were differentially expressed in the photoperiod-insensitive se5 mutant from approximately 8,400 independent mRNA species by the use of a fluorescent differential display (FDD). For this screening, we isolated mRNAs at five different time points during the night and compared their expression patterns between se5 and the wild type. Of 27 cDNAs isolated, 12 showed diurnal expression patterns often associated with genes involved in the determination of the flowering time. In se5, expression of nine cDNAs was increased. Five of these cDNAs were up-regulated under SD, suggesting that they may promote flowering under SD. They included genes encoding a cDNA containing a putative NAC domain, the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, and a protease inhibitor. Expression of three cDNAs was decreased in se5 but not photoperiodically regulated. These cDNAs included a rice homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI), lir1, and a gene for myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase, all of which were previously shown to be under the control of circadian clocks. The expression patterns of the rice homolog of GI, OsGI, were similar to those of the Arabidopsis GI, suggesting the conservation of some mechanisms for the photoperiodic regulation of flowering between these two species.
12091719	Response of rice to Al stress and identification of quantitative trait Loci for Al tolerance.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) shows the highest tolerance to Al toxicity among small-grain cereal crops, however, the mechanisms and genetics responsible for its high Al tolerance are not yet well understood. We investigated the response of rice to Al stress using the japonica variety Koshihikari in comparison to the indica variety Kasalath. Koshihikari showed higher tolerance at various Al concentrations than Kasalath. The Al content in root apexes was less in Koshihikari than in Kasalath, suggesting that exclusion mechanisms rather than internal detoxification are acting in Koshihikari. Al-induced secretion of citrate was observed in both Koshihikari and Kasalath, however, it is unlikely to be the mechanism for Al tolerance because there was no significant difference in the amount of citrate secreted between Koshihikari and Kasalath. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al tolerance were mapped in a population of 183 backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross of Koshihikari and Kasalath. Three putative QTLs controlling Al tolerance were detected on chromosomes 1, 2 and 6. Kasalath QTL alleles on chromosome 1 and 2 reduced Al tolerance but increased tolerance on chromosome 6. The three QTLs explained about 27% of the phenotypic variation in Al tolerance. The existence of QTLs for Al tolerance was confirmed in substitution lines for corresponding chromosomal segments.
12354914	The slender rice mutant, with constitutively activated gibberellin signal transduction, has enhanced capacity for abscisic acid level.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	The slender rice (slr1-1) mutant, carrying a lethal and recessive single mutation, has a constitutive gibberellin (GA)-response phenotype and behaves as if it were saturated with GAs [Ikeda et al. (2001) Plant Cell 13, 999]. The SLR1 gene, with sequence homology to members of the plant-specific GRAS gene family, is a mediator of the GA signal transduction process. In the slender rice, GA-inducible alpha-amylase was produced from the aleurone layer without applying GA. GA-independent alpha-amylase production in the mutant was inhibited by applying abscisic acid (ABA). Shoot elongation in the mutant was also suppressed by ABA, indicating that the slender rice responds normally to ABA. Interestingly, shoot ABA content was 10-fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type, while there was no difference in root ABA content. Expression of the Rab16A gene, which is known to be ABA inducible, was about 10-fold higher in shoots of the mutant than in those of the wild type. These results indicate that constitutive activation of the GA signal transduction pathway by the slr1-1 mutation promotes the endogenous ABA level.
12668770	Photomorphogenesis of rice seedlings: a mutant impaired in phytochrome-mediated inhibition of coleoptile growth.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	A mutant showing a long coleoptile phenotype under white light was isolated from gamma-ray-mutagenized rice (cv. Nihonmasari). This mutant, named cpm1 (coleoptile photomorphogenesis 1), has been found to be impaired in phytochrome-mediated inhibition of coleoptile growth. Another outstanding feature of the mutant is impaired anthesis. Under red light (R), cpm1 coleoptiles elongate at a higher rate than wild-type (WT) coleoptiles, owing to substantially reduced responsiveness to R. This phenotype occurs in an age-dependent manner, and cpm1 coleoptiles become responsive to R as they elongate. The impairment was found in both very-low-fluence and low-fluence responses. Mutant coleoptiles also elongate longer than WT coleoptiles in darkness, but in this case the long coleoptile results from an extended elongation period. The cpm1 mutation does not affect the following phytochrome responses: the growth stimulation in submerged coleoptiles (uncovered in this study), potentiation of greening, and down-regulation of PHYA transcription. The cpm1 mutation does not significantly affect the level of spectroscopically detectable phytochrome and the transcription levels of three phytochrome genes (PHYA-C). It is concluded that the CPM1 gene is involved in the phytochrome signal transduction that specifically leads to growth inhibition. Some aspects of rice seedling photomorphogenesis are discussed in relation to the results obtained.
11828031	Ectopic expression of OsMADS3, a rice ortholog of AGAMOUS, caused a homeotic transformation of lodicules to stamens in transgenic rice plants.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	In order to clarify the evolutionary relationship of floral organs between grasses and dicots, we expressed OsMADS3, a rice (Oryza sativa L.) AGAMOUS(AG) ortholog, in rice plants under the control of an Actin1 promoter. As a consequence of the ectopic expression of the OsMADS3, lodicules were homeotically transformed into stamens. In total, the transformation of lodicules to staminoid organs was observed in 18 out of 26 independent transgenic lines. In contrast to the almost complete transformation occurring in lodicules, none of the transgenic plants exhibited any morphological alterations in the palea or the lemma. Our results confirmed the prediction that the lodicule is an equivalent of a dicot petal and that the ABC model can be applied to rice at least for organ specification in lodicules and stamens.
12881500	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined. OsAMT1s belong to AMT1 family, containing 11 putative transmembrane-spanning domains. Southern blot analysis and screening of the rice genome database confirmed that with OsAMT1;1-1;3 the complete AMT1 family of rice had been isolated. Heterologous expression of OsAMT1s in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant 31019b showed that all three OsAMT1s exhibit ammonium transport activity. Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3. In situ mRNA detection revealed that OsAMT1;2 is expressed in the central cylinder and cell surface of root tips. This gene expression analysis revealed a distinct nitrogen-dependent regulation for AMTs in rice, differing from that in tomato or Arabidopsis:
10655238	Identification of heading date quantitative trait locus Hd6 and characterization of its epistatic interactions with Hd2 in rice using advanced backcross progeny.	2000	Genetics	A backcrossed population (BC(4)F(2)) derived from a cross between a japonica rice variety, Nipponbare, as the recurrent parent and an indica rice variety, Kasalath, as the donor parent showed a long-range variation in days to heading. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed that two QTL, one on chromosome 3, designated Hd6, and another on chromosome 2, designated Hd7, were involved in this variation; and Hd6 was precisely mapped as a single Mendelian factor by using progeny testing (BC(4)F(3)). The nearly isogenic line with QTL (QTL-NIL) that carries the chromosomal segment from Kasalath for the Hd6 region in Nipponbare's genetic background was developed by marker-assisted selection. In a day-length treatment test, the QTL-NIL for Hd6 prominently increased days to heading under a 13.5-hr day length compared with the recurrent parent, Nipponbare, suggesting that Hd6 controls photoperiod sensitivity. QTL analysis of the F(2) population derived from a cross between the QTL-NILs revealed existence of an epistatic interaction between Hd2, which is one of the photoperiod sensitivity genes detected in a previous analysis, and Hd6. The day-length treatment tests of these QTL-NILs, including the line introgressing both Hd2 and Hd6, also indicated an epistatic interaction for photoperiod sensitivity between them.
12558863	Lobular capillary hemangioma of the oral mucosa: clinicopathological study of 43 cases with a special reference to immunohistochemical characterization of the vascular elements.	2003	Pathol Int	Clinical and histopathological features were investigated in 43 cases of oral lobular capillary hemangiomas (LCH) with a special reference to characteristics of the vascular elements. The lesions affected females more than males by a ratio of 1:1.5. Average age of the patients was 52.7 years. The lesions involved the gingiva (n = 15), the tongue (n = 13), the labial mucosa (n = 10) and other sites. The lesions appeared usually as a pedunculated mass with ulceration; size of the lesions was up to 15 mm. Histologically, a lobular area and an ulcerative area were distinguished. The density of vessels was about 1045/mm2 and 160/mm2 in the lobular and ulcerative areas, respectively. The average diameter of the vascular lumen was 9.1 5.6 mm (range: 2.8-42.0 mm) and 18.8 20.9 mm (range: 5.6-139.7 mm) in the lobular and ulcerative areas, respectively. In the lobular area, most of the vessels had an inner layer of endothelial cells showing positive reaction for von Willebrand factor (vWF) and CD34, as well as an outer layer of mesenchymal cells showing positive reaction for alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA). However, in the ulcerative area, there was a variety of types of vessels consisting of various proportions of both endothelial and ASMA-positive perivascular mesenchymal cells. These results indicate that most of the vascular elements in the lobular area resemble more pericapillary microvascular segments than they do capillaries. Thus, the authors propose the term 'lobular pericapillary hemangioma' to represent this type of lesion.
7915844	Using bulked extremes and recessive class to map genes for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility in rice.	1994	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PS-GMS) rice has a number of desirable characteristics for hybrid rice production. In this study we made use of a published rice genetic linkage map to determine the locations of PSGMS genes and we have characterized the effects of these genes on sterility by using molecular markers. A two-step approach was designed for mapping the genes: (i) identifying possible PSGMS gene-containing chromosome regions with bulked DNA from extreme fertile and extreme sterile plants of a very large F2 population and (ii) determining the map locations of the genes in extreme sterile individuals. We show that this mapping method is much more cost effective and statistically efficient than using a random sample of an F2 population. We identified two chromosomal regions each containing a PSGMS locus, one designated pms1 on chromosome 7 and one designated pms2 on chromosome 3. The existence of these two loci was confirmed by a large sample assay and with data on rationing progenies of the F2 plants. A marker-based analysis shows that the effect of pms1 is 2-3 times larger than that of pms2 and that dominance is almost complete at both loci. Implications in the breeding of PSGMS rice lines are discussed.
4771843	A gel consistency test for eating quality of rice.	1973	J Sci Food Agric	
12582666	Identification of quantitative trait loci and epistatic interactions for plant height and heading date in rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Appropriate heading date and plant height are prerequisites for attaining the desired yield level in rice breeding programs. In this study, we analyzed the genetic bases of heading date and plant height at both single- locus and two-locus levels, using a population of 240 F(2:3) families derived from a cross between two elite rice lines. Measurements for the traits were obtained over 2 years in replicated field trials. A linkage map was constructed with 151 polymorphic marker loci, based on which interval mapping was performed using Mapmaker/QTL. The analyses detected six QTLs for plant height and six QTLs for heading date; collectively the QTLs for heading date accounted for a much greater amount of phenotypic variation than did the QTLs for plant height. Two-way analyses of variance, with all possible two-locus combinations, detected large numbers (from 101 to 257) of significant digenic interactions in the 2 years for both traits involving markers distributed in the entire genome; 22 and 39 were simultaneously detected in both years for plant height and heading date, respectively. Each of the interactions individually accounted for only a very small portion of the phenotypic variation. The majority of the significant interactions involved marker loci that did not detect significant effects by single-locus analyses, and many of the QTLs detected by single-locus analyses were involved in epistatic interactions. The results clearly demonstrated the importance of epistatic interactions in the genetic bases of heading date and plant height.
12579422	Mapping of a gene responsible for the difference in amylopectin structure between japonica-type and indica-type rice varieties.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	The present investigation revealed that the alk and gel(t) genes, which cause the differences between a japonica rice variety Nipponbare and an indica rice variety Kasalath in terms of the disintegration of endosperm starch granules in alkali solution and their gelatinisation in a 4 M urea solution, respectively, cosegregated in backcross inbred lines derived from a cross between the two varieties. The segregation pattern of the profile for amylopectin chain-length, which was distinguished by enrichment in short chains of DP<==11 and depletion in intermediate-size chains of 12<==DP<==24 in japonica as compared with indica, was exactly the same as those of the above physico-chemical properties of starch granules, and the gene was designated as acl(t). Gene-mapping analysis showed that the starch synthase IIa ( SSIIa) gene is located at the alk locus on chromosome 6 in the rice genome. These results lead us to the possibility that different alleles of the SSIIa gene are responsible for differences in amylopectin structure between the two varieties, in that SSIIa plays a distinct role in the elongation of short chains within clusters (A+B(1) chains) of amylopectin. It is proposed that the activity of SSIIa in japonica rice is reduced in amount or functional capacity relative to the activity of this enzyme in indica rice. This, in turn, would explain why starch from japonica rice has a lower gelatinisation temperature than starch from indica rice and is more susceptible to disintegration in alkali or urea. The evidence for this hypothesis is that the alk(t), gel(t), acl(t) and SSIIa genes all map to the same locus.
12582694	RFLP-facilitated investigation of the quantitative resistance of rice to brown planthopper ( Nilaparvata lugens).	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Quantitative trait loci (QTLs), conferring quantitative resistance to rice brown planthopper (BPH), were investigated using 160 F(11) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the Lemont/Teqing cross, a complete RFLP map, and replicated phenotyping of seedbox inoculation. The paternal indica parent, Teqing, was more-resistant to BPH than the maternal japonica parent, Lemont. The RILs showed transgressive segregation for resistance to BPH. Seven main-effect QTLs and many epistatic QTL pairs were identified and mapped on the 12 rice chromosomes. Collectively, the main-effect and epistatic QTLs accounted for over 70% of the total variation in damage scores. Teqing has the resistance allele at four main-effect QTLs, and the Lemont allele resulted in resistance at the other three. Of the main-effect QTLs identified, QBphr5b was mapped to the vicinity of gl1, a major gene controlling leaf and stem pubescence. The Teqing allele controlling leaf and stem pubescence was associated with resistance, while the Lemont allele for glabrous stem and leaves was associated with susceptibility, indicating that this gene may have contributed to resistance through antixenosis. Similar to the reported BPH resistance genes, the other six detected main-effect QTLs were all mapped to regions where major disease resistance genes locate, suggesting they might have contributed either to antibiosis or tolerance. Our results indicated that marker-aided pyramiding of major resistance genes and QTLs should provide effective and stable control over this devastating pest.
12582654	Isolation, characterization, and mapping of the stay green mutant in rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Leaf color turns yellow during senescence due to the degradation of chlorophylls and photosynthetic proteins. A stay green mutant was isolated from the glutinous japonica rice Hwacheong- wx through N-methyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Leaves of the mutant remained green, while turning yellow in those of the wild-type rice during senescence. The stay green phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene, tentatively symbolized as sgr(t). All the phenotypic characteristics of the mutant were the same as those of the wild-type lines except for the stay green trait. The leaf chlorophyll concentration of the mutant was similar to that of the wild-type before heading, but decreased steeply in the wild-type during grain filling, while very slowly in the mutant. However, no difference in photosynthetic activity was observed between the stay green mutant and the yellowing wild-type leaves, indicating that senescence is proceeding normally in the mutant leaves and that the mutation affects the rate of chlorophyll degradation during the leaf senescence. Using phenotypic and molecular markers, we mapped the sgr(t) locus to the long arm of chromosome 9 between RFLP markers RG662 and C985 at 1.8- and 2.1-cM intervals, respectively.
12582636	Genetic dissection of a genomic region for a quantitative trait locus, Hd3, into two loci, Hd3a and Hd3b, controlling heading date in rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	The rice photoperiod sensitivity gene Hd3 was originally detected as a heading date-related quantitative trait locus localized on chromosome 6 of rice. High-resolution linkage mapping of Hd3 was performed using a large segregating population derived from advanced backcross progeny between a japonica variety, Nipponbare, and an indica variety, Kasalath. To determine the genotype of Hd3, we employed progeny testing under natural field and short-day conditions. As a result, two tightly linked loci, Hd3a and Hd3b, were identified in the Hd3 region. Nearly-isogenic lines for Hd3a and Hd3b were selected from progeny using marker-assisted selection. The inheritance mode of both Hd3a and Hd3b was found to be additive. Analysis of daylength response in nearly-isogenic lines of Hd3a and Hd3b showed that the Kasalath allele at Hd3a promotes heading under short-day conditions while that at Hd3b causes late heading under long-day and natural field conditions.
12582603	Mapping quantitative trait loci controlling seed longevity in rice ( Oryza sativa L.).	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed longevity in rice were identified using 98 backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between a japonica variety Nipponbare and an indica variety Kasalath. Seeds of each BIL were kept for 12 months at 30 degrees C in dry conditions to promote loss of viability. To measure seed longevity, we performed an additional aging-processing treatment for 2 months at 30 degrees C maintaining seeds at 15% moisture content. We measured the germination percent of these treated seeds at 25 degrees C for 7 days as the degree of seed longevity. The germination of BILs ranged from 0 to 100% with continuous variation. Three putative QTLs for seed longevity, qLG-2, qLG-4 and qLG-9, were detected on chromosome 2, 4 and 9, respectively. Kasalath alleles increased the seed longevity at these QTLs. The QTL with the largest effect, qLG-9, explained 59.5% of total phenotypic variation in BILs. The other two QTLs, qLG-2 and qLG-4, explained 13.4 and 11.6% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. We also verified the effect of the Kasalath allele of qLG-9 using chromosome segment substitution lines. Furthermore, QTLs for seed dormancy were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 11. Based on the comparison of the chromosomal location of QTLs for seed longevity and seed dormancy, these traits seem to be controlled by different genetic factors.
12582557	A bentazon and sulfonylurea sensitive mutant: breeding, genetics and potential application in seed production of hybrid rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	The use of a thermosensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) system in two-line hybrid rice breeding is affected greatly by the sterility instability of TGMS lines caused by temperature fluctuation beyond their critical temperatures for fertility reversion. To prevent seed production from self contamination, we have developed a system to secure seed purity using a herbicide-sensitive TGMS mutant, M8077S, obtained by radiation. Genetic analysis, using the F(1), F(2) and F(3) populations derived from this mutant and other normal varieties, revealed that bentazon lethality/sensitivity was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was named bel. The mutant can be killed at the seedling stage by bentazon at 300 mg/l or higher, a dosage that is safe for its F(1) hybrids and all other normal varieties. This mutant is also sensitive to all the tested sulfonylurea herbicides. Response of segregating plants to these two types of herbicide indicated that sulfonylurea sensitivity was also controlled by bel. By crossing this mutant with Pei-Ai 64S, an F(2) population was developed for genetic mapping. Surveying the two DNA pools from sensitive and non-sensitive F(2) plants identified four markers that were polymorphic between the pools. The putative linked markers were then confirmed with the F(2) population. The bel locus was located on chromosome 3, 7.1 cM from the closest microsatellite marker RM168. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the bel gene had no negative effect on agronomic traits in either a homozygous or heterozygous status. The mutant M8077S is valuable in the development of a TGMS breeding system for preventing impurity resulting from temperature fluctuation of the TGMS. Several two-line hybrid rice crosses using this system are under development.
12582477	A genetic and physical map of the region containing PLASTOCHRON1, a heterochronic gene, in rice ( Oryza sativa L.).	2002	Theor Appl Genet	The rice heterochronic gene plastochron1, pla1, shows shorter plastochron and ectopic expression of the vegetative program during the rice reproductive phase resulting in aberrant panicle formation. A genetic and physical map was constructed to isolate the causal gene for the pla1 syndrome. Small-scale mapping was carried out to determine the approximate map position of the pla1 locus, and then a high-resolution genetic map was made for pla1-1, one of the pla1 alleles, using an F(2) population comprising 578 pla1-1 homozygous plants. In a high-resolution genetic map, the pla1-1 locus was found to map between RFLP markers C961 and R1738A on chromosome 10, within a 3.6-cM genetic distance. A physical map encompassing the pla1-1 locus was constructed by overlapping Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones through chromosome walking. PCR-based RFLP markers from BAC-end clones were developed and mapped relative to the pla1 locus. Physical map construction using BAC clones indicated that a BAC clone, B44A10 (167-kb), contained the pla1 locus within 74-kb corresponding to a 0.52-cM genetic distance. Gene prediction of 74-kb region carrying the pla1 locus suggested several candidate genes for the pla1 gene. Identification of a candidate gene for pla1 will be made by sequence analysis of allele variation and cDNA screening.
12582482	Identification and mapping of an AFLP marker linked to Gm7, a gall midge resistance gene and its conversion to a SCAR marker for its utility in marker aided selection in rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	We have identified an AFLP marker SA598 that is linked to Gm7, a gene conferring resistance to biotypes 1, 2 and 4 of the gall midge ( Orseolia oryzae), a major dipteran pest of rice. A set of PCR primers specific to an RFLP marker, previously identified to be linked to another gall midge resistance gene Gm2, also amplified a 1.5-kb (F8LB) fragment that is linked to Gm7. Gm7 is a dominant gene and non-allelic to Gm2. Hybridization experiments with clones from a YAC library of Nipponbare, a japonica variety, a BAC library of IR-BB21, an indica variety, and cosmid clones encompassing Gm2 from Phalguna, an indica variety, with F8LB and SA598 as probes, revealed that Gm7 is tightly linked to Gm2 and is located on chromosome 4 of rice. SA598 was sequenced and the sequence information was used to design sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers. The potential use of these SCAR primers in marker-aided selection of Gm7 in a rice breeding program has been demonstrated.
12582488	Molecular dissection of seedling-vigor and associated physiological traits in rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	seedling-vigor is important for crop establishment. There have been reported quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses on seedling-vigor related morphological traits. However, physiological understanding of these detected QTLs is rather limited. In this study, we employed a recombinant inbred population to detect QTLs for seedling-vigor traits and physiological traits related to seedling-vigor. Germination rate and seedling growth were measured to quantify seedling-vigor. Total amylase activity, alpha-amylase activity, reducing sugar content, root activity and seed weight were determined. Correlations were observed between the seedling-vigor and physiological traits. QTL analysis reveals that the intervals of RG393-C1087-RZ403 on chromosome 3, C246-RM26-C1447 and R830-R3166-RG360-C734b on chromosome 5, and the interval of Waxy on chromosome 6 are the four main chromosomal regions controlling seedling-vigor. Several QTLs for amylase activities, reducing sugar content and root activity were localized in the similar regions as the QTLs for seedling-vigor. The results suggest that these traits were under the control of pleiotropic and/or closely linked QTLs. The implications of the results in the understanding of the physiological basis of seedling-vigor were discussed.
12582916	Genetic basis of hybrid breakdown in a Japonica/Indica cross of rice, Oryza sativa L.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Reproductive barriers often arise in hybrid progeny between two varietal groups of Asian cultivated rice ( Oryza sativa L.), Japonica and Indica. Hybrid breakdown showing poor growth habit, and complete sterility was found in the backcrossed progeny derived from a cross between a Japonica variety, Asominori, and an Indica variety, IR24. We employed RFLP analysis in the segregating population to study the genetic basis underlying hybrid breakdown. It was found that the hybrid breakdown is caused by a set of two nuclear genes, which were symbolized as hwe1 and hwe2. The parental varieties, Asominori and IR24, carry hwe1(+) hwe1(+) hwe2hwe2 and hwe1hwe1hwe2(+) hwe2(+) genotypes, respectively, whereas the progenies that showed a weakness performance carry the double recessive genotype ( hwe1hwe1hwe2hwe2). Abnormality was not observed in the progenies that carry the other genotypes, indicating that a single dominant allele at either locus is necessary for normal growth. Based on linkage analysis with RFLP markers, the hwe1 locus was located between RFLP markers R1869 and S1437 on chromosome 12 and the hwe2 locus was located between R3192 and C1211 on chromosome 1. The genetic basis was reconfirmed using near-isogenic lines carrying the genes with reciprocal genetic backgrounds. The present study provides clear evidence, viewed by previous workers, that hybrid breakdown is attributed to complementary genes from both parents.
12582891	Analysis on additive effects and additive-by-additive epistatic effects of QTLs for yield traits in a recombinant inbred line population of rice.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	A linkage map consisting of 158 DNA markers were constructed by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the indica-indica rice cross Zhenshan 97B x Milyang 46. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conditioning grain yield and five yield component traits were determined at the one-locus and two-locus levels, and genotype-by-environment (GE) interactions were analyzed. Thirty-one QTLs were detected to have significant additive effects for yield traits, of which 12 also exhibited significant epistatic effects. Sixteen significant additive-by-additive (AA) interactions were detected, of which nine occurred between QTLs with own additive effects (M(ep)QTLs), four occurred between QTLs showing epistatic effects only (epQTLs), and three occurred between M(ep)QTLs and epQTLs. Significant GE interactions were found for six QTLs with additive effects and one AA interaction. Generally, the contributions to the phenotypic variation were higher due to QTL main effects than to epistatic effects. The detection of additive effects and AA effects of a QTL interfered with each other, indicating that the detection of QTLs with main effects, as well as the magnitude and directions of the additive effects, might vary depending on their interactions with other loci.
12582854	Tagging and mapping of rice sheath blight resistant gene.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani Kühn) is one of the severe rice diseases worldwide. In this study, an F(2) population from a cross between "4011" and "Xiangzaoxian19" is used to identify molecular markers linked with the resistant trait. "4011" was a transgenic rice cultivar carrying a resistant gene to sheath blight, while "Xiangzaoxian19" is a highly susceptible one. As a result, five molecular markers, including three RFLP markers converted from RAPD and AFLP markers, and two SSR markers were identified to link with the sheath blight resistant gene. This dominant resistant gene was named as R sb 1 and mapped on rice chromosome 5. The linkage distance between the markers (E-AT:M-CAC(120), E-AT:M-CTA(230), OPN-16(2000), RM164(320) and RM39(300)) and R sb 1 was 1.6 cM, 9.9 cM, 1.6 cM, 15.2 cM and 1.6 cM, respectively.
12595985	Identification and mapping of the QTL for aluminum tolerance introgressed from the new source, Oryza Rufipogon Griff., into indica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2003	Theor Appl Genet	This study was conducted to identify and map the quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling Al tolerance in rice using molecular markers. A population of 171 F(6) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Oryza sativa (IR64), the Al susceptible parent, and Oryza rufipogon, the Al tolerant parent, was evaluated for Al tolerance using a nutrient solution with and without 40 ppm of active Al(+3). A genetic map, consisting of 151 molecular markers covering 1,755 cM with an average distance of 11.6 cM between loci, was constructed. Nine QTLs were dentified including one for root length under non-stress conditions (CRL), three for root length under Al stress (SRL) and five for relative root length (RRL). O. rufipogon contributed favorable alleles for each of the five QTLs for RRL, which is a primary parameter for Al tolerance, and individually they explained 9.0-24.9% of the phenotypic variation. Epistatic analysis revealed that CRL was conditioned by an epistatic effect, whereas SRL and RRL were controlled by additive effects. Comparative genetic analysis showed that QTLs for RRL, which mapped on chromosomes 1 and 9, appear to be consistent among different rice populations. Interestingly, a major QTL for RRL, which explained 24.9% of the phenotypic variation, was found on chromosome 3 of rice, which is conserved across cereal species. These results indicate the possibilities to use marker-assisted selection and pyramiding QTLs for enhancing Al tolerance in rice. Positional cloning of such QTLs introgressed from O. rufipogon will provide a better understanding of the Al tolerance mechanism in rice and the evolutionary genetics of plant adaptation to acid-soil conditions across cereal species.
12647052	Identification of five new blast resistance genes in the highly blast-resistant rice variety IR64 using a QTL mapping strategy.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Rice progenies used for the construction of genetic maps permit exhaustive identification and characterization of resistance genes present in their parental cultivars. We inoculated a rice progeny derived from the cross IR64 x Azucena with different Magnaporthe grisea isolates that showed differential responses on the parental cultivars. By QTL mapping, nine unlinked loci conferring resistance to each isolate were identified and named Pi-24( t) to Pi-32( t). They could correspond to nine specific resistance genes. Five of these resistance loci (RLs) were mapped at chromosomal locations where no resistance gene was previously reported, defining new resistance genes. Using degenerate primers of the NBS (nucleotide binding site) motif found in many resistance genes, two resistance gene analogues (RGAs) IR86 and IR14 were identified and mapped closely to two blast RLs (resistance identified in this study, i.e. Pi-29(t) and Pi-30(t) respectively). These two RLs may correspond to the Pi-11 and Pi-a blast resistance genes previously identified. Moreover, the ir86 and ir14 genes have been identified "in silico" on the indica rice cultivar 93-11, recently sequenced by Chinese researchers. Both genes encodes NBS-LRR-like proteins that are characteristics of plant-disease resistance genes.
12671757	QTLs conferring cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice using recombinant inbred lines from a japonica x indica cross.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Low temperature stress is common for rice grown in temperate regions and at high elevations in the tropics. The most senstive stage to this stress is booting, about 11 days before heading. Japonica cultivars are known to be more tolerant than indicas. We constructed a genetic map using 191 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a temperate japonica, M-202, and a tropical indica, IR50, in order to locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring cold tolerance. The map with a total length of 1,276.8 cM and an average density of one marker every 7.1 cM was developed from 181 loci produced by 175 microsatellite markers. Cold tolerance was measured as the degree of spikelet sterility of treated plants at a 12 degrees C temperature for 5 days in the growth chamber. QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 were identified to confer cold tolerance at the booting stage. The QTL contribution to the phenotypic variation ranged from 11 to 17%. The two QTLs with the highest contribution to variation, designated qCTB2a and qCTB3, were derived from the tolerant parent, M-202, each explaining approximately 17% of the phenotypic variance. Two of the eight QTLs for cold tolerance were contributed by IR50.
12595998	Identification of a 47-kb DNA fragment containing Xa4, a locus for bacterial blight resistance in rice.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae is a devastating disease in rice worldwide. The resistance gene Xa4 has been widely used in breeding programs and played an important role in protecting rice from this disease. Using 642 highly susceptible individuals and a random sample of 255 individuals from an F(2) population developed from a cross between IRBB4 and IR24, the Xa4 gene was genetically mapped to a region less than 1 cM. A contig map was constructed for the Xa4 region consisting of six non-redundant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and spanning approximately 500 kb in length. Analysis of recombination events in the Xa4 region located the gene locus to one BAC, 3H8. Assay of the recombinants using the subclones of 3H8 in combination with sequence analysis further narrowed the Xa4 locus down to a 47-kb fragment.
12750790	Genetic and physical mapping of a new gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	The inheritance of resistance for bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo), was studied in Minghui 63, an elite restorer line for a number of widely used rice hybrids in China. A new dominant gene against a Chinese Xoo strain JL691 in both the seedling and adult stages was identified in Minghui 63 and designated as Xa26( t). Using a total of 477 highly susceptible individuals from an F(2) population, the Xa26( t) locus was mapped to a region of about 1.68 cM. This locus co-segregated with marker R1506 and was 0.21 cM from marker RM224 on one side and 1.47 cM from marker Y6855RA on the other side, in rice chromosome 11. A contig map, composed of five non-redundant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and spanning approximately 500 kb in length, was constructed. Analysis of recombination events in the Xa26( t) region with the highly susceptible F(2) individuals anchored the gene locus to a region covered by three overlapped BAC clones. Assay of the lines showing a double crossover in marker loci flanking Xa26( t), in a population of recombinant inbred lines carrying Xa26( t), further delineated the gene to a 20-kb fragment. The Xa26( t) locus is tightly linked to another bacterial blight resistance gene locus, Xa4.
12835929	Biochemical and molecular characterization of a rice glutelin allele for the GluA-1 gene.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	The rice ( Oryza sativa L.) mutant of glu4a, lacking the glutelin alpha-2 subunit while the alpha-1 subunit increased (alpha-1H/alpha-2L), was used in this study. Two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis revealed that the mutant lacked the polypeptide pI6.71/alpha-2 encoded by glu4 while forming a new polypeptide of pI6.50/alpha-1. Experiments were conducted to identify the relationships between the mutated polypeptides of the mutant and to illustrate the mutation mechanism of the allele. Peptide mapping and amino-acid sequence analyses revealed that the newly formed glu4a encoded polypeptide pI6.50/alpha-1 of high homology with the deleted pI6.71/alpha-2 polypeptide which was encoded by glu4 (GluA-1). The nucleotide sequence revealed that the iso-electric point variation of the pI6.50/alpha-1 polypeptide was caused by a point mutation with nucleotide replacement at the variable region of the gene. These results suggested the possibility of altering glutelin quality by using single gene mutation.
12721635	Gene actions of QTLs affecting several agronomic traits resolved in a recombinant inbred rice population and two testcross populations.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	To understand the types of gene action controlling seven quantitative traits in rice, QTL mapping was performed to dissect the main effect (M-QTLs) and digenic epistatic (E-QTLs) QTLs responsible for the trait performance of 254 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of "Lemont/Teqing", and two testcross (TC) F(1) populations derived from these RILs. The correlation analyses reveal a general pattern, i.e. trait heritability in the RILs was negatively correlated to trait heterosis in the TC hybrids. A large number of M-QTLs and E-QTLs affecting seven traits, including heading date (HD), plant height (PH), flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), panicle length (PL), spikelet number per panicle (SN) and spikelet fertility (SF), were identified and could be classified into two predominant groups, additive QTLs detected primarily in the RILs, and overdominant QTLs identified exclusively in the TC populations. There is little overlap between QTLs identified in the RILs and in the TC populations. This result implied that additive gene action is largely independent from non-additive gene action in the genetic control of quantitative traits of rice. The detected E-QTLs collectively explained a much greater portion of the total phenotypic variation than the M-QTLs, supporting prior findings that epistasis has played an important role in the genetic control of quantitative traits in rice. The implications of these results to the development of inbred and hybrid cultivars were discussed.
12736777	Mapping quantitative trait loci for yield, yield components and morphological traits in an advanced backcross population between Oryza rufipogon and the Oryza sativa cultivar Jefferson.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	An advanced backcross population between an accession of Oryza rufipogon (IRGC 105491) and the U.S. cultivar Jefferson (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) was developed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield, yield components and morphological traits. The genetic linkage map generated for this population consisted of 153 SSR and RFLP markers with an average interval size of 10.3 cM. Thirteen traits were examined, nine of which were measured in multiple environments. Seventy-six QTLs above an experiment-wise significance threshold of P<0.01 (corresponding to an interval mapping LOD>3.6 or a composite interval mapping LOD>3.9) were identified. For the traits measured in multiple environments, 47% of the QTLs were detected in at least two environments. The O. rufipogon allele was favorable for 53% of the yield and yield component QTLs, including loci for yield, grains per panicle, panicle length, and grain weight. Morphological traits related to the domestication process and/or weedy characteristics, including plant height, shattering, tiller type and awns, were found clustered on chromosomes 1 and 4. Comparisons to previous studies involving wild x cultivated crosses revealed O. rufipogon alleles with stable effects in multiple genetic backgrounds and environments, several of which have not been detected in studies between Oryza sativa cultivars, indicating potentially novel alleles from O. rufipogon. Some O. rufipogon-derived QTLs, however, were in similar regions as previously reported QTLs from Oryza sativa cultivars, providing evidence for conservation of these QTLs across the Oryza genus. In addition, several QTLs for grain weight, plant height, and flowering time were localized to putative homeologous regions in maize where QTLs for these traits have been previously reported, supporting the hypothesis of functional conservation of QTLs across the grasses.
12734656	Mutation detection in rice waxy mutants by PCR-RF-SSCP.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	PCR-RF-SSCP (PRS), which combines cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), is expected to be a useful technique for DNA polymorphism analysis. We evaluated the ability of PRS to detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using the Waxy gene, Wx, of rice, and subsequently were able to identify point mutations in wx mutant lines. The approximately 6-kb Wx gene was divided into five regions for PCR amplification. Two regions, in which most of the point mutations of the wx mutants have been identified, were amplified by PCR and cloned into a vector, and those clones containing SNPs produced as a result of the inherent inaccuracy of PCR were used for the evaluation of PRS. The efficiency of PRS in the detection of SNPs of these clones was over 70%. PRS analysis of the wx genes in 18 waxy mutants was carried out in the five regions using two different restriction endonucleases and two gel conditions, with and without glycerol. Of the 18 lines tested, 17 showed band patterns different from that of the wild type. Most of the mutations identified in this study were nucleotide changes in exons, which result in amino acid changes. One mutation generated an in-frame stop codon, and another was a frame shift mutation by one-base deletion. Two mutations found at a splice site were considered to inhibit normal splicing of mRNA. These results show that PRS is a useful technique for detecting point mutations in large plant genes.
12920521	Identification of QTL for growth- and grain yield-related traits in rice across nine locations of Asia.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Rice double-haploid (DH) lines of an indica and japonica cross were grown at nine different locations across four countries in Asia. Genotype-by-environment (G x E) interaction analysis for 11 growth- and grain yield-related traits in nine locations was estimated by AMMI analysis. Maximum G x E interaction was exhibited for fertility percentage number of spikelets and grain yield. Plant height was least affected by environment, and the AMMI model explained a total of 76.2% of the interaction effect. Mean environment was computed by averaging the nine environments and subsequently analyzed with other environments to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). QTL controlling the 11 traits were detected by interval analysis using mapmaker/qtl. A threshold LOD of >/=3.20 was used to identify significant QTL. A total of 126 QTL were identified for the 11 traits across nine locations. Thirty-four QTL common in more than one environment were identified on ten chromosomes. A maximum of 44 QTL were detected for panicle length, and the maximum number of common QTL were detected for days to heading detected. A single locus for plant height (RZ730-RG810) had QTL common in all ten environments, confirming AMMI results that QTL for plant height were affected the least by environment, indicating the stability of the trait. Two QTL were detected for grain yield and 19 for thousand-grain weight in all DH lines. The number of QTL per trait per location ranged from zero to four. Clustering of the QTL for different traits at the same marker intervals was observed for plant height, panicle number, panicle length and spikelet number suggesting that pleiotropism and or tight linkage of different traits could be the possible reason for the congruence of several QTL. The many QTL detected by the same marker interval across environments indicate that QTL for most traits are stable and not essentially affected by environmental factors.
12721640	Linkage mapping of Hsa-1(Og), a resistance gene of African rice to the cyst nematode, Heterodera sacchari.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Inheritance of resistance to cyst nematode (Heterodera sacchari) in Oryza sativa was investigated by inoculation tests with isolate 244 from Congo in segregating populations derived from hybridisation between O. sativa and its African sister cultivated species, O. glaberrima. We found that the resistance was controlled by one major gene, Hsa-1(Og), with codominance of susceptible and resistant alleles. To map Hsa-1(Og) on the rice genome, we pooled the data obtained from segregation of the resistance trait and microsatellite markers in three kinds of progeny: BC(1)F(3), BC(1)F(4), and pseudo-F(2) populations. Hsa-1(Og) was unambiguously located between Cornell University's RM206 and RM254 markers on chromosome 11. Two additional microsatellite markers derived from Monsanto publicly available sequences were found to be tightly linked to the Hsa-1(Og) gene. It is possible that numerous plant resistances to a pathogen in fact exhibit a codominant inheritance, possibly explaining misleading conclusions in several reports on resistance segregation.
12827251	Fine mapping of the rice thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile gene tms5.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	AnnongS-1, a thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) rice line, has a new TGMS gene. Genetic analysis indicated that the sterility of AnnongS-1 was controlled by a single resessive gene named tms5. In our previous studies based on an F(2) population from the cross between AnnongS-1 and Nanjing11, tms5 was mapped on chromosome 2. Recently, a RIL (recombinant inbred line) population from the same cross was developed and used for the fine mapping of the tms5 gene. Molecular marker techniques combined with BSA (bulked segregant analysis) were used. As a result, two AFLP markers (AF10, AF8), one RAPD marker (RA4), one STS marker (C365-1), one CAPs marker (G227-1) and four SSR markers (RM279, RM492, RM327, RM324) were found to be closely linked to tms5 gene. The DNA sequences of the RFLP marker of C365 and G227 were found in GenBank, and on the basis of these sequences, many primers were designed to amplify the two parents and their RIL population plants. Finally, the tms5 gene was mapped between STS marker C365-1 and CAPs marker G227-1 at a distance of 1.04 cM from C365-1 and 2.08 cM from G227-1.
12955204	Molecular markers linked to the blast resistance gene Pi-z in rice for use in marker-assisted selection.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Pyricularia grisea, is a serious disease affecting rice-growing regions around the world. Current methods for identification of blast-resistant germplasm and progeny typically utilize phenotypic screening. However, phenotypic screens are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of one resistance gene can sometimes phenotypically mask other genes conferring resistance to the same blast race. Pi-z is a dominant gene located on the short arm of chromosome 6 that confers complete resistance to five races of blast. Using sequence data found in public databases and degenerate primer pairs based on the P-loop, nucleotide binding sites and kinase domain motifs of previously cloned resistance genes, we have developed PCR-based DNA markers that cosegregate with the gene. These markers are polymorphic in a wide range of germplasm, including the narrow crosses characteristic of applied rice-breeding programs. They can now be used as a low cost, high-throughput alternative to conventional phenotypic screening for direct detection of blast resistance genes, allowing rapid introgression of genes into susceptible varieties as well as the incorporation of multiple genes into individual lines for more-durable blast resistance.
12838393	Identification and fine mapping of Pi33, the rice resistance gene corresponding to the Magnaporthe grisea avirulence gene ACE1.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Rice blast disease is a major constraint for rice breeding. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of resistance remains poorly understood for most rice varieties, and new resistance genes remain to be identified. We identified the resistance gene corresponding to the cloned avirulence gene ACE1 using pairs of isogenic strains of Magnaporthe grisea differing only by their ACE1 allele. This resistance gene was mapped on the short arm of rice chromosome 8 using progenies from the crosses IR64 (resistant) x Azucena (susceptible) and Azucena x Bala (resistant). The isogenic strains also permitted the detection of this resistance gene in several rice varieties, including the differential isogenic line C101LAC. Allelism tests permitted us to distinguish this gene from two other resistance genes [ Pi11 and Pi-29(t)] that are present on the short arm of chromosome 8. Segregation analysis in F(2) populations was in agreement with the existence of a single dominant gene, designated as Pi33. Finally, Pi33 was finely mapped between two molecular markers of the rice genetic map that are separated by a distance of 1.6 cM. Detection of Pi33 in different semi-dwarf indica varieties indicated that this gene could originate from either one or a few varieties.
12898024	Fine linkage mapping enables dissection of closely linked quantitative trait loci for seed dormancy and heading in rice.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy (tentatively designated Sdr1) and heading date ( Hd8) have been mapped to approximately the same region on chromosome 3 by interval mapping of backcross inbred lines derived from crosses between the rice cultivars Nipponbare (japonica) and Kasalath (indica). To clarify whether Sdr1 and Hd8 could be dissected genetically, we carried out fine-scale mapping with an advanced backcross progeny. We selected a BC(4)F(1) plant, in which a small chromosomal region including Sdr1 and Hd8, on the short arm of chromosome 3, remained heterozygous, whereas all the other chromosomal regions were homozygous for Nipponbare. Days-to-heading and seed germination rate in the BC(4)F(2) plants showed continuous variation. Ten BC(4)F(2) plants with recombination in the vicinity of Sdr1 and Hd8 were selected on the basis of the genotypes of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers flanking both QTLs. Genotypes of those plants for Sdr1 and Hd8 were determined by advanced progeny testing of BC(4)F(4) families. Sdr1 was mapped between the RFLP markers R10942 and C2045, and co-segregated with C1488. Hd8 was also mapped between C12534S and R10942. Six recombination events were detected between Sdr1 and Hd8. These results clearly demonstrate that Sdr1 and Hd8 were tightly linked. Nearly isogenic lines for Sdr1 and Hd8 were selected by marker-assisted selection.
14513215	Identification of quantitative trait loci for yield and yield components in an advanced backcross population derived from the Oryza sativa variety IR64 and the wild relative O. rufipogon.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	A BC(2)F(2) population developed from an interspecific cross between Oryza sativa (cv IR64) and O. rufipogon (IRGC 105491) was used in an advanced backcross QTL analysis to identify and introduce agronomically useful genes from this wild relative into the cultivated gene pool. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify putative yield and yield component QTLs that can be useful to improve the elite cultivar IR64; (2) to compare the QTLs within this study with previously reported QTLs in rice as the basis for identifying QTLs that are stable across different environments and genetic backgrounds; and (3) to compare the identified QTLs with previously reported QTLs from maize to examine the degree of QTL conservation across the grass family. Two hundred eighty-five families were evaluated in two field environments in Indonesia, with two replications each, for 12 agronomic traits. A total of 165 markers consisting of 131 SSRs and 34 RFLPs were used to construct the genetic linkage map. By employing interval mapping and composite interval mapping, 42 QTLs were identified. Despite its inferior performance, 33% of the QTL alleles originating from O. rufipogon had a beneficial effect for yield and yield components in the IR64 background. Twenty-two QTLs (53.4%) were located in similar regions as previously reported rice QTLs, suggesting the existence of stable QTLs across genetic backgrounds and environments. Twenty QTLs (47.6%) were exclusively detected in this study, uncovering potentially novel alleles from the wild, some of which might improve the performance of the tropical indica variety IR64. Additionally, several QTLs for plant height, grain weight, and flowering time detected in this study corresponded to homeologous regions in maize containing previously detected maize QTLs for these traits.
14513216	Identification of quantitative trait loci for grain quality in an advanced backcross population derived from the Oryza sativa variety IR64 and the wild relative O. rufipogon.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with grain quality in rice. Two hundred eighty-five BC(2)F(2 )families developed from an interspecific cross between cv IR64 and Oryza rufipogon (IRGC 105491) were evaluated for 14 seed quality traits. A total of 165 markers consisting of 131 single sequence repeats and 34 restriction fragment length polymorphism markers were used to create a genetic linkage map spanning the 12 rice chromosomes. Twenty-three independent QTLs were identified using single point analysis, interval mapping, and composite interval mapping. These loci consisted of one QTL for filled rough/total rough rice ratio, two for grain density, one for percentage of de-husked rice grains, two for percentage of green rice grains, three for percentage of damaged-yellow rice grains, two for percentage of red rice grains, one for milled rice recovery, three for head rice recovery, four for broken rice grains, two for crushed rice grains, one for amylose content, and one for gel consistency. For most of the QTLs identified in this study, the O. rufipogon-derived allele contributed an undesirable effect. For amylose content and gel consistency, the O. rufipogon allele may be useful in an IR64 background, depending on the cultural preferences of the consumer. Careful selection against the regions associated with negative effects will be required to avoid unwanted grain quality characteristics during the development of improved varieties for yield and yield components using introgressions from O. rufipogon.
12898021	Mapping of quantitative trait loci associated with ultraviolet-B resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2003	Theor Appl Genet	The detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with UV-B resistance in rice should allow their practical application in breeding for such a complex trait, and may lead to the identification of gene characteristics and functions. Considerable variation in UV-B resistance exists within cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), but its detailed genetic control mechanism has not been well elucidated. We detected putative QTLs associated with the resistance to enhanced UV-B radiation in rice, using 98 BC(1)F(5) (backcross inbred lines; BILs) derived from a cross between Nipponbare (a resistant japonica rice variety) and Kasalath (a sensitive indica rice variety). We used 245 RFLP markers to construct a framework linkage map. BILs and both parents were grown under visible light with or without supplemental UV-B radiation in a growth chamber. In order to evaluate UV-B resistance, we used the relative fresh weight of aerial parts (RFW) and the relative chlorophyll content of leaf blades (RCC). The BIL population exhibited a wide range of variation in RFW and RCC. Using composite interval mapping with a LOD threshold of 2.9, three putative QTLs associated with both RFW and RCC were detected on chromosomes 1, 3 and 10. Nipponbare alleles at the QTLs on chromosome 1 and 10 increased the RFW and RCC, while the Kasalath allele at the QTL on chromosome 3 increased both traits. Furthermore, the existence of both QTLs on chromosomes 1 and 10 for UV-B resistance was confirmed using chromosome segment substitution lines. Plants with Kasalath alleles at the QTL on chromosome 10 were more sensitive to UV-B radiation than plants with them on chromosome 1. These results also provide the information not only for the improvement of UV-B resistance in rice though marker-associated selection, but also for the identification of UV-B resistance mechanisms by using near-isogenic lines.
14614563	Delimitation of the chromosomal region for a quantitative trait locus, qUVR- 10, conferring resistance to ultraviolet-B radiation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Wide variation in ultraviolet-B (UVB) resistance is observed among rice varieties. In a previous study, three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling UVB resistance were detected by QTL analysis, using backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between a japonica cultivar, 'Nipponbare', and an indica cultivar, 'Kasalath'. Among them, qUVR- 10, a QTL for UVB resistance on chromosome 10, showed the largest effect. Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at qUVR- 10 were resistant to UVB, unlike those homozygous for the Kasalath allele. To determine more precisely the chromosomal location of qUVR- 10, we performed a linkage mapping of qUVR- 10 as a single Mendelian factor using advanced backcross progeny. Advanced progeny testing of F(4) families enabled us to determine the genotype classes of the qUVR- 10 locus with high reliability. As a result, qUVR- 10 was mapped between RFLP markers C60755S and C1757S, and co-segregated with C913A. In addition, a sequence showing high similarity to the Arabidopsis cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase gene, which has been found to be involved in sensitivity to UV radiation in Arabidopsis and rice, was mapped in the candidate genomic region of qUVR- 10. This result suggests that the CPD photolyase gene is a positional candidate for qUVR- 10.
14740086	Development of PCR-based SNP markers for rice blast resistance genes at the Piz locus.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	We assessed the utility of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels) as DNA markers in genetic analysis and breeding of rice. Toward this end, we surveyed SNPs and InDels in the chromosomal region containing the Piz and Piz-t rice blast resistance genes and developed PCR-based markers for typing the SNPs. Analysis of sequences from a blast-susceptible Japanese cultivar and two cultivars each containing one of these genes revealed that SNPs are abundant in the Piz and Piz-t regions (on average, one SNP every 248 bp), but the number of InDels was much lower. The dense distribution of SNPs facilitated the generation of SNP markers in the vicinity of the genes. For typing these SNPs, we used a modified allele-specific PCR method. Of the 49 candidate allele-specific markers, 33 unambiguously and reproducibly discriminated between the two alleles. We used the markers for mapping the Piz and Piz-t genes and evaluating the size of DNA segments introgressed from the Piz donor cultivar in Japanese near-isogenic lines containing Piz. Our findings suggest that, because of its ability to generate numerous markers within a target region and its simplicity in assaying genotypes, SNP genotyping with allele-specific PCR is a valuable tool for gene mapping, map-based cloning, and marker-assisted selection in crops, especially rice.
14513218	QTLs for Na+ and K+ uptake of the shoots and roots controlling rice salt tolerance.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	An F2 and an equivalent F3 population derived from a cross between a high salt-tolerance indica variety, Nona Bokra, and a susceptible elite japonica variety, Koshihikari, were produced. We performed QTL mapping for physiological traits related to rice salt-tolerance. Three QTLs for survival days of seedlings (SDSs) under salt stress were detected on chromosomes 1, 6 and 7, respectively, and explained 13.9% to 18.0% of the total phenotypic variance. Based on the correlations between SDSs and other physiological traits, it was considered that damage of leaves was attributed to accumulation of Na+ in the shoot by transport of Na+ from the root to the shoot in external high concentration. We found eight QTLs including three for three traits of the shoots, and five for four traits of the roots at five chromosomal regions, controlled complex physiological traits related to rice salt-tolerance under salt stress. Of these QTLs, the two major QTLs with the very large effect, qSNC-7 for shoot Na+ concentration and qSKC-1 for shoot K+ concentration, explained 48.5% and 40.1% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. The QTLs detected between the shoots and the roots almost did not share the same map locations, suggesting that the genes controlling the transport of Na+ and K+ between the shoots and the roots may be different.
14523518	Isolation and characterization of rice mutants compromised in Xa21-mediated resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	The rice gene, Xa21, confers resistance to diverse races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and encodes a receptor-like kinase with leucine-rich repeats in the extra-cellular domain. To identify genes essential for the function of the Xa21 gene, 4,500 IRBB21 ( Xa21 isogenic line in IR24 background) mutants, induced by diepoxybutane and fast neutrons, were screened against Philippine race six (PR6) Xoo for a change from resistance to susceptibility. From two greenhouse screens, 23 mutants were identified that had changed from resistant to fully (6) or partially (17) susceptible to PR6. All fully susceptible mutants carried rearrangements at the Xa21 locus as detected by PCR and Southern hybridization. For the partially susceptible mutants, no changes were detected at the Xa21 locus based on Southern and PCR analyses. However, two of these mutants were confirmed via genetic analysis to have mutations at the Xa21 locus. Partially susceptible mutants exhibited variation in level of susceptibility to different Xoo strains, suggesting that they may carry different mutations required for the Xa21-mediated resistance. The mutants identified in this study provide useful materials for dissecting the Xa21-mediated resistance pathway in rice.
14605807	Isolation and characterization of novel defense response genes involved in compatible and incompatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	To identify early-induced defense genes involved in broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to generate two cDNA libraries enriched for transcripts differentially expressed in Pi9(t)-resistant and -susceptible plants. After differential screening by membrane-based hybridization and subsequent confirmation by reverse Northern blot analysis, selected clones were sequenced and analyzed. Forty-seven unique cDNA clones were found and assigned to eight different groups according to the putative function of their homologous genes in the database. These genes may be involved in pathogen or stress response, signal transduction, transcription, cell transport, metabolism, energy or protein destination. Northern blot analysis showed that most of these genes were induced or suppressed after blast infection, and that half of them showed differential expression patterns between compatible and incompatible interactions. Interestingly, all but one of the identified genes are reported here for the first time to be involved in defense response to rice blast. In addition, hybridization of these clones with cDNAs synthesized from RNA samples from bacterial blight-infected leaves showed that few of them are induced or repressed in Xa21- or Xa7-resistant plants, suggesting a minimum overlap of defense responses mediated by different resistance genes to fungal and bacterial pathogens at an early stage of infection. Further characterization and functional analysis of these genes will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance in rice.
14564397	The genetic basis of stay-green in rice analyzed in a population of doubled haploid lines derived from an indica by japonica cross.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Delayed leaf-senescence, or stay-green, has been regarded as a desired characteristic for the production of a number of crops including rice. In this study, we analyzed the genetic basis of stay-green using a population of 190 doubled haploid lines from the cross between an indica parent Zhenshan 97 and a stay-green japonica parent Wuyujing 2. The population was tested in replicated field trials in 2 consecutive years, and six traits were defined to evaluate the stay-green characteristics. A genetic linkage map with 179 SSR (simple sequence repeat) marker loci was constructed. The software QTLMapper, based on a mixed linear model approach, was applied to detect QTLs, epistatic effects and their environmental interactions for these traits. A total of 46 main-effect QTLs was detected for the six traits that can be localized to 25 chromosomal regions. The individual effects of all the QTLs were small. Fifty digenic interactions were resolved that involved 66 loci distributed on all 12 chromosomes. Environmental interactions were detected for 18 of the main-effect QTLs and 14 of the epistatic interactions. Collectively, the epistatic effects and QTL by year interactions accounted for large proportions of the phenotypic variations. The results also showed that most of the stay-green traits were negatively correlated with yield and its component traits. The implications of the results in crop improvement were discussed.
14624339	Mapping of quantitative trait loci controlling low-temperature germinability in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Low-temperature germination is one of the major determinants for stable stand establishment in the direct seeding method in temperate regions, and at high altitudes of tropical regions. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling low-temperature germinability in rice were identified using 122 backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between temperate japonica varieties, Italica Livorno and Hayamasari. The germination rate at 15 degrees C was measured to represent low-temperature germination and used for QTL analysis. The germination rate at 15 degrees C for 7 days of Italica Livorno and Hayamasari was 98.7 and 26.8%, respectively, and that of BILs ranged from 0 to 83.3%. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, we constructed a linkage map which corresponded to about 90% of the rice genome. Three putative QTLs associated with low-temperature germination were detected. The most effective QTL, qLTG-3-1 on chromosome 3, accounted for 35.0% of the total phenotypic variation for low-temperature germinability. Two additional QTLs, qLTG-3-2 on chromosome 3 and qLTG-4 on chromosome 4, were detected and accounted for 17.4 and 5.5% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. The Italica Livorno alleles in all detected QTLs increased the low-temperature germination rate.
15118822	High-resolution genetic mapping of Xa27(t), a new bacterial blight resistance gene in rice, Oryza sativa L.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo) (Ishyama) Dye, is one of the serious diseases prevalent throughout Asia. In a previous study, a resistance ( R) locus was transferred from the tetraploid wild rice Oryza minuta to the cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa L. Here, we report the fine genetic mapping of the R locus, tentatively designated as Xa27(t). We performed disease evaluation with an Xa27(t) near-isogenic line, IRBB27, testing 35 Xoo strains collected from 11 countries. The Xa27(t) locus conferred a high level of resistance to 27 strains and moderate resistance to three strains. Resistance of the Xa27(t) gene was developmentally regulated in IRBB27 and showed semi-dominant or a dosage effect in the cv. CO39 genetic background. As a prelude to cloning Xa27(t), a molecular mapping strategy was employed with a large mapping population consisting of 3,875 gametes. Three molecular markers, M336, M1081, and M1059, closely linked to Xa27(t), were identified to facilitate the mapping of Xa27(t) to the long arm of chromosome 6. The Xa27(t) locus was confirmed by chromosome landing of M1081 and M1095 markers on the rice genome. Markers derived from the genomic sequence of O. sativa cv. Nipponbare were used to further saturate the Xa27(t) genomic region. Xa27(t) was finally located within a genetic interval of 0.052 cM, flanked by markers M964 and M1197, and co-segregated with markers M631, M1230, and M449.
14634728	Synteny between a major heading-date QTL in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and the Hd3 heading-date locus in rice.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	The genetic control of induction to flowering has been studied extensively in both model and crop species because of its fundamental biological and economic significance. An ultimate aim of many of these studies has been the application of the understanding of control of flowering that can be gained from the study of model species, to the improvement of crop species. The present study identifies a region of genetic synteny between rice and Lolium perenne, which contains the Hd3 heading-date QTL in rice and a major QTL, accounting for up to 70% of the variance associated with heading date in L. perenne. The identification of synteny between rice and L. perenne in this region demonstrates the direct applicability of the rice genome to the understanding of biological processes in other species. Specifically, this syntenic relationship will greatly facilitate the genetic dissection of aspects of heading-date induction by enabling the magnitude of the genetic component of the heading-date QTL in L. perenne to be combined with the sequencing and annotation information from the rice genome.
12582657	Mapping of the QTL (quantitative trait locus) conferring partial resistance to leaf blast in rice cultivar Chubu 32.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	The rice cultivar Chubu 32 possesses a high level of partial resistance to leaf blast. The number and chromosomal location of genes conferring this resistance were detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. For the mapping, 149 F(3) lines derived from the cross between rice cultivar Norin 29, with a low level of partial resistance, and Chubu 32 were used, and their partial resistance to leaf blast was assessed in upland nurseries. A linkage map covering six chromosomes and consisting of 36 RFLP markers was constructed. In the map, only one significant QTL (LOD>2.0) for partial resistance was detected on chromosome 11. This QTL explained 45.6% of the phenotypic variation. The segregation ratio of the F3 lines was 3:1 for partial resistance to susceptibility. These results suggest that the partial resistance in Chubu 32 is controlled by a major gene.
12642667	Convergent evolution of perenniality in rice and sorghum.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Annual and perennial habit are two major strategies by which grasses adapt to seasonal environmental change, and these distinguish cultivated cereals from their wild relatives. Rhizomatousness, a key trait contributing to perenniality, was investigated by using an F(2) population from a cross between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relative, Oryza longistaminata. Molecular mapping based on a complete simple sequence-repeat map revealed two dominant-complementary genes controlling rhizomatousness. Rhz3 was mapped to the interval between markers OSR16 [1.3 centimorgans (cM)] and OSR13 (8.1 cM) on rice chromosome 4 and Rhz2 located between RM119 (2.2 cM) and RM273 (7.4 cM) on chromosome 3. Comparative mapping indicated that each gene closely corresponds to major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizomatousness in Sorghum propinquum, a wild relative of cultivated sorghum. Correspondence of these genes in rice and sorghum, which diverged from a common ancestor approximately 50 million years ago, suggests that the two genes may be key regulators of rhizome development in many Poaceae. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were identified, most of which also corresponded to the locations of S. propinquum QTLs. Convergent evolution of independent mutations at, in some cases, corresponding genes may have been responsible for the evolution of annual cereals from perennial wild grasses. DNA markers closely linked to Rhz2 and Rhz3 will facilitate cloning of the genes, which may contribute significantly to our understanding of grass evolution, advance opportunities to develop perennial cereals, and offer insights into environmentally benign weed-control strategies.
12773633	Introduction of Wx transgene into rice wx mutants leads to both high- and low-amylose rice.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	The Waxy (Wx) gene encodes a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) that plays a key role in the amylose synthesis of rice and other plant species. Two functional Wx alleles of rice exist: Wx(a), which produces a large amount of amylose, and Wx(b), which produces a smaller amount of amylose because of the mutation at the 5' splice site of intron 1. Wx(b) is largely distributed in Japonica cultivars, and high amylose cultivars do not exist in Japonica cultivars. We introduced the cloned Wx(a) cDNA into null-mutant Japonica rice (wx). The amylose contents of these transgenic plants were 6-11% higher than that of the original cultivar, Labelle, which carries the Wx(a) allele, although the levels of the Wx protein in the transgenic rice were equal to those of cv. Labelle. We also observed a gene-dosage effect of the Wx(a) transgene on Wx protein expression, but a smaller dosage effect was observed in amylose production with over 40% of amylose content in transgenic rice. Moreover, one transgenic line carrying eleven copies of the transgene showed low levels of Wx expression and amylose in the endosperm. This suggested that the integration of excessive copies of the transgene might lead to gene silencing.
14519768	Rice globular embryo 4 (gle4) mutant is defective in radial pattern formation during embryogenesis.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	In higher plants, the main elements of the fundamental body plan, the apical-basal and radial patterns, are established during embryogenesis. We have isolated several globular embryo (gle) mutants of rice that fail to develop any embryonic organs. We expected that these gle mutants might include mutants defective in their radial pattern formation ability. We developed two markers specifically staining the L2 and L3 layers (OsSCR and OsPNH1, respectively) and characterized the gle mutants by using these markers in addition to the already developed markers Roc1 (marker for the L1 layer), Ramy1A (marker of the L1 layer of the epithelium), and OSH1 (marker of the apical region). One of the gle mutants, gle4, expressed Roc1 and Ramy1A at the normal positions, but other markers exhibited an abnormal expression pattern; that is, both OsPNH1 and OsSCR were expressed in the central region of the embryo and OSH1 expression was not observed. Calli from the gle4 epithelium regenerated plants with abnormal morphologies. These results indicate that the GLE4 gene is involved in radial pattern formation during rice embryogenesis to differentiate the L2 and L3 layers, but is not involved in the establishment of the L1 layer or in the formation of embryonic organs.
14701935	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al. (2003), Plant Cell Physiol. 44: 726]. To clarify the feedback mechanisms, and to identify regulatory factors of the OsAMT1 genes, the accumulation of the three mRNAs and its dependence on endogenous nitrogen compounds (as quantified by capillary electrophoresis) was studied. Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels. The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium. The ammonium effects on OsAMT1 expression were prevented by methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Moreover, glutamine had the same effect on transcriptional regulation of OsAMT1 genes as ammonium, indicating that glutamine rather than ammonium controls the expression of ammonium transporter genes in rice. These results imply that rice possesses unique mechanisms of adaptation to variable nitrogen sources in the soil.
9112771	Expansins in deepwater rice internodes.	1997	Plant Physiol	Cell walls of deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) internodes undergo long-term extension (creep) when placed under tension in acidic buffers. This is indicative of the action of the cell wall-loosening protein expansin. Wall extension had a pH optimum of around 4.0 and was abolished by boiling. Acid-induced extension of boiled cell walls could be reconstituted by addition of salt-extracted rice or cucumber cell wall proteins. Cucumber expansin antibody recognized a single protein band of 24.5-kD apparent molecular mass on immunoblots of rice cell wall proteins. Expansins were partially purified by concanavalin A affinity chromatography and sulfopropyl (SP) cation-exchange chromatography. The latter yielded two peaks with extension activity (SP20 and SP29), and immunoblot analysis showed that both of these active fractions contained expansin of 24.5-kD molecular mass. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SP20 expansin is identical to that deduced from the rice expansin cDNA Os-EXP1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SP29 expansin matches that deduced from the rice expansin cDNA Os-EXP2 in six of eight amino acids. Our results show that two expansins occur in the cell walls of rice internodes and that they may mediate acid-induced wall extension.
9596635	Xa21D encodes a receptor-like molecule with a leucine-rich repeat domain that determines race-specific recognition and is subject to adaptive evolution.	1998	Plant Cell	The rice Xa21 gene confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae in a race-specific manner. Analysis of the inheritance patterns and resistance spectra of transgenic plants carrying six Xa21 gene family members indicated that one member, designated Xa21D, displayed a resistance spectrum identical to that observed for Xa21 but conferred only partial resistance. Xa21D encodes a receptor-like protein carrying leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs in the presumed extracellular domain. The Xa21D transcript terminates shortly after the stop codon introduced by the retrotransposon Retrofit. Comparison of nucleotide substitutions in the LRR coding regions of Xa21 and Xa21D provided evidence of adaptive selection. Both functional and evolutionary evidence indicates that the Xa21D LRR domain controls race-specific pathogen recognition.
9724697	A recessive heterochronic mutation, plastochron1, shortens the plastochron and elongates the vegetative phase in rice	1998	Plant Cell	We describe two recessive alleles of a rice heterochronic gene, plastochron1-1 (pla1-1) and pla1-2, that reduce the length of the plastochron to approximately half that of the wild type. Because the onset of the reproductive phase in pla1 was not temporally affected, the number of leaves produced in the vegetative phase was nearly twice that produced in the wild type. Panicle development was severely disturbed in pla1 mutants. In pla1-1, many primordia of primary rachis branches were converted into vegetative shoots. These ectopic shoots repeated the initiation of panicle development and the conversion of primary rachis branches into shoots. In the weak allele pla1-2, however, only the basal one or two primordia developed as vegetative shoots, and the remaining primordia developed to produce a truncated panicle. These results indicate that both vegetative and reproductive programs are expressed simultaneously during the reproductive phase of pla1; however, the degree varied depending on the strength of the allele. Accordingly, pla1 is a heterochronic mutation that extends the vegetative period. The shoot apical meristem of pla1 was larger than that of the wild type, although the shape was not modified. An in situ hybridization experiment using the histone H4 gene as a probe revealed that cell divisions are accelerated in the pla1 meristem. The PLA1 gene is considered to regulate the duration of the vegetative phase by controlling the rate of leaf production in the meristem.
11006334	Loss of function of a rice brassinosteroid insensitive1 homolog prevents internode elongation and bending of the lamina joint.	2000	Plant Cell	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant growth-promoting natural products required for plant growth and development. Physiological studies have demonstrated that exogenous BR, alone or in combination with auxin, enhance bending of the lamina joint of rice. However, little is known about the function of endogenous BR in rice or other grass species. We report here the phenotypical and molecular characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, d61, that is less sensitive to BR compared to the wild type. We cloned a rice gene, OsBRI1, with extensive sequence similarity to that of the Arabidopsis BRI gene, which encodes a putative BR receptor kinase. Linkage analysis showed that the OsBRI1 gene is closely linked to the d61 locus. Single nucleotide substitutions found at different sites of the d61 alleles would give rise to amino acid changes in the corresponding polypeptides. Furthermore, introduction of the entire OsBRI1 coding region, including the 5' and 3' flanking sequences, into d61 plants complemented the mutation to display the wild-type phenotype. Transgenic plants carrying the antisense strand of the OsBRI1 transcript showed similar or even more severe phenotypes than those of the d61 mutants. Our results show that OsBRI1 functions in various growth and developmental processes in rice, including (1) internode elongation, by inducing the formation of the intercalary meristem and the longitudinal elongation of internode cells; (2) bending of the lamina joint; and (3) skotomorphogenesis.
11090206	A telomeric avirulence gene determines efficacy for the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta.	2000	Plant Cell	Genetic mapping showed that the rice blast avirulence gene AVR-Pita is tightly linked to a telomere on chromosome 3 in the plant pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea. AVR-Pita corresponds in gene-for-gene fashion to the disease resistance (R) gene Pi-ta. Analysis of spontaneous avr-pita(-) mutants indicated that the gene is located in a telomeric 6.5-kb BglII restriction fragment. Cloning and DNA sequencing led to the identification of a candidate gene with features typical of metalloproteases. This gene is located entirely within the most distal 1.5 kb of the chromosome. When introduced into virulent rice pathogens, the cloned gene specifically confers avirulence toward rice cultivars that contain Pi-ta. Frequent spontaneous loss of AVR-Pita appears to be the result of its telomeric location. Diverse mutations in AVR-Pita, including point mutations, insertions, and deletions, permit the fungus to avoid triggering resistance responses mediated by Pi-ta. A point mutation in the protease consensus sequence abolishes the AVR-Pita avirulence function.
11340177	slender rice, a constitutive gibberellin response mutant, is caused by a null mutation of the SLR1 gene, an ortholog of the height-regulating gene GAI/RGA/RHT/D8.	2001	Plant Cell	The rice slender mutant (slr1-1) is caused by a single recessive mutation and results in a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. The mutant elongates as if saturated with GAs. In this mutant, (1) elongation was unaffected by an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, (2) GA-inducible alpha-amylase was produced by the aleurone layers without gibberellic acid application, and (3) endogenous GA content was lower than in the wild-type plant. These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway. SLR1 maps to OsGAI in rice and has significant homology with height-regulating genes, such as RHT-1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis. The GAI gene family is likely to encode transcriptional factors belonging to the GRAS gene superfamily. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the slr1-1 mutation is a single basepair deletion of the nuclear localization signal domain, resulting in a frameshift mutation that abolishes protein production. Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type SLR1 gene into the slr1-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal. These results indicate that the slr1-1 mutant is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the SLR1 gene, which is an ortholog of GAI, RGA, RHT, and D8. We also succeeded in producing GA-insensitive dwarf rice by transforming wild-type rice with a modified SLR1 gene construct that has a 17-amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region. Thus, we demonstrate opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in SLR1.
11251094	Isolation and characterization of rice phytochrome A mutants.	2001	Plant Cell	To elucidate phytochrome A (phyA) function in rice, we screened a large population of retrotransposon (Tos17) insertional mutants by polymerase chain reaction and isolated three independent phyA mutant lines. Sequencing of the Tos17 insertion sites confirmed that the Tos17s interrupted exons of PHYA genes in these mutant lines. Moreover, the phyA polypeptides were not immunochemically detectable in these phyA mutants. The seedlings of phyA mutants grown in continuous far-red light showed essentially the same phenotype as dark-grown seedlings, indicating the insensitivity of phyA mutants to far-red light. The etiolated seedlings of phyA mutants also were insensitive to a pulse of far-red light or very low fluence red light. In contrast, phyA mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wild type under continuous red light. Therefore, rice phyA controls photomorphogenesis in two distinct modes of photoperception--far-red light-dependent high irradiance response and very low fluence response--and such function seems to be unique and restricted to the deetiolation process. Interestingly, continuous far-red light induced the expression of CAB and RBCS genes in rice phyA seedlings, suggesting the existence of a photoreceptor(s) other than phyA that can perceive continuous far-red light in the etiolated seedlings.
11826299	The gibberellin signaling pathway is regulated by the appearance and disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in nuclei.	2002	Plant Cell	The slender rice1 mutant (slr1) shows a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. To investigate the mode of action of SLR1, we generated transgenic rice expressing a fusion protein consisting of SLR1 and green fluorescent protein (SLR1-GFP) and analyzed the phenotype of the transformants and the subcellular localization of GFP in vivo. SLR1-GFP worked in nuclei to repress the GA signaling pathway; its overproduction caused a dwarf phenotype. Application of GA(3) to SLR1-GFP overproducers induced GA actions such as shoot elongation, downregulation of GA 20-oxidase expression, and upregulation of SLR1 expression linked with the disappearance of the nuclear SLR1-GFP protein. We also performed domain analyses of SLR1 using transgenic plants overproducing different kinds of truncated SLR1 proteins. The analyses revealed that the SLR1 protein can be divided into four parts: a GA signal perception domain located at the N terminus, a regulatory domain for its repression activity, a dimer formation domain essential for signal perception and repression activity, and a repression domain at the C terminus. We conclude that GA signal transduction is regulated by the appearance or disappearance of the nuclear SLR1 protein, which is controlled by the upstream GA signal.
10022841	Loss-of-function mutations in the rice homeobox gene OSH15 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants.	1999	EMBO J	The rice homeobox gene OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox) is a member of the knotted1-type homeobox gene family. We report here on the identification and characterization of a loss-of-function mutation in OSH15 from a library of retrotransposon-tagged lines of rice. Based on the phenotype and map position, we have identified three independent deletion alleles of the locus among conventional morphological mutants. All of these recessive mutations, which are considered to be null alleles, exhibit defects in internode elongation. Introduction of a 14 kbp genomic DNA fragment that includes all exons, introns and 5'- and 3'- flanking sequences of OSH15 complemented the defects in internode elongation, confirming that they were caused by the loss-of-function of OSH15. Internodes of the mutants had abnormal-shaped epidermal and hypodermal cells and showed an unusual arrangement of small vascular bundles. These mutations demonstrate a role for OSH15 in the development of rice internodes. This is the first evidence that the knotted1-type homeobox genes have roles other than shoot apical meristem formation and/or maintenance in plant development.
11549765	Functional analysis of the conserved domains of a rice KNOX homeodomain protein, OSH15.	2001	Plant Cell	The rice KNOX protein OSH15 consists of four conserved domains: the MEINOX domain, which can be divided into two subdomains (KNOX1 and KNOX2); the GSE domain; the ELK domain; and the homeodomain (HD). To investigate the function of each domain, we generated 10 truncated proteins with deletions in the conserved domains and four proteins with mutations in the conserved amino acids in the HD. Transgenic analysis suggested that KNOX2 and HD are essential for inducing the abnormal phenotype and that the KNOX1 and ELK domains affect phenotype severity. We also found that both KNOX2 and HD are necessary for homodimerization and that only HD is needed for binding of OSH15 to its target sequence. Transactivation studies suggested that both the KNOX1 and ELK domains play a role in suppressing target gene expression. On the basis of these findings, we propose that overproduced OSH15 probably acts as a dimer and may ectopically suppress the expression of target genes that induce abnormal morphology in transgenic plants.
12897251	Target site specificity of the Tos17 retrotransposon shows a preference for insertion within genes and against insertion in retrotransposon-rich regions of the genome.	2003	Plant Cell	Because retrotransposons are the major component of plant genomes, analysis of the target site selection of retrotransposons is important for understanding the structure and evolution of plant genomes. Here, we examined the target site specificity of the rice retrotransposon Tos17, which can be activated by tissue culture. We have produced 47,196 Tos17-induced insertion mutants of rice. This mutant population carries approximately 500,000 insertions. We analyzed >42,000 flanking sequences of newly transposed Tos17 copies from 4316 mutant lines. More than 20,000 unique loci were assigned on the rice genomic sequence. Analysis of these sequences showed that insertion events are three times more frequent in genic regions than in intergenic regions. Consistent with this result, Tos17 was shown to prefer gene-dense regions over centromeric heterochromatin regions. Analysis of insertion target sequences revealed a palindromic consensus sequence, ANGTT-TSD-AACNT, flanking the 5-bp target site duplication. Although insertion targets are distributed throughout the chromosomes, they tend to cluster, and 76% of the clusters are located in genic regions. The mechanisms of target site selection by Tos17, the utility of the mutant lines, and the knockout gene database are discussed. --The nucleotide sequence data were uploaded to the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank nucleotide sequence databases under accession numbers AG020727 to AG025611 and AG205093 to AG215049.
14615594	A rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), is caused by a loss of function of a new member of cytochrome P450.	2003	Plant Cell	We characterized a rice dwarf mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2). It showed the pleiotropic abnormal phenotype similar to that of the rice brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61. The dwarf phenotype of d2 was rescued by exogenous brassinolide treatment. The accumulation profile of BR intermediates in the d2 mutants confirmed that these plants are deficient in late BR biosynthesis. We cloned the D2 gene by map-based cloning. The D2 gene encoded a novel cytochrome P450 classified in CYP90D that is highly similar to the reported BR synthesis enzymes. Introduction of the wild D2 gene into d2-1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants. In feeding experiments, 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone, 3-dehydroteasterone, and brassinolide effectively caused the lamina joints of the d2 plants to bend, whereas more upstream compounds did not cause bending. Based on these results, we conclude that D2/CYP90D2 catalyzes the steps from 6-deoxoteasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone and from teasterone to 3-dehydroteasterone in the late BR biosynthesis pathway.
14688295	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development.	2004	Plant Cell	GAMYB was first isolated as a positive transcriptional regulator of gibberellin (GA)-dependent alpha-amylase expression in barley aleurone cells, and its molecular and biochemical properties have been well characterized. However, the role of GAMYB elsewhere in the plant is not well understood. To investigate the molecular function of GAMYB outside of the aleurone cells, we isolated loss-of-function mutants from a panel of rice mutants produced by the insertion of a retrotransposon, Tos17. Through PCR screening using primers for rice GAMYB (OsGAMYB) and Tos17, we isolated three independent mutant alleles that contained Tos17 inserted in the exon region. No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function. We found no significant defects in the growth and development of the mutants at the vegetative stage. After the phase transition to the reproductive stage, however, shortened internodes and defects in floral organ development, especially a defect in pollen development, were observed. On the other hand, no difference was detected in flowering time. High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of alpha-amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development.
15208396	Heterogeneous expression patterns and separate roles of the SEPALLATA gene LEAFY HULL STERILE1 in grasses.	2004	Plant Cell	SEPALLATA (SEP) genes exhibit distinct patterns of expression and function in the grass species rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), suggesting that the role of the genes has changed during the evolution of the family. Here, we examine expression of the SEP-like gene LEAFY HULL STERILE1 (LHS1) in phylogenetically disparate grasses, reconstruct the pattern of gene expression evolution within the family, and then use the expression patterns to test hypotheses of gene function. Our data support a general role for LHS1 in specifying determinacy of the spikelet meristem and also in determining the identity of lemmas and paleas; these two functions are separable, as is the role of the gene in specifying floret meristems. We find no evidence that LHS1 determines flower number; it is strongly expressed in all spikelet meristems even as they are producing flowers, and expression is not correlated with eventual flower number. LHS1 expression in only the upper flowers of the spikelet appears to be the ancestral state; expression in all flowers is derived in subfamily Pooideae. LHS1 expression in pistils, stamens, and lodicules varies among the cereals. We hypothesize that LHS1 may have affected morphological diversification of grass inflorescences by mediating the expression of different floral identity genes in different regions of the floret and spikelet.
11027362	Rice dwarf mutant d1, which is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction.	2000	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, d1, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha). In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in d1 and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated. Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced. Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase. However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1. The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in d1 was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in d1. Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of d1. All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the GA-signaling pathway, namely the induction of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and internode elongation. In addition, a double mutant between d1 and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the D1, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling. However, the data also provide evidence for the presence of an alternative GA-signaling pathway that does not involve the Galpha protein. It is proposed that GA signaling via the Galpha protein may be more sensitive than that of the alternative pathway, as indicated by the low GA responsiveness of this Galpha-independent pathway.
11149940	Essential role of the small GTPase Rac in disease resistance of rice.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and a form of programmed cell death called hypersensitive response (HR) are often associated with disease resistance of plants. We have previously shown that the Rac homolog of rice, OsRac1, is a regulator of ROI production and cell death in rice. Here we show that the constitutively active OsRac1 (i) causes HR-like responses and greatly reduces disease lesions against a virulent race of the rice blast fungus; (ii) causes resistance against a virulent race of bacterial blight; and (iii) causes enhanced production of a phytoalexin and alters expression of defense-related genes. The dominant-negative OsRac1 suppresses elicitor-induced ROI production in transgenic cell cultures, and in plants suppresses the HR induced by the avirulent race of the fungus. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that OsRac1 has a general role in disease resistance of rice.
12237405	The heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit acts upstream of the small GTPase Rac in disease resistance of rice.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We used rice dwarf1 (d1) mutants lacking a single-copy Galpha gene and addressed Galpha's role in disease resistance. d1 mutants exhibited a highly reduced hypersensitive response to infection by an avirulent race of rice blast. Activation of PR gene expression in the leaves of the mutants infected with rice blast was delayed for 24 h relative to the wild type. H(2)O(2) production and PR gene expression induced by sphingolipid elicitors (SE) were strongly suppressed in d1 cell cultures. Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast. Galpha mRNA was induced by an avirulent race of rice blast and SE application on the leaf. These results indicated the role of Galpha in R gene-mediated disease resistance of rice. We have proposed a model for the defense signaling of rice in which the heterotrimeric G protein functions upstream of the small GTPase OsRac1 in the early steps of signaling.
12601171	Comparative analyses of genomic locations and race specificities of loci for quantitative resistance to Pyricularia grisea in rice and barley.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Comparative genomic analyses have revealed extensive colinearity in gene orders in distantly related taxa in mammals and grasses, which opened new horizons for evolutionary study. The objective of our study was to assess syntenic relationships of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disease resistance in cereals by using a model system in which rice and barley were used as the hosts and the blast fungus Pyricularia grisea Sacc. as the pathogen. In total, 12 QTL against three isolates were identified in rice; two had effects on all three isolates, and the other 10 had effects on only one or two of the three isolates. Twelve QTL for blast resistance were identified in barley; one had effect on all three isolates, and the other 11 had effects on only one or two of the three isolates. The observed isolate specificity led to a hypothesis about the durability of quantitative resistance commonly observed in many plant host-pathogen systems. Four pairs of the QTL showed corresponding map positions between rice and barley, two of the four QTL pairs had complete conserved isolate specificity, and another two QTL pairs had partial conserved isolate specificity. Such corresponding locations and conserved specificity suggested a common origin and conserved functionality of the genes underlying the QTL for quantitative resistance and may have utility in gene discovery, understanding the function of the genomes, and identifying the evolutionary forces that structured the organization of the grass genomes.
10934011	A role for the rice homeobox gene Oshox1 in provascular cell fate commitment.	2000	Development	The vascular tissues of plants form a network of interconnected cell files throughout the plant body. The transition from a genetically totipotent meristematic precursor to different stages of a committed procambial cell, and its subsequent differentiation into a mature vascular element, involves developmental events whose molecular nature is still mostly unknown. The rice protein Oshox1 is a member of the homeodomain leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Here we show that the strikingly precise onset of Oshox1 gene expression marks critical, early stages of provascular ontogenesis in which the developmental fate of procambial cells is specified but not yet stably determined. This suggests that the Oshox1 gene may be involved in the establishment of the conditions required to restrict the developmental potential of procambial cells. In support of this hypothesis, ectopic expression of Oshox1 in provascular cells that normally do not yet express this gene results in anticipation of procambial cell fate commitment, eventually culminating in premature vascular differentiation. Oshox1 represents the first example of a transcription factor whose function can be linked to specification events mediating provascular cell fate commitment.
11782419	A rice heterochronic mutant, mori1, is defective in the juvenile-adult phase change.	2002	Development	We have identified five recessive allelic mutations, mori1-1 to mori1-5, which drastically modify the shoot architecture of rice. The most remarkable feature of mori1 plants is a rapid production of small leaves and short branches. The mori1 plants are about 5 cm in height even 7 months after sowing. No reproductive growth was attained in mori1 plants even if inductive short-day treatment was applied. Leaves of mori1 at any position were very small and the size and shape were comparable to those of the wild-type 2nd leaf. The stem of mori1 7 months after sowing did not differentiate node and internode and had randomly oriented vascular bundles, which were characteristic of the basal part of the wild-type stem where 2nd and 3rd leaves were inserted. These structural characteristics indicate that mori1 maintains the 2nd-leaf stage (juvenile phase) of the wild type. The short plastochron and high cell division activity in the shoot apical meristem further confirmed the juvenility of mori1, corresponding to the 2nd-leaf-differentiation stage in the wild-type embryo. Furthermore, the apparent photosynthetic rate in mori1 leaves was low as in the wild-type 2nd leaf. Thus, mori1 is a heterochronic mutation that suppresses the induction of adult phase and the termination of the juvenile phase. Therefore, MORI1 plays an important role in the juvenile-adult phase change. The importance of heterochronic mutations in modifying shoot architecture is discussed.
12505996	The RADICLELESS1 gene is required for vascular pattern formation in rice.	2003	Development	The molecular mechanisms through which the complex patterns of plant vascular tissues are established are largely unknown. The highly ordered, yet simple, striate array of veins of rice leaves represents an attractive system to study the dynamics underlying pattern formation. Here we show that mutation in the RADICLELESS1 (RAL1) gene results in distinctive vascular pattern defects. In ral1 embryonic scutella, secondary veins are absent and in the prematurely aborted and discontinuous primary veins, cells are misaligned to each other. In ral1 leaves, longitudinal and commissural (transverse) veins display altered spacing and the commissural veins additionally show atypical branching and interruptions in their continuity. The vascular pattern alterations of ral1 occur in the context of normally shaped leaf primordia. Anatomical inspection and analysis of the expression of the procambium specification marker Oshox1-GUS and of the auxin-inducible reporter DR5-GUS demonstrates that all the vascular patterning aberrations of ral1 originate from defects in the procambium, which represents the earliest identifiable stage of vascular development. Furthermore, the ral1 mutant is unique in that procambium formation in leaf primordium development is delayed. Finally, the ral1 vascular patterning distortions are associated with a defective response to auxin and with an enhanced sensitivity to cytokinin. ral1 is the first mutant impaired in both procambium development and vascular patterning to be isolated in a monocot species.
12649483	Accumulation of phosphorylated repressor for gibberellin signaling in an F-box mutant.	2003	Science	Gibberellin (GA) regulates growth and development in plants. We isolated and characterized a rice GA-insensitive dwarf mutant, gid2. The GID2 gene encodes a putative F-box protein, which interacted with the rice Skp1 homolog in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In gid2, a repressor for GA signaling, SLR1, was highly accumulated in a phosphorylated form and GA increased its concentration, whereas SLR1 was rapidly degraded by GA through ubiquitination in the wild type. We conclude that GID2 is a positive regulator of GA signaling and that regulated degradation of SLR1 is initiated through GA-dependent phosphorylation and finalized by an SCF(GID2)-proteasome pathway.
12154129	Phytochrome mediates the external light signal to repress FT orthologs in photoperiodic flowering of rice.	2002	Genes Dev	Phytochromes confer the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of day-length recognition, we examined the interaction between phytochrome signals and circadian clocks in photoperiodic-flowering mutants of rice. Monitoring behaviors of circadian clocks revealed that phase setting of circadian clocks is not affected either under short-day (SD) or under long-day (LD) conditions in a phytochrome-deficient mutant that shows an early-flowering phenotype with no photoperiodic response. Non-24-hr-light/dark-cycle experiments revealed that a rice counterpart gene of Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO), named PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 1 (Heading date 1) [SE1 (Hd1)], functions as an output of circadian clocks. In addition, the phytochrome deficiency does not affect the diurnal mRNA expression of SE1 upon floral transition. Downstream floral switch genes were further identified with rice orthologs of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Our RT-PCR data indicate that phytochrome signals repress mRNA expression of FT orthologs, whereas SE1 can function to promote and suppress mRNA expression of the FT orthologs under SD and LD, respectively. This SE1 transcriptional activity may be posttranscriptionally regulated and may depend on the coincidence with Pfr phytochromes. We propose a model to explain how a short-day plant recognizes the day length in photoperiodic flowering.
15078816	Ehd1, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1.	2004	Genes Dev	Two evolutionarily distant plant species, rice (Oryza sativa L.), a short-day (SD) plant, and Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day plant, share a conserved genetic network controlling photoperiodic flowering. The orthologous floral regulators-rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO)-integrate circadian clock and external light signals into mRNA expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) group floral inducer. Here, we report that the rice Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene, which confers SD promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes a B-type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome. Ehd1 mRNA was induced by 1-wk SD treatment, and Ehd1 may promote flowering by inducing FT-like gene expression only under SD conditions. Microarray analysis further revealed a few MADS box genes downstream of Ehd1. Our results indicate that a novel two-component signaling cascade is integrated into the conserved pathway in the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice.
9670561	Aberrant splicing of intron 1 leads to the heterogeneous 5' UTR and decreased expression of waxy gene in rice cultivars of intermediate amylose content.	1998	Plant J	We have previously reported that three distinct patterns of waxy (Wx) gene transcript accumulation were present in 31 rice cultivars. The cultivars with high amylose content (group I) contain a 2.3 kb mature Wx mRNA, cultivars with intermediate amylose content (group II) produce both a 3.3 kb Wx pre-mRNA, which contains intron 1, and the 2.3 kb Wx mature mRNA, and cultivars with no amylose (group III) accumulate only the 3.3 kb Wx pre-mRNA. Analyses of the cDNAs reveals that four splice donor sites and three splice acceptor sites in intron 1 give rise to six splicing patterns in 2.3 kb Wx mRNA of group II cultivars. In addition, aberrant intron 1 excision causes either deletion of 4 or 5 nucleotides, or addition of 7 and 13 nucleotides at the junction of exon 1 and exon 2 of the 2.3 kb mRNA. In contrast, only one normal splicing pattern (one splice donor site and one splice acceptor site) was found in the 2.3 kb mRNA of group I cultivars. Nucleotide sequences of the Wx intron 1 in group I and group II cultivars differ by 16 individual bases. We suggest that these deletions or additions contribute to inefficient splicing of intron 1 from the 3.3 kb Wx pre-mRNA, as well as an aberrant splicing of the Wx intron 1 to produce the 2.3 kb mRNA with a heterogeneous 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR). As a consequence, the total amount of translatable Wx mRNA, and therefore the Wx protein and amylose content, are reduced in the group II cultivars compared with the group I cultivars.
9744101	A naturally occurring functional allele of the rice waxy locus has a GT to TT mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron.	1998	Plant J	In cultivated rice two wild-type alleles, Wxa and Wxb, predominate at the waxy locus, which encodes granule-bound starch synthase. The activity of Wxa is 10-fold higher than that of Wxb at the level of both protein and mRNA. Wxb has a +1G to T mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron. Sequence analysis of Wxb transcripts revealed that splicing occurs at the mutant AG/UU site and at two cryptic sites: the first is A/GUU, one base upstream of the original site and the second is AG/GU found approximately 100 bases upstream of the mutant splice site. We introduced single base mutations to the 5' splice sites of both Wxa and Wxb, fused with the gus reporter gene and introduced them into rice protoplasts. Analysis of GUS activities and transcripts indicated that a G to T mutation in Wxa reduced GUS activity and the level of spliced RNA. Conversely, a T to G mutation of Wxb restored GUS activity and the level of spliced RNA to that of wild-type Wxa. These results demonstrated that the low level expression of Wxb results from a single base mutation at the 5' splice site of the first intron. It is of interest that the Wxb allele of rice carrying the G to T mutation of intron 1 has been conserved in the history of rice cultivation because there is a low amylose content of the seed caused by this mutation.
9807819	Tissue localization of expansins in deepwater rice.	1998	Plant J	Expansins are a family of proteins capable of inducing stress relaxation of isolated cell walls. In earlier studies, we showed that the expression of expansin genes in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) is regulated by developmental, hormonal and environmental stimuli. Here, we describe the spatial distribution pattern of expansin transcripts and proteins in tissues and organs of deepwater rice using in situ mRNA hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. Expansin transcripts and proteins are present at high levels in the growing internodal epidermis, which has thick cell walls and acts, therefore, as a growth-limiting cell layer. Expansins are also concentrated in the differentiating vascular bundles of internodes. In the primary root, expansins are predominantly expressed in the tip region, particularly in the epidermis, differentiating vascular cylinder, and around the pericyle. Developing adventitious roots and lateral root primordia also contain high levels of expansin mRNA. In the shoot apex, expansin transcripts are abundant in the emerging leaf primordia. Our results indicate that expansins play an important role in the expansion and differentiation of plant tissues and organs.
10205906	Lesion mimic mutants of rice with alterations in early signaling events of defense.	1999	Plant J	We screened 93 lesion mimic mutants of rice for resistance to the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and found eight mutants that exhibited significant resistance to the fungus. We called these mutants cdr (cell death and resistance) and further analyzed three of them. Two mutations, cdr1 and cdr2, were recessive and one, Cdr3, was dominant. Many small brownish lesions developed over the entire leaf of the mutants 20-50 days after sowing. TUNEL staining revealed that DNA fragmentation occurred in leaf blade cells of the homozygous Cdr3 mutants. Autofluorescence and callose deposition were visible in leaf cells of these three mutants. Activation of two defense-related genes, PBZ1 and PR1, was observed in the leaves of the mutants; high expression of PBZ1 was correlated with the lesion formation in the three mutants, whereas PR1 was constitutively expressed in the cdr2 and Cdr3 mutants irrespective of the lesion formation. Levels of momilactone A, a major phytoalexin of rice, in these mutants were increased approximately 100-400-fold relative to the wild-type levels. Suspension-cultured cells of the cdr1 and cdr2 but not Cdr3 produced higher levels of H2O2 than the wild type when treated with calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. These results suggest that biochemical lesions of cdr1 and cdr2 lie in the early signaling steps leading to activation of the NADPH oxidase and that type-1 protein phosphatase is operative in protein dephosphorylation involved in NADPH oxidase activation.
10417713	RNA maturation of the rice SPK gene may involve trans-splicing.	1999	Plant J	A gene encoding a calcium-dependent seed-specific protein kinase (SPK) is abundantly expressed in developing rice seeds (Kawasaki, T et al. Gene (1993) 129, 183-189). Rice genomic clones encoding SPK were isolated using the entire cDNA fragment as a probe. Physical mapping of these genomic clones indicated that the genomic region corresponding to the entire cDNA was divided into two different regions, SPK-A and SPK-B, located on different rice chromosomes. The results of RACE-PCR analyses showed that the respective transcripts from SPK-A and SPK-B contained additional sequences which were not found in the SPK cDNA, and that these sequences were removed like introns during maturation of the SPK mRNA. These results suggest that two different RNAs were independently transcribed from SPK-A and SPK-B and joined, possibly by trans-splicing.
10571882	Short communication: developmental control of Xa21-mediated disease resistance in rice.	1999	Plant J	The rice resistance gene Xa21 confers resistance against the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The molecular genetic mechanism controlling the integration of the Xa21-mediated disease resistance response with the developmental program in rice is under study in this model system. Reproducible means of infecting plants at certain developmental stages were designed based on the timing of full expansion of the leaf. Xa21-resistance progressively increases from the susceptible juvenile leaf 2 stage through later stages, with 100% resistance at the adult leaf 9/10 stage. We found that Xa21 expression is independent of plant developmental stage, infection with Xoo, or wounding. Expression of the Xa21 gene transcript is not correlated with expression of Xa21 disease resistance indicating that the developmental regulation of Xa21-resistance is either controlled post-transcriptionally or by other factors.
10849355	Phytochromes confer the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (a short-day plant).	2000	Plant J	The photoperiodic sensitivity 5 (se5) mutant of rice, a short-day plant, has a very early flowering phenotype and is completely deficient in photoperiodic response. We have cloned the SE5 gene by candidate cloning and demonstrated that it encodes a putative heme oxygenase. Lack of responses of coleoptile elongation by light pulses and photoreversible phytochromes in crude extracts of se5 indicate that SE5 may function in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. Ectopic expression of SE5 cDNA by the CaMV 35S promoter restored the photoperiodic response in the se5 mutant. Our results indicate that phytochromes confer the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice. Comparison of se5 with hy1, a counterpart mutant of Arabidopsis, suggests distinct roles of phytochromes in the photoperiodic control of flowering in these two species.
10972871	dull: rice mutants with tissue-specific effects on the splicing of the waxy pre-mRNA.	2000	Plant J	In the endosperm of japonica rice, du-1 and du-2 mutations cause the reduction of amylose contents. It was previously shown that the Wx(b) allele of rice, which is predominantly distributed in japonica rice, has a mutation in the 5' splice site of intron 1 resulting in the creation of two weak 5' splice sites within exon 1. In du-1 and du-2 mutants, spliced Wx(b) transcripts were highly reduced, whereas the processing of transcripts derived from three other genes highly expressed in endosperm was not apparently influenced. Results of competitive RT-PCR analysis indicate that transcripts spliced at the two newly created 5' splice sites were equally affected in these two mutants. Genetic and molecular analyses of the effects of du-1 and du-2 on Wx(a) pre-mRNA with normal splice sites indicate that these two mutations do not affect the processing of Wx(a) pre-mRNA after splicing, suggesting that du-1 and du-2 are mutations of genes required for the efficient splicing of mutated Wx(b) pre-mRNA. Furthermore, du-1 and du-2 showed differential effects in endosperm and pollen. Although both mutations caused similar effects on the splicing of Wx(a) transcripts in endosperm, du-1 caused higher reduction of Wx(b) mRNA in pollen than in endosperm, while du-2 had a lesser effect in pollen than in endosperm. Based on these results, we propose that the du-1 and du-2 loci of rice encode tissue-specifically regulated splicing factors that are involved in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in rice.
12148532	Overexpression of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIS homologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice.	2002	Plant J	TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)-like genes play important roles in determining plant architecture, mainly by controlling the timing of phase transition. To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs. Constitutive overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1. In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed. The transgenic rice plants exhibited a more branched, denser panicle morphology. Detailed observation of the panicle structure revealed that the phase change from the branch shoot to the floral meristem state was also delayed, leading to the generation of higher-order panicle branches. These results suggest rice has a pathway that can respond to the overexpressed TFL1/CEN-like functions, and the molecular mechanisms controlling the phase transition of meristems are conserved between grass and dicot species, at least to some extent.
15509842	Characterization of a rice nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase gene OsRpoTp.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated and characterized two rice genes, OsRpoTp and OsRpoTm, that encode putative phage-type RNA polymerases. Predicted amino acid sequences showed high homology of these genes to known RpoT genes. A transient expression assay using green fluorescent protein indicated that the encoded proteins were localized to plastids and mitochondria, respectively. We demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR experiments and immunoblot analysis that OsRpoTp expression occurred at an early stage of leaf development, prior to the transcript accumulation of the genes that were transcribed by the nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (NEP). Expression analyses of the chloroplast-deficient rice mutant, virescent-1, showed a discrepancy between OsRpoTp protein accumulation and the level of transcripts of NEP-transcribed genes. Our results suggest that NEP activation is regulated by a process after transcription, and is affected by the developmental state of chloroplast biogenesis.
15356324	The virescent-2 mutation inhibits translation of plastid transcripts for the plastid genetic system at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice virescent-2 mutant (v(2)) is temperature conditional and develops chlorotic, chloroplast-deficient leaves at the restrictive temperature. In the v(2) mutant, plastid-encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid transcriptional regulation were not detectable at any time during chloroplast differentiation. However, the plastid transcripts for these two classes of proteins behaved differently in the mutant, with those for the plastid transcription/translation apparatus accumulating to wild-type levels and those for photosynthetic apparatus being suppressed. Polysome analysis showed that translation of the plastid transcripts encoding the plastid transcription/translation apparatus was blocked at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation. Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and OsSIG2A, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages. These results suggest that activation of the plastid translation machinery at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation is important for triggering the transmission of information about plastid developmental state to the nucleus, which in turn is required for the induction of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins at later stages of chloroplast differentiation.
14988485	Function, intracellular localization and the importance in salt tolerance of a vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	We examined the function and intracellular localization of the product of the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (OsNHX1) cloned from rice (Oryza sativa). OsNHX1 has the ability to suppress Na(+), Li(+) and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and sensitivity to a high K(+) concentration, a novel phenotype of the nhx1 mutants. Analysis using rice cells expressing a fusion protein of OsNHX1 and green fluorescent protein and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for OsNHX1 confirmed the localization of OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts. These results indicate that the OsNHX1 gene encodes a vacuolar (Na(+), K(+))/H(+) antiporter. Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots. In addition, overexpression of OsNHX1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic rice cells and plants. These results suggest that OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts plays important roles in the compartmentation of Na(+) and K(+) highly accumulated in the cytoplasm into the vacuoles, and the amount of the antiporter is one of the most important factors determining salt tolerance in rice.
15295073	Whole genome analysis of the OsGRF gene family encoding plant-specific putative transcription activators in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	OsGRF1 (Oryza sativa GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1) is a rice gene encoding a putative novel transcriptional regulator. We identified and characterized eleven homologs of OsGRF1 in the rice genome. All twelve OsGRF proteins have two highly conserved regions, the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains, and sequences reminiscent of transcription factors. OsGRF genes were preferentially expressed in young and growing tissues, and applied gibberellic acid (GA3) enhanced the expression of seven OsGRF genes. In situ hybridization showed high levels of OsGRF1 transcripts in the shoot apical meristem and in cells surrounding the vasculature of the intercalary meristem. In a GAL4-based yeast assay, the C-terminal region of OsGRF1 was found to have transactivation activity. These results indicate that OsGRF1 acts as a transcriptional activator. Based on the in situ expression pattern of OsGRF1, we postulate that it may be involved in regulating vegetative growth in rice.
10382970	Isolation and characterization of rice MADS box gene homologues and their RFLP mapping.	1999	DNA Res	Thirty-five MADS box gene homologues were identified through a large-scale cDNA analysis in rice. Based on the nucleotide sequences of the 3'-untranslated region, these clones were classified into 11 independent species. Seven species were found to be new among the rice MADS box gene family, and the other 4 corresponded to the previously reported OsMADS1, OsMADS2, OsMADS4, and OsMADS5. The full nucleotide sequences of the 7 new species were determined. Each clone encoded a deduced protein of 164-267 amino acids. The K-domain of the MADS protein was conserved in all clones though with lower degree in clone S10304. Reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that clones E31254 and E31864 were expressed mainly in panicles. Dendrogram analysis suggested that E31254 and E31864 are close to Arabidopsis AGL9 and AP1, respectively. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage mapping revealed that the rice MADS box gene homologues reported here are not clustered but are located throughout the genome. The locus of E31864 on the RFLP map was closely linked to the long sterile lemma gene, g-1.
12581301	Overexpression of Bax inhibitor suppresses the fungal elicitor-induced cell death in rice (Oryza sativa L) cells.	2003	Plant J	Treatment of suspension-cultured cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with cell wall extract of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) elicits a rapid generation of H2O2, alkalinization of culture medium, and eventual cell death. To elucidate genes involved in these processes, we exploited SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) technique for the molecular analysis of cell death in suspension-cultured cells treated with the elicitor. Among the downregulated genes in the elicitor-treated cells, a BI-1 gene coding for Bax inhibitor was identified. Transgenic rice cells overexpressing Arabidopsis BI-1 gene showed sustainable cell survival when challenged with M. grisea elicitor. Thus, the plant Bax inhibitor plays a functional role in regulating cell death in the rice cell culture system.
12581309	The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice.	2003	Plant J	Although the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is ultimately responsible for post-embryonic development in higher plants, lateral meristems also play an important role in determining the final morphology of the above-ground part. Axillary buds developing at the axils of leaves produce additional shoot systems, lateral branches. The rice TB1 gene (OsTB1) was first identified based on its sequence similarity with maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1), which is involved in lateral branching in maize. Both genes encode putative transcription factors carrying a basic helix-loop-helix type of DNA-binding motif, named the TCP domain. The genetic locus of OsTB1 suggested that OsTB1 is a real counterpart of maize TB1. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTB1 exhibited markedly reduced lateral branching without the propagation of axillary buds being affected. We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching. Expression of OsTB1, as examined with a putative promoter-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, was observed throughout the axillary bud, as well as the basal part of the shoot apical meristem, vascular tissues in the pith and the lamina joint. Taking these data together, we concluded that OsTB1 functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice, presumably through expression in axillary buds.
12581311	Structure and expression of the rice class-I type histone deacetylase genes OsHDAC1-3: OsHDAC1 overexpression in transgenic plants leads to increased growth rate and altered architecture.	2003	Plant J	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription. HDACs have been studied as negative regulators in eukaryotic transcription. We isolated the rice OsHDAC1-3 genes for class I-type histone deacetylases, which are related to the RPD3 family. The OsHDAC1 gene encoded a protein of approximately 57 kDa that shared 73.5, 72.7, 79.9, and 57.1% amino acid sequence identity with the OsHDAC2, OsHDAC3, maize RPD3, and human HDAC1 proteins, respectively. Genomic structures and Southern blot analyses revealed that OsHDAC1-3 contained seven, six, and seven exons, respectively, and constituted a class I-type family in the rice genome. OsHDAC1 was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity. To explore the role of histone deacetylases in transgenic plants, we inserted the OsHDAC1 cDNA fragment into the expression vector Ai::OsHDAC1 under the control of the ABA-inducible promoter Ai, and transformed the construct into rice. Levels of mRNA, protein, and HDAC activity were significantly increased in Ai::OsHDAC1 callus cells. The amount of tetra-acetylated H4 in the transgenic cells was greatly reduced, and the reduction was abolished upon treatment with trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that OsHDAC1 overexpression in transgenic cells both yields enzymatically active HDAC complexes and induces changes in histone acetylation in vivo. The overexpression leads to a range of novel phenotypes, involving increased growth rate and altered plant architecture, suggesting that OsHDAC1 functions in the genome-wide programming of gene expression.
12834406	Where do gibberellin biosynthesis and gibberellin signaling occur in rice plants?	2003	Plant J	To identify where gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and signaling occur, we analyzed the expression of four genes involved in GA biosynthesis, GA 20-oxidase1 and GA 20-oxidase2 (OsGA20ox1 and OsGA20ox2), and GA 3-oxidase1 and GA 3-oxidase2 (OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2), and two genes involved in GA signaling, namely, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (Galpha), and SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), which encodes a repressor of GA signaling. At the vegetative stage, the expression of OsGA20ox2, OsGA3ox2, Galpha, and SLR1 was observed in rapidly elongating or dividing organs and tissues, whereas the expression of OsGA20ox1 or OsGA3ox1 could not be detected. At the inflorescence or floral stage, the expression of OsGA20ox2, OsGA3ox2, Galpha, and SLR1 was also observed in the shoot meristems and stamen primordia. The overlapping expression of genes for GA biosynthesis and signaling indicates that in these tissues and organs, active GA biosynthesis occurs at the same site as does GA signaling. In contrast, no GA-biosynthesis genes were expressed in the aleurone cells of the endosperm; however, the two GA-signaling genes were actively expressed, indicating that the aleurone does not produce bioactive GAs, but can perceive GAs. The expression of OsGA20ox1 and OsGA3ox1 was observed only in the epithelium of the embryo and the tapetum of the anther. Based on the specific expression pattern of OsGA20ox1 and OsGA3ox1 in these tissues, we discuss the unique nature of the epithelium and the tapetum in terms of GA biosynthesis. The epithelium and the tapetum are considered to be an important source of bioactive GAs for aleurone and other organs of the flower, respectively.
12904206	Isolation and characterization of a rice WUSCHEL-type homeobox gene that is specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center in the root apical meristem.	2003	Plant J	The Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS) protein, which plays an important role in the specification of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), contains an 'atypical' homeodomain (HD) with extra residues in its loop and turn regions. We speculated that a WUS-type atypical HD protein might also be involved in the specification and maintenance of the root apical meristem (RAM) stem cells of rice. To investigate this possibility, we isolated and characterized a rice WUS-type homeobox gene designated quiescent-center-specific homeobox (QHB) gene. Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter-GUS and in situ hybridization, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of the root. During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the morphological differentiation of the root. However, we detected different QHB expression patterns in the process of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting that the cell-fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms. We also produced transformants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS. These transformants did not form crown roots, but developed multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the WUS-type homeobox gene is involved in the specification and maintenance of the stem cells (QC cells) in the RAM, by a mechanism similar to that for WUS in the SAM.
14535886	Increased tryptophan decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase activities induce Sekiguchi lesion formation in rice infected with Magnaporthe grisea.	2003	Plant J	Sekiguchi lesion (sl)-mutant rice infected with Magnaporthe grisea showed increased light-dependent tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities. TDC and MAO activities were observed before the penetration of M. grisea to rice cells and maintained high levels even after Sekiguchi lesion formation. Light-dependent expression of TDC gene was observed in leaves inoculated with M. grisea before Sekiguchi lesion formation. Spore germination fluid (SGF) of M. grisea also induced Sekiguchi lesion formation accompanied by increased enzymes activities and tryptamine accumulation. Sekiguchi lesion was also induced by treatments with tryptamine and beta-phenylethylamine, which are substrates for MAO, but was not induced by non-substrates such as indole-3-propionic acid, (+/-)-phenylethylamine and tryptophan under light. Light-dependent induction of Sekiguchi lesion by tryptamine was significantly inhibited in the presence of MAO inhibitors, metalaxyl and semicarbazide, and H2O2-scavengers, ascorbic acid and catalase. H2O2 in M. grisea-infected leaves with and without Sekiguchi lesions was demonstrated directly in situ by strong 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. On the other hand, H2O2 induced Sekiguchi lesions on leaves of cv. Sekiguchi-asahi under light, but not in darkness. This difference was associated with the decrease of catalase activity in infected leaves under light and the absence of decrease in darkness. We hypothesize that the H2O2-induced breakdown of cellular organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria in mesophyll cells may cause high TDC and MAO activities and the development of Sekiguchi lesion, and that the sl gene products in wild-type rice may function as a suppressor of organelle breakdown caused by chemical or environmental stress.
14617093	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron.	2003	Plant J	Nicotianamine (NA), a chelator of metals, is ubiquitously present in higher plants. In graminaceous plants, NA is a biosynthetic precursor of phytosiderophores and is thus a crucial component for iron (Fe) acquisition. Here, we show that three rice NA synthase (NAS) genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of Fe and that the three genes are differentially regulated by Fe. OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 transcripts were detected in Fe-sufficient roots but not in leaves, and levels of both increased markedly in both roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants. Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem. With Fe deficiency, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 expression extended to all root cells along with an increase in phytosiderophore secretion. In Fe-deficient plants, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in the vascular bundles of green leaves and in all cells of leaves showing severe chlorosis. OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status. These results strongly suggested that NAS and NA play an important role in long-distance transport of Fe in rice plants, in addition to their roles in phytosiderophore secretion from roots.
14756772	GID2, an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, specifically interacts with phosphorylated SLR1 protein and regulates the gibberellin-dependent degradation of SLR1 in rice.	2004	Plant J	The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) controls growth and development in plants. Previously, we identified a rice F-box protein, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2 (GID2), which is essential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation. In this study, we analyzed the biological and molecular biological properties of GID2. Expression of GID2 preferentially occurred in rice organs actively synthesizing GA. Domain analysis of GID2 revealed that the C-terminal regions were essential for the GID2 function, but not the N-terminal region. Yeast two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GID2 is a component of the SCF complex through an interaction with a rice ASK1 homolog, OsSkp15. Furthermore, an in vitro pull-down assay revealed that GID2 specifically interacted with the phosphorylated Slender Rice 1 (SLR1). Taken these results together, we conclude that the phosphorylated SLR1 is caught by the SCFGID2 complex through an interacting affinity between GID2 and phosphorylated SLR1, triggering the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SLR1.
15144377	Functional analyses of the flowering time gene OsMADS50, the putative SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20) ortholog in rice.	2004	Plant J	A late-flowering mutant was isolated from rice T-DNA-tagging lines. T-DNA had been integrated into the K-box region of Oryza sativa MADS50 (OsMADS50), which shares 50.6% amino acid identity with the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20). While overexpression of OsMADS50 caused extremely early flowering at the callus stage, OsMADS50 RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes of late flowering and an increase in the number of elongated internodes. This confirmed that the phenotypes observed in the knockout (KO) plants are because of the mutation in OsMADS50. RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of Hd1 and O. sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI). These results suggest that OsMADS50 is an important flowering activator that controls various floral regulators in rice.
15255870	OsYSL2 is a rice metal-nicotianamine transporter that is regulated by iron and expressed in the phloem.	2004	Plant J	We identified 18 putative yellow stripe 1 (YS1)-like genes (OsYSLs) in the rice genome that exhibited 36-76% sequence similarity to maize iron(III)-phytosiderophore transporter YS1. Of particular interest was OsYSL2, the transcripts of which were not detected in the roots of either iron-sufficient or iron-deficient plants, but dramatic expression was induced in the leaves by iron deficiency. Based on the nucleotide sequence, OsYSL2 was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 674 amino acids containing 14 putative transmembrane domains. OsYSL2:green fluorescent protein (GFP) was localized in the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells. Promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL2 was expressed in companion cells in iron-sufficient roots. GUS activity was increased in companion cells, but no GUS staining was observed in epidermal or cortex cells, even in iron-deficient roots. In the leaves and leaf sheaths of iron-sufficient rice, GUS staining was observed in phloem cells of the vascular bundles. In iron-deficient leaves, the OsYSL2 promoter was active in all tissues with particularly strong GUS activity evident in companion cells. The phloem-specific expression of the OsYSL2 promoter suggests that OsYSL2 is involved in the phloem transport of iron. Strong OsYSL2 promoter activity was also detected in developing seeds. Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL2 transported iron(II)-nicotianamine (NA) and manganese(II)-NA, but did not transport iron(III)-phyosiderophore. These results suggest that OsYSL2 is a rice metal-NA transporter that is responsible for the phloem transport of iron and manganese, including the translocation of iron and manganese into the grain.
15075394	An overview of gibberellin metabolism enzyme genes and their related mutants in rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	To enhance our understanding of GA metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa), we intensively screened and identified 29 candidate genes encoding the following GA metabolic enzymes using all available rice DNA databases: ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox). In contrast to the Arabidopsis genome, multiple CPS-like, KS-like, and KO-like genes were identified in the rice genome, most of which are contiguously arranged. We also identified 18 GA-deficient rice mutants at six different loci from rice mutant collections. Based on the mutant and expression analyses, we demonstrated that the enzymes catalyzing the early steps in the GA biosynthetic pathway (i.e. CPS, KS, KO, and KAO) are mainly encoded by single genes, while those for later steps (i.e. GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox) are encoded by gene families. The remaining CPS-like, KS-like, and KO-like genes were likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of diterpene phytoalexins rather than GAs because the expression of two CPS-like and three KS-like genes (OsCPS2, OsCPS4, OsKS4, OsKS7, and OsKS8) were increased by UV irradiation, and four of these genes (OsCPS2, OsCPS4, OsKS4, and OsKS7) were also induced by an elicitor treatment.
12700762	Adaptation of photoperiodic control pathways produces short-day flowering in rice.	2003	Nature	The photoperiodic control of flowering is one of the important developmental processes of plants because it is directly related to successful reproduction. Although the molecular genetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day (LD) plant, has provided models to explain the control of flowering time in this species, very little is known about its molecular mechanisms for short-day (SD) plants. Here we show how the photoperiodic control of flowering is regulated in rice, a SD plant. Overexpression of OsGI, an orthologue of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI) gene in transgenic rice, caused late flowering under both SD and LD conditions. Expression of the rice orthologue of the Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) gene was increased in the transgenic rice, whereas expression of the rice orthologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) was suppressed. Our results indicate that three key regulatory genes for the photoperiodic control of flowering are conserved between Arabidopsis, a LD plant, and rice, a SD plant, but regulation of the FT gene by CO was reversed, resulting in the suppression of flowering in rice under LD conditions.
15316288	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) semi-dwarf cultivar, Tan-Ginbozu (d35Tan-Ginbozu), contributed to the increase in crop productivity in Japan in the 1950s. Previous studies suggested that the semi-dwarf stature of d35Tan-Ginbozu is caused by a defective early step of gibberellin biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO). To study the molecular characteristics of d35Tan-Ginbozu, we isolated 5 KO-like (KOL) genes from the rice genome, which encoded proteins highly homologous to Arabidopsis and pumpkin KOs. The genes (OsKOL1 to 5) were arranged as tandem repeats in the same direction within a 120 kb sequence. Expression analysis revealed that OsKOL2 and OsKOL4 were actively transcribed in various organs, while OsKOL1 and OsKOL5 were expressed only at low levels; OsKOL3 may be a pseudogene. Sequence analysis and complementation experiments demonstrated that OsKOL2 corresponds to D35. Homozygote with null alleles of D35 showed a severe dwarf phenotype; therefore, d35Tan-Ginbozu is a weak allele of D35. Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis. OsKOL4 and OsKOL5 are likely to take part in phytoalexin biosynthesis, because their expression was promoted by UV irradiation and/or elicitor treatment. Comparing d35Tan-Ginbozu with other high yielding cultivars, we discuss strategies to produce culm architectures suitable for high crop yield by decreasing GA levels.
11536429	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice.	2001	Genesis	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages. Transgenic calli transferred onto regeneration medium began to display green spots, a sign of regeneration, but most of the transformants continued to propagate green spots at given stages. In the normal shoot-regeneration process of calli, expression of endogenous OSH1 was restricted in presumptive shoot-regenerating regions of calli and not observed in other areas. This restricted expression pattern should be required for further differentiation of the regenerating shoots. Thus our present results support the proposed function that KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes play a role in the formation and maintenance of the undetermined meristematic state of cells.
9869408	Identification of class B and class C floral organ identity genes from rice plants.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	The functions of two rice MADS-box genes were studied by the loss-of-function approach. The first gene, OsMADS4, shows a significant homology to members in the PISTILLATA (PI) family, which is required to specify petal and stamen identity. The second gene, OsMADS3, is highly homologous to the members in the AGAMOUS (AG) family that is essential for the normal development of the internal two whorls, the stamen and carpel, of the flower. These two rice MADS box cDNA clones were connected to the maize ubiquitin promoter in an antisense orientation and the fusion molecules were introduced to rice plants by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. Transgenic plants expressing antisense OsMADS4 displayed alterations of the second and third whorls. The second-whorl lodicules, which are equivalent to the petals of dicot plants in grasses, were altered into palea/lemma-like organs, and the third whorl stamens were changed to carpel-like organs. Loss-of-function analysis of OsMADS3 showed alterations in the third and fourth whorls. In the third whorl, the filaments of the transgenic plants were changed into thick and fleshy bodies, similar to lodicules. Rather than making a carpel, the fourth whorl produced several abnormal flowers. These phenotypes are similar to those of the agamous and plena mutants in Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, respectively. These results suggest that OsMADS4 belongs to the class B gene family and OsMADS3 belongs to the class C gene family of floral organ identity determination.
12407188	Hd3a, a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis FT gene, promotes transition to flowering downstream of Hd1 under short-day conditions.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	Heading date 3a (Hd3a) has been detected as a heading-date-related quantitative trait locus in a cross between rice cultivars Nipponbare and Kasalath. A previous study revealed that the Kasalath allele of Hd3a promotes heading under short-day (SD) conditions. High-resolution linkage mapping located the Hd3a locus in a approximately 20-kb genomic region. In this region, we found a candidate gene that shows high similarity to the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which promotes flowering in Arabidopsis: Introduction of the gene caused an early-heading phenotype in rice. The transcript levels of Hd3a were increased under SD conditions. The rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) gene, a homolog of CONSTANS (CO), has been shown to promote heading under SD conditions. By expression analysis, we showed that the amount of Hd3a mRNA is up-regulated by Hd1 under SD conditions, suggesting that Hd3a promotes heading under the control of Hd1. These results indicate that Hd3a encodes a protein closely related to Arabidopsis FT and that the function and regulatory relationship with Hd1 and CO, respectively, of Hd3a and FT are conserved between rice (an SD plant) and Arabidopsis (a long-day plant).
11237465	The LAX1 and FRIZZY PANICLE 2 genes determine the inflorescence architecture of rice by controlling rachis-branch and spikelet development.	2001	Dev Biol	We have analyzed two mutants that exhibit altered panicle architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In lax1-2, which is a new and stronger allele of the previously reported lax mutant, initiation and/or maintenance of rachis-branches, lateral spikelets, and terminal spikelets was severely prevented. In situ hybridization analysis using OSH1, a rice knotted1 (kn1) ortholog, confirmed the absence of lateral meristems in lax1-2 panicles. These defects indicate that the LAX1 gene is required for the initiation/maintenance of axillary meristems in the rice panicle. In addition to its role in forming lateral meristems, the wild-type LAX1 gene acts as a floral meristem identity gene which specifies the terminal spikelet meristem. A comparison of the defects in lax1-1 and lax1-2 plants suggested that the sensitivities to reduced LAX1 activity were not uniform among different types of meristems. In the fzp2 mutant panicle, the basic branching pattern of the panicle was indistinguishable from that of the wild type; however, specification of both terminal and lateral spikelet meristems was blocked, and sequential rounds of branching occurred at the point where the spikelet meristems are initiated in the wild-type panicle. This resulted in the generation of a panicle composed of excessive ramification of rachis-branches. The lax1-1 fzp2 double mutants exhibited a novel, basically additive, phenotype, which suggests that LAX1 and FZP2 function in genetically independent pathways.
8104574	Expression of a rice homeobox gene causes altered morphology of transgenic plants.	1993	Plant Cell	We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a homeobox sequence from rice. DNA sequence analysis of this clone, which was designated as Oryza sativa homeobox 1 (OSH1), and a genomic clone encoding the OSH1 sequence have shown that the OSH1 gene consists of five exons and encodes a polypeptide of 361 amino acid residues. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis has shown that OSH1 is a single-copy gene located near the phytochrome gene on chromosome 3. Introduction of the cloned OSH1 gene into rice resulted in altered leaf morphology, which was similar to that of the maize morphological mutant Knotted-1 (Kn1), indicating that OSH1 is a rice gene homologous to the maize Kn1 gene. RNA gel blot analysis has shown that the gene is primarily expressed in the shoot apices of young rice seedlings. This finding is supported by results of transformation experiments in which the 5' flanking region of the gene directed expression of a reporter gene in the shoot apex, particularly in stipules, of transgenic Arabidopsis. To elucidate the biological function of the OSH1 gene product, the coding region was introduced into Arabidopsis under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Almost all transformants showed abnormal morphology. The typical phenotype was the formation of clumps of abundant vegetative and reproductive shoot apices containing meristems and leaf primordia, which did not form elongated shoots. Some transformants with a less severe phenotype formed elongated shoots but had abnormally shaped leaves and flowers with stunted sepals, petals, and stamens. The abnormal phenotypes were inherited, and the level of expression of the introduced OSH1 correlates with the severity of the phenotype. These findings indicate that the abnormal morphologies of the transgenic plants are caused by the expression of the OSH1 gene product and, therefore, that OSH1 is related to the plant development process.
12427982	Isolation and characterization of a rice dwarf mutant with a defect in brassinosteroid biosynthesis.	2002	Plant Physiol	We have isolated a new recessive dwarf mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare). Under normal growth conditions, the mutant has very short leaf sheaths; has short, curled, and frizzled leaf blades; has few tillers; and is sterile. Longitudinal sections of the leaf sheaths revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis is reduced, which explains the short leaf sheaths. Transverse sections of the leaf blades revealed enlargement of the motor cells along the dorsal-ventral axis, which explains the curled and frizzled leaf blades. In addition, the number of crown roots was smaller and the growth of branch roots was weaker than those in the wild-type plant. Because exogenously supplied brassinolide considerably restored the normal phenotypes, we designated the mutant brassinosteroid-dependent 1 (brd1). Further, under darkness, brd1 showed constitutive photomorphogenesis. Quantitative analyses of endogenous sterols and brassinosteroids (BRs) indicated that BR-6-oxidase, a BR biosynthesis enzyme, would be defective. In fact, a 0.2-kb deletion was detected in the genomic region of OsBR6ox (a rice BR-6-oxidase gene) in the brd1 mutant. These results indicate that BRs are involved in many morphological and physiological processes in rice, including the elongation and unrolling of leaves, development of tillers, skotomorphogenesis, root differentiation, and reproductive growth, and that the defect of BR-6-oxidase caused the brd1 phenotype.
10753522	Overexpression of rice OSH genes induces ectopic shoots on leaf sheaths of transgenic rice plants.	2000	Dev Biol	Five rice homeobox (OSH) genes were overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the rice actin gene promoter in transgenic rice plants. Almost all of the transgenic plants showed abnormal phenotypes, which could be classified into three types according to their severity. Plants with the most severe phenotype formed only green organs, with many shoot apices on their adaxial sides. Plants with an intermediate phenotype formed bladeless leaves with normally developed leaf sheaths. Plants with a mild phenotype formed normal leaf sheaths and blades, but lacked ligules and showed diffusion of the blade-sheath boundary. The leaf structure of this phenotype was similar to that of dominant maize mutants, such as Kn1, Rs1, Lg3, and Lg4. Based on these phenotypes, we suggest that ectopic expression of the rice OSH genes interferes with the development of leaf blades and maintains leaves in less differentiated states. These results are discussed in relation to the leaf maturation schedule hypothesis (M. Freeling et al., 1992, BioEssays 14, 227-236).
15509765	The gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 regulates floral meristem size in rice and encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase orthologous to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1.	2004	Development	The regulation of floral organ number is closely associated with floral meristem size. Mutations in the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) cause enlargement of the floral meristem in Oryza sativa (rice), resulting in an increase in the number of all floral organs. Ectopic floral organs develop in the whorl of each organ and/or in the additional whorls that form. Inner floral organs are more severely affected than outer floral organs. Many carpel primordia develop indeterminately, and undifferentiated meristematic tissues remain in the center in almost-mature flowers. Consistent with this result, OSH1, a molecular marker of meristematic indeterminate cells in rice, continues to be expressed in this region. Although floral meristems are strongly affected by the fon1-2 mutation, vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal, even in this strong allele. We isolated the FON1 gene by positional cloning and found that it encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase most similar to CLAVATA1 (CLV1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This suggests that a pathway similar to the CLV signaling system that regulates meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis is conserved in the grass family. Unlike CLV1, which is predominantly expressed in the L3 layer of the shoot meristem, FON1 is expressed throughout the whole floral meristem, suggesting that small modifications to the CLV signaling pathway may be required to maintain the floral meristem in rice. In addition, FON1 transcripts are detected in all meristems responsible for development of the aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional redundancy with FON1 act in the vegetative and inflorescence meristems to mask the effects of the fon1 mutation.
11743085	Genetic control of flowering time in rice, a short-day plant.	2001	Plant Physiol	
15071728	Activation of a rice endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 in tissue culture is accompanied by cytosine demethylation and causes heritable alteration in methylation pattern of flanking genomic regions.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Tos17 is a copia-like, cryptic retrotransposon of rice, but can be activated by tissue culture. To study possible epigenetic mechanism controlling activity of Tos17, we subjected three rice lines (the parental line cv. Matsumae and two introgression lines, RZ2 and RZ35) that harbor different copies of the element to tissue culture. For each line, we investigated transcription and transposition of Tos17 in seed plants, calli and regenerated plants, cytosine-methylation status at CG and CNG positions within Tos17, effect of 5-azacytidine on methylation status and activity of Tos17, and cytosine-methylation states in genomic regions flanking original and some newly transposed copies of Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants. We found that only in introgression line RZ35 was Tos17 transcriptionally activated and temporarily mobilized by tissue culture, which was followed by repression before or upon plant regeneration. The activity and inactivity of Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants of RZ35 are accompanied by hypo- and hyper-CG methylation and hemi- and full CNG methylation, respectively, within the element, whereas immobilization of the element in the other two lines is concomitant with near-constant, full hypermethylation. Treatment with 5-azacytidine induced both CG and CNG partial hypomethylation of Tos17 in two lines (Matsumae and RZ35), which, however, was not accompanied by activation of Tos17 in any line. Heritable alteration in cytosine-methylation patterns occurred in three of seven genomic regions flanking Tos17 in calli and regenerated plants of RZ35, but in none of the five regions flanking dormant Tos17 in the other two lines.
15114474	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Norin-PL8 is a cold-tolerant variety of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that was developed by introgressing chromosomal segments from a cold-tolerant tropical japonica variety, Silewah, into a template japonica variety, Hokkai241. We previously identified two closely linked quantitative trait loci, Ctb1 and Ctb2, for cold tolerance at the booting stage of Norin-PL8 in the long arm of chromosome 4. We report here the physical mapping of Ctb1 and the identification of the candidate genes. A total of 2,008 segregating individuals were screened for recombination in the Ctb1 region by a PCR-based screening, and a series of near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed from progenies of recombinants. A comparison of the degrees of cold tolerance of the NILs indicated that Ctb1 is located in the 56-kb region covered by a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, OSJNBa0058 K23, that had been sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequence Project. We found seven open reading frames (ORFs) in the 56-kb region. Two ORFs encoded receptor-like protein kinases that are possibly involved in signal transduction pathways. Proteins that may be associated with a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were encoded by three ORFs, two of which encoded F-box proteins and one of which encoded a protein with a BAG domain. The other two ORFs encoded a protein with an OTU domain and an unknown protein. We were also able to show that Ctb1 is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage.
15088086	Analysis of T-DNA- Xa21 loci and bacterial blight resistance effects of the transgene Xa21 in transgenic rice.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	The genetic loci and phenotypic effects of the transgene Xa21, a bacterial blight (BB) resistance gene cloned from rice, were investigated in transgenic rice produced through an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. The flanking sequences of integrated T-DNAs were isolated from Xa21 transgenic rice lines using thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. Based on the analysis of 24 T-DNA- Xa21 flanking sequences, T-DNA loci in rice could be classified into three types: the typical T-DNA integration with the definite left and right borders, the T-DNA integration linked with the adjacent vector backbone sequences and the T-DNA integration involved in a complicated recombination in the flanking sequences. The T-DNA integration in rice was similar to that in dicotyledonous genomes but was significantly different from the integration produced through direct DNA transformation approaches. All three types of integrated transgene Xa21 could be stably inherited and expressed the BB resistance through derived generations in their respective transgenic lines. The flanking sequences of the typical T-DNA integration consisted of actual rice genomic DNA and could be used as probes to locate the transgene on the rice genetic map. A total of 15 different rice T-DNA flanking sequences were identified. They displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between two rice varieties, ZYQ8 and JX17, and were mapped on rice chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, respectively, by using a double haploid population derived from a cross between ZYQ8 and JX17. The blast search and homology comparison of the rice T-DNA flanking sequences with the rice chromosome-anchored sequence database confirmed the RFLP mapping results. On the basis of genetic mapping of the T-DNA- Xa21 loci, the BB resistance effects of the transgene Xa21 at different chromosome locations were investigated using homozygous transgenic lines with only one copy of the transgene. Among the transgenic lines, no obvious position effects of the transgene Xa21 were observed. In addition, the BB resistance levels of the Xa21 transgenic plants with different transgene copy numbers and on different genetic backgrounds were also investigated. It was observed that genetic background (or genome) effects were more obvious than dosage effects and position effects on the BB resistance level of the transgenic plants.
15105992	QTL mapping of grain quality traits from the interspecific cross Oryza sativa x O. glaberrima.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	International rice export markets are increasing demands for rapid improvements in grain quality characteristics. The African rice Oryza glaberrima is a new potential source of genes that will enhance the eating, cooking, and milling properties of the rice grain. The objective of this research was to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) among 312 doubled haploid lines derived from the BC3F1 of an interspecific cross of O. sativa x O. glaberrima. Genetic material was planted in replicated plots and evaluated for ten grain quality traits in 2001 in Colombia. A linkage map was constructed with 100 polymorphic microsatellite markers using the mapdisto software program to adjust for segregation distortion. Transgressive segregation was observed for all traits. Interval and composite interval analyses identified 27 QTLs for nine characters located on 11/12 chromosomes. The chromosomal positions of QTLs for percentage amylose, alkali-spreading score, and percentage protein were in agreement with data reported by others, whereas QTL markers for percentage head rice, percentage milled rice, percentage protein, and percentage brown rice were different in our mapping population. Five major QTLs were found to be associated with improved percentage rice bran, percentage amylose, and alkali-spreading score. Seven QTLs for improved percentage rice bran, percentage milled rice, alkali-spreading score, percentage protein, and grain length/width ratio were derived from the O. glaberrima accession. Three new QTLs for percentage rice bran are reported here for the first time. Results from this study suggest that the African rice might be a valuable new source for introgression and improvement of several traits that affect quality traits demanded by the different rice export markets.
15103410	Comparison of quantitative trait loci controlling seedling characteristics at two seedling stages using rice recombinant inbred lines.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	A better understanding of the genetics of seedling characteristics in rice could be helpful in improving rice varieties. Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the parents of Shanyou 63, an elite hybrid developed during the last decade in China, vary greatly with respect to their physiological and morphological traits at the seedling growth stage. In this study, we used a population of 240 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seedling characteristics. All plant material was grown in hydroponic culture. Data for the following characters were collected at 30 days and 40 days post-sowing: plant height, shoot dry matter weight (SDW), maximum root length, root dry weight (RDW), total dry weight, and root-shoot ratio (the ratio of SDW to RDW). Analysis using composite interval mapping detected 16 QTL for the six traits in 30-day-old seedlings. Of these 16 QTL, Minghui 63 alleles increased trait values at only two of them. The QTL in the vicinity of R3166 on chromosome 5 simultaneously influenced PH, SDW, MRL, RDW, and TDW in the same direction. Twenty QTL were detected for the same traits in the 40-day-old seedlings. However, at this stage Minghui 63 alleles increased trait values at eight QTL. The QTL linked to R3166 also affected PH, SDW, MRL, RDW, and TDW. Only four QTL were common to the two stages. These results clearly indicate that different genes (QTL) control the same traits during different time intervals. Zhenshan 97 alleles had positive effects during the first 30 days of seedling growth, but thereafter the positive effects of Minghui 63 alleles on seedling growth gradually became more pronounced.
10552425	Volatile components in stored rice [Oryza sativa (L.)] of varieties with and without lipoxygenase-3 in seeds.	1999	J Agric Food Chem	Lipoxygenase (LOX) is thought to play an important role in the formation of desirable or undesirable flavor and aroma in many plant products. In rice seeds, LOX activity is localized in the bran fraction and LOX-3 is the major isozyme component. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine whether the degree of staleness in the flavor of stored brown rice was related to the presence of LOX-3. We found that the amount of hexanal, pentanal, and pentanol in normal raw LOX-3 rice markedly increased during storage at 35 degrees C. That in LOX-3-less rice increased slightly but was a third to a fifth that of normal LOX-3 rice. In cooked rice, the amount of these components from glutinous rice exceeded that in nonglutinous rice, and that in normal LOX-3 rice exceeded that in LOX-3-less rice. These results indicate that the stale flavor production in LOX-3-less rice during storage is less than that in normal LOX-3 rice.
15221143	Quantitative trait loci for phyllochron and tillering in rice.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Morphogenetic processes in sequentially growing leaves and tiller buds are highly synchronized in rice ( Oryza sativa L.). Consequently, the appearance of successive leaves in the main tiller acts as the "pacemaker" for the whole shoot system development. The time interval between the appearance of successive leaves (days/leaf) in the main tiller is called the 'phyllochron'. The objectives of the investigation reported here were: (1) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control rice phyllochron and (2) to understand the roles of phyllochron QTLs as an underlying developmental factor for rice tillering. For this purpose we developed a set of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between IR36 ( indica) and Genjah Wangkal (tropical japonica). Composite interval mapping detected three phyllochron QTLs located on chromosomes 4, 10 and 11, where the presence of a Genjah Wangkal allele increased phyllochron. The largest QTL (on chromosome 4) was located on the genomic region syntenic to the vicinity of the maize Teopod 2 mutation, while the QTL on chromosome 10 was close to the rice plastochron 1 mutation. These three phyllochron QTLs failed to coincide with major tiller number QTLs. However, one tiller number QTL was associated with small LOD peaks for phyllochron and tiller-bud dormancy that were linked in coupling phase, suggesting that linked small effects of phyllochron and tiller-bud dormancy might result in a multiplicative effect on tiller number.
15375618	Phosphorus deficiency-induced root elongation and its QTL in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Theor Appl Genet	A significant level of root elongation was induced in rice (Oryza sativa) grown under phosphorus-deficient conditions. The root elongation clearly varied among a total of 62 varieties screened under two different phosphorus levels. Two contrasting varieties, 'Gimbozu', with a low elongating response and 'Kasalath', with a high elongating response, were chosen and crossed to produce a hybrid population for QTL analyses. QTLs for the phosphorus deficiency-induced root elongation were detected by two linkage maps, i.e., one with 82 F3 families constructed by 97 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tag site markers and another with 97 F8 lines by 790 amplified fragment length polymorphism and SSR markers. A single QTL for the elongation response was detected on chromosome 6, with a LOD score of 4.5 in both maps and explained about 20% of total phenotypic variance. In addition, this QTL itself, or a region tightly linked with it, partly explained an ability to reduce accumulation of excess iron in the shoots. The identified QTL will be useful to improve rice varieties against a complex nutritional disorder caused by phosphorus deficiency and iron toxicity.
15322754	Tagging and mapping of a rice gall midge resistance gene, Gm8, and development of SCARs for use in marker-aided selection and gene pyramiding.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), we have tagged and mapped Gm8, a gene conferring resistance to the rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae), a major insect pest of rice, onto rice chromosome 8. Using AFLPs, two fragments, AR257 and AS168, were identified that were linked to the resistant and susceptible phenotypes, respectively. Another resistant phenotype-specific marker, AP19(587), was also identified using RAPDs. SCAR primers based on the sequence of the fragments AR257 and AS168 failed to reveal polymorphism between the resistant and the susceptible parents. However, PCR using primers based on the regions flanking AR257 revealed polymorphism that was phenotype-specific. In contrast, PCR carried out using primers flanking the susceptible phenotype-associated fragment AS168 produced a monomorphic fragment. Restriction digestion of these monomorphic fragments revealed polymorphism between the susceptible and resistant parents. Nucleotide BLAST searches revealed that the three fragments show strong homology to rice PAC and BAC clones that formed a contig representing the short arm of chromosome 8. PCR amplification using the above-mentioned primers on a larger population, derived from a cross between two indica rice varieties, Jhitpiti (resistant parent) and TN1 (susceptible parent), showed that there is a tight linkage between the markers and the Gm8 locus. These markers, therefore, have potential for use in marker-aided selection and pyramiding of Gm8 along with other previously tagged gall midge resistance genes [ Gm2, Gm4(t), and Gm7].
15480535	Nucleotide polymorphism in the Adh1 locus region of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Nucleotide variation in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1) locus region of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon and its related species was analysed to clarify the maintenance mechanism of DNA variation in Oryza species. The estimated nucleotide diversity in the Adh1 locus region of O. rufipogon was 0.002, which was one of the lowest values detected in nuclear loci of plant species investigated so far. Tests of neutrality detected significantly negative deviation from the neutral mutation model for the coding region, especially for replacement sites. When each of the ADH1 domains was considered, significance was detected only for the catalytic domain 1. These results suggest purifying selection in the Adh1 coding region. In the phylogenetic tree of Oryza species based on Adh1 variation, cultivated rice O. sativa subspp. japonica and indica were included in the cluster of O. rufipogon. The genetic distance of the Adh1 region between O. rufipogon and O. sativa was as low as the nucleotide diversity of O. rufipogon. These results imply that O. rufipogon and O. sativa cannot be classified based on the nucleotide variation of Adh1. No replacement divergence between O. rufipogon and the other three A-genome species (O. glumaepatula, O. barthii and O. meridionalis) were detected, indicating that ADH1 is conserved in the A-genome species. On the other hand, between O. rufipogon and the E-genome species O. australiensis, replacement changes were detected only in the catalytic domain 1. The difference in replacement substitutions between the A- and E-genome species may be related to adaptive changes in the ADH1 domains, reflecting environmental differences where the species encounter anaerobic stress.
15278284	Identification of flanking SSR markers for a major rice gall midge resistance gene Gm1 and their validation.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Host-plant resistance is the preferred strategy for management of Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae), a serious pest in many rice-growing countries. The deployment of molecular markers linked to gall midge resistance genes in breeding programmes can accelerate the development of resistant cultivars. In the present study, we have tagged and mapped a dominant gall midge resistance gene, Gm1, from the Oryza sativa cv. W1263 on chromosome 9, using SSR markers. A progeny-tested F2 mapping population derived from the cross W1263/TN1 was used for analysis. To map the gene locus, initially a subset of the F2 mapping population consisting of 20 homozygous resistant and susceptible lines each was screened with 63 parental polymorphic SSR markers. The SSR markers RM316, RM444 and RM219, located on chromosome 9, are linked to Gm1 at genetic distances of 8.0, 4.9 and 5.9 cM, respectively, and flank the gene locus. Further, gene/marker order was also determined. The utility of the co-segregating SSR markers was tested in a backcross population derived from the cross Swarna/W1263//Swarna, and allelic profiles of these markers were analysed in a set of donor rice genotypes possessing Gm1 and in a few gall midge-susceptible, elite rice varieties.
15365628	QTLs for branching, floret formation, and pre-flowering floret abortion of rice panicle in a temperate japonica x tropical japonica cross.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	A large panicle with numerous florets is essential for improving rice ( Oryza sativa L.) yield. Rice panicle size is determined by such underlying morphogenetic processes as: (1) primary branch formation on the panicle axis; (2) floret formation on the primary branches (mainly determined by the secondary branch formation); and (3) pre-flowering abortion of florets in the panicle. We examined QTLs for these processes to understand how they are integrated into panicle size. We developed 106 backcross-inbred lines (BC1F4) from a cross between 'Akihikari' (a temperate japonica) and 'IRAT109' (a tropical japonica) and constructed a genetic map. One QTL detected on chromosome 2, with a large effect (R=0.30) on the number of florets per panicle, affected both primary branch formation on the panicle axis and floret formation on the primary branches. In addition, three QTLs that affect only one of these two processes were identified on chromosomes 4, 9, and 11, each having a subsidiary effect on the number of florets per panicle (R2=0.04-0.07). QTLs for pre-flowering floret abortion were detected at three different regions of the genome (chromosomes 1, 10, and 11). This is the first report on QTLs for pre-flowering floret abortion in grasses. The absence of a co-location between QTLs suggests that floret formation and abortion are not directly linked causally. These results demonstrate that studying the partitioning of panicle size into these underlying morphogenetic components would be helpful in understanding the complicated genetic control of panicle size.
15549232	Identification and characterization of a QTL on chromosome 2 for cytosolic glutamine synthetase content and panicle number in rice.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	A quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with the protein content of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1; EC 6.3.1.2) in senescing leaves, panicle number, and panicle weight was characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A near-isogenic line (NIL), C-22, developed by marker-assisted selection was grown under different nitrogen levels in the greenhouse and in a paddy field. Chromosome 2 of C-22 had an approximately 50-cM segment substituted from the Kasalath (indica) chromosome in a Koshihikari (japonica) genetic background. C-22 showed a 12-37% lower content of GS1 protein in leaf blades than Koshihikari, which was in good agreement with a QTL region positively affected by the japonica chromosome. At an early vegetative stage, C-22 had more active tillers than Koshihikari in the greenhouse. At the reproductive stage, both panicle number and total panicle weight of C-22 were significantly higher than those of Koshihikari, particularly when the plants were grown under a low-nitrogen condition. These traits of C-22 were further confirmed in a paddy field. Thus, tiller development was positively affected by the Kasalath chromosome at an early vegetative stage, which resulted in an increased panicle number and panicle weight at the mature stage in C-22. These data indicate that the target QTL (Pnn1; panicle number 1) is important in the development of tillers and panicles in rice. Linkage analyses for panicle number and ratio of developing tiller formation in the second axil (RDT) revealed that Pnn1 was delimited at the 6.7-cM region.
15551043	QTL detection for eating quality of cooked rice in a population of chromosome segment substitution lines.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	The genetic mechanism underlying six palatability properties of cooked rice and three physico-chemical traits was dissected in 66 BC(3)F(2) chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), using a complete linkage map in three successive years. The CSSLs showed transgressive segregation for all traits studied. Significant correlation was detected among most palatability traits. A total of 25 QTLs for the nine traits were identified on nine chromosomes, and many QTLs affecting different quality traits were mapped in the same regions. Six QTLs--qLT-8 for luster, qTD-6 and qTD-8 for tenderness, qIVOE-6 and qIVOE-8 for integrated value of organoleptic evaluation, and qAC-8 for amylose content--were repeatedly detected across the 3 years. Phenotypic values were significantly different between the recurrent parent, cultivar Asominori, and the CSSLs harboring any of the six QTL alleles across the three environments, indicating that these six QTLs were non-environment-specific and could be used for marker-assisted selection in rice quality improvement.
15549231	High-resolution genetic mapping at the Bph15 locus for brown planthopper resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Resistance to the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stal, a devastating sucking insect pest of rice, is an important breeding objective in rice improvement programs. Bph15, one of the 17 major BPH resistance genes so far identified in both cultivated and wild rice, has been identified in an introgression line, B5, and mapped on chromosome 4 flanked by restriction fragment length polymorphism markers C820 and S11182. In order to pave the way for positional cloning of this gene, we have developed a high-resolution genetic map of Bph15 by positioning 21 DNA markers in the target chromosomal region. Mapping was based on a PCR-based screening of 9,472 F(2) individuals derived from a cross between RI93, a selected recombinant inbred line of B5 bearing the resistance gene Bph15, and a susceptible variety, Taichung Native 1, in order to identify recombinant plants within the Bph15 region. Recombinant F(2) individuals with the Bph15 genotype were determined by phenotype evaluation. Analysis of recombination events in the Bph15 region delimited the gene locus to an interval between markers RG1 and RG2 that co-segregated with the M1 marker. A genomic library of B5 was screened using these markers, and bacterial artificial chromosome clones spanning the Bph15 chromosome region were obtained. An assay of the recombinants using the sub-clones of these clones in combination with sequence analysis delimited the Bph15 gene to a genomic segment of approximately 47 kb. This result should serve as the basis for eventual isolation of the Bph15 resistance gene.
15672255	Genetic dissection of embryo sac fertility, pollen fertility, and their contributions to spikelet fertility of intersubspecific hybrids in rice.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	The partial sterility of hybrids has been a major barrier for utilization of the strong heterosis expressed in hybrids between Oryza sativa ssp. indica and O. sativa ssp. japonica. Wide-compatibility varieties, comprising a special class of germplasm, are able to produce fertile hybrids when crossed to both indica and japonica varieties. However, all the work on wide compatibility and majority of studies on indica/japonica hybrid sterility reported so far were based only on spikelet fertility; thus, it is not known to what extent male and female gamete abortions influence hybrid sterility. In this study, we investigated pollen fertility, embryo sac fertility, and spikelet fertility in an F1 population of 202 true hybrid plants derived from a three-way cross ('02428'/'Nanjing 11'//'Balilla'). A partial regression analysis showed that the pollen and embryo sac fertility contributed almost equally to spikelet fertility. QTL analysis based on a linkage map of 191 polymorphic marker loci identified two QTLs for pollen fertility, one QTL for embryo sac fertility, and three QTLs for spikelet fertility. The S5 locus, previously identified as a locus for wide compatibility by spikelet fertility analysis, is a major locus for embryo sac fertility, and a QTL on chromosome 5 had a major effect on pollen fertility. These two loci coincided with the two major QTLs for spikelet fertility. The study also detected a QTL on chromosome 8, showing a large effect on spikelet fertility but no effect on either pollen or embryo sac fertility. Very little interaction among the QTLs was detected. The implications of the findings in rice breeding programs are discussed.
15549230	Epistasis underlying female sterility detected in hybrid breakdown in a Japonica-Indica cross of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Epistasis is considered to be a primary genetic basis of hybrid breakdown. We found novel epistatic genes causing hybrid breakdown in an intraspecific cross of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). F2 progeny derived from a cross between a Japonica variety, Asominori, and an Indica variety, IR24, showed segregation of high sterility for seeds, even though the reciprocal F1 hybrids showed about 60% seed fertility. Backcross populations (BC3F2, BC3F3), obtained from repeated backcrossing with Asominori, showed the segregation of causal genes in a simple Mendelian fashion. Using these populations, we identified that this sterility was hybrid breakdown caused by interaction among three nuclear genes distributed on the both parental genomes. These new genes, designated as hsa1, hsa2, and hsa3, were found to be involved in female gamete development by histological examination. The Indica parent IR24 has a sterile allele, hsa1-IR, which was located at near RFLP marker G148 on chromosome 12, whereas the Japonica parent Asominori has two sterile alleles, hsa2-As on chromosome 8 (close to G104) and hsa3-As on chromosome 9 (close to RM285). Female gametes carrying the hsa1-IR, hsa2-As, and hsa3-As alleles aborted in hsa1-IR homozygous plant, leading to seed sterility and selective elimination of the specific allelic combination. This study provides direct evidence that hybrid breakdown is attributed to epistatic interaction of genes from both parents and suggests that complicated mechanisms has been developed for hybrid breakdown during the evolution of rice.
15647921	Gene actions of QTLs affecting several agronomic traits resolved in a recombinant inbred rice population and two backcross populations.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	To understand the types of gene action controlling seven quantitative traits in rice, we carried out quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in order to distinguish between the main-effect QTLs (M-QTLs) and digenic epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) responsible for the trait performance of 254 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from rice varieties Lemont/Teqing and two backcross hybrid (BCF1) populations derived from these RILs. We identified 44 M-QTL and 95 E-QTL pairs in the RI and BCF1 populations as having significant effects on the mean values and mid-parental heterosis of heading date, plant height, flag leaf length, flag leaf width, panicle length, spikelet number and spikelet fertility. The E-QTLs detected collectively explained a larger portion of the total phenotypic variation than the M-QTLs in both the RI and BCF1 populations. In both BCF1 populations, over-dominant (or under-dominant) loci were more important than additive and complete or partially dominant loci for M-QTLs and E-QTL pairs, thereby supporting prior findings that overdominance resulting from epistatic loci are the primary genetic basis of inbreeding depression and heterosis in rice.
15723276	Flowering response of rice to photoperiod and temperature: a QTL analysis using a phenological model.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	In this study we have attempted to quantify the thermal and photoperiodical responses of rice (Oryza sativa L.) flowering time QTLs jointly by a 'date-of-planting' field experiment of a mapping population, and a 'phenological model' analysis that separately parameterizes the two responses, based on daily temperature, daily photoperiod and flowering date. For this purpose, the 'three-stage Beta model', which parameterizes the sensitivity to temperature (parameter alpha), the sensitivity to photoperiod (parameter beta), and earliness under optimal conditions (10 h photoperiod at 30 degrees C) (parameter G), was applied to 'Nipponbare' x 'Kasalath' backcross inbred lines that were transplanted on five dates. QTLs for the beta value were detected in the four known flowering time QTL (Hd1, Hd2, Hd6 and Hd8) regions, while QTLs for the G value were detected only in the Hd1 and Hd2 regions. This result was consistent with previous reports on near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Hd1, Hd2 and Hd6, where these loci were involved in photoperiod sensitivity, and where Hd1 and Hd2 conferred altered flowering under both 10 and 14 h photoperiods, while Hd6 action was only affected by the 14 h photoperiod. Hd8 was shown to control photoperiod sensitivity for the first time. Interestingly, Hd1 and Hd2 were associated with a QTL for the alpha value, which might support the previous hypothesis that the process of photoinduction depends on temperature. These results demonstrate that our approach can effectively quantify environmental responses of flowering time QTLs without controlled environments or NILs.
15782297	Genetic analysis of adaptive syndromes interrelated with seed dormancy in weedy rice (Oryza sativa).	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Seed dormancy in rice interrelates to the weedy characteristics shattering, awn, black hull color, and red pericarp color. A cross between the weedy strain SS18-2 and the breeding line EM93-1 was developed to investigate the genetic basis and adaptive significance of these interrelationships. These characteristics or their components differed in average degree of dominance from -0.8 to 1.5, in heritability from 0.5 to 0.96, and in their contribution to phenotypic or genotypic variation in dormancy by up to 25%. Five dormancy, four shattering, and three awn-length quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in the BC1 population replicated in 2 years. Two QTLs for hull color were identified, and the SS18-2-derived and EM93-1-derived alleles increased the intensity of black, and red or yellow pigmentations, respectively. The only QTL for pericarp color co-located with the red pericarp gene Rc, with the SS18-2-derived allele increasing the intensity of black and red pigmentations. Four of the five dormancy QTLs were flanked or bracketed by one to four QTLs for the interrelated characteristics. The QTL organization pattern indicates the central role of seed dormancy in adaptive syndromes for non-domesticated plants, implies that the elimination of dormancy from cultivars could arise from the selections against multiple interrelated characteristics, and challenges the use of dormancy genes at these loci in breeding varieties for resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). However, another QTL (qSD12) provides candidate gene(s) for PHS resistance because it has a large effect in the population and it is independent of the loci for interrelated characteristics.
15765224	QTL-based analysis of leaf senescence in an indica/japonica hybrid in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Theor Appl Genet	In order to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for leaf senescence and related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we developed two backcross populations, indica/japonica// japonica and indica/japonica//indica, using IR36 as the indica parent and Nekken-2 as the japonica parent. The QTLs were mapped using a set of simple sequence-repeat markers (SSRs) in the BC(1)F(1) population. Senescence was characterized in these plants by measuring the leaf chlorophyll content 25 days after flowering (DAF), the reduction in chlorophyll content (the difference between the chlorophyll content at flowering and at 25 DAF), and the number of late-discoloring leaves per panicle at 25 DAF in five plants from each BC(1)F(2) line. These plants were moved into a temperature-controlled growth cabinet at the time of flowering and allowed to mature under identical conditions. Eleven QTLs were detected in the two populations. The major of QTLs for senescence were found on the short arm of chromosome 6 and on the long arm of chromosome 9. Of these, one QTL on chromosome 6 and two on chromosome 9 were verified by confirming the effects of the genotypes on the phenotypes of the BC(1)F(3) lines. The japonica parent was found to contribute to late senescence at all but one QTL. Based on a comparison of the effects of heterozygotes and homozygotes on the phenotypic values of each QTL genotype, we concluded that the differential senescence observed in the indica-japonica hybrid was not due to over-dominance; rather, it was the result of partial-dominance genes that were donated from either of the parents.
15765223	QTL mapping of root traits in a doubled haploid population from a cross between upland and lowland japonica rice in three environments.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	To genetically dissect drought resistance associated with japonica upland rice, we evaluated a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross between two japonica cultivars for seven root traits under three different growing conditions (upland, lowland and upland in PVC pipe). The traits included basal root thickness (BRT), total root number (RN), maximum root length (MRL), root fresh weight (RFW), root dry weight (RDW), ratio of root fresh weight to shoot fresh weight (RFW/SFW) and ratio of root dry weight to shoot dry weight (RDW/SDW). The BRT was significantly correlated with the index of drought resistance, which was defined as the ratio of yield under the stress of the upland condition to that under the normal lowland condition. A complete genetic linkage map with 165 molecular markers covering 1,535 cM was constructed. Seven additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 15 pairs of epistatic loci for BRT and RN were identified under upland and lowland conditions, and 12 additive QTLs and 17 pairs of epistatic QTLs for BRT, RN, MRL, RFW, RFW/SFW and RDW/SDW were identified under the PVC pipe condition. Four additive QTLs and one pair of epistatic QTLs controlling IDR were also found. These QTLs individually explained up to 25.6% of the phenotypic variance. QTL x environment (Q x E) interactions were detected for all root traits, and the contributions of these interactions ranged from 1.1% to 19.9%. Five co-localized QTLs controlling RFW and RDW, RFW/SFW, RDW/SDW and IDR, BRT and RN, RN, MRL and IDR were found. Four types of QTLs governing BRT and RN were classified by their detection in the upland and lowland conditions. Some common QTLs for root traits across different backgrounds were also revealed. These co-localized QTLs and common QTLs will facilitate marker-assisted selection for root traits in rice breeding programs.
11683269	Identification of an 85-kb DNA fragment containing pms1, a locus for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility in rice.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile rice has a number of desirable characteristics for hybrid rice production. Previous studies identified pms1, located on chromosome 7, as a major locus for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility. The objective of this study was to localize the pms1 locus to a specific DNA fragment by genetic and physical mapping. Using 240 highly sterile individuals and a random sample of 599 individuals from an F2 population of over 5000 individuals from a cross between Minghui 63 and 32001S, we localized the pms1 locus by molecular marker analysis to a genetic interval of about 4 cM, 0.25 cM from RG477 on one side and 3.8 cM from R1807 on the other side. A contig map composed of seven BAC clones spanning approximate 500 kb in length was constructed for the pms1 region by screening a BAC library of Minghui 63 DNA using RFLP markers and chromosomal walking. Analysis of recombination events in the pms1 region among the highly sterile individuals reduced the length of the contig map to three BAC clones. Sequencing of one BAC clone, 2109, identified two SSR markers located 85 kb apart in the clone that flanked the pms1 locus on both sides, as indicated by the distribution of recombination events. We thus concluded that the pms1 locus was located on the fragment bounded by the two SSR markers.
15247409	The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	Using a two-element iAc/Ds transposon-tagging system, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility. Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence. Type 1 spikelets (approximately 25%) were sterile due to a failure in accumulation of starch in pollen grains. Type 2 spikelets (approximately 55%) had viable pollen grains, but anthers failed to dehisce and/or synchronize with anthesis due to failure in septum degradation and stomium breakage, resulting in sterility. Type 3 spikelets (approximately 20%) had normal fertility. In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type. The Ds insertion responsible for the aid1 mutation was mapped within the coding region of the AID1 gene on chromosome 6, which is predicted to encode a novel protein of 426 amino acids with a single MYB domain. The MYB domain of AID1 is closely related to that of the telomere-binding proteins of human, mouse, and Arabidopsis, and of single MYB domain transcriptional regulators in plants such as PcMYB1 and ZmIBP1. AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants.
7580252	A novel class of MADS box genes is involved in ovule development in petunia.	1995	Plant Cell	We isolated and characterized two ovule-specific MADS box cDNAs from petunia, designated floral binding protein (fbp) genes 7 and 11. The putative protein products of these genes have approximately 90% of their overall amino acid sequence in common. In situ RNA hybridization experiments revealed that both genes are expressed in the center of the developing gynoecium before ovule primordia are visible. At later developmental stages, hybridization signals were observed only in the ovules, suggesting that these genes are involved in ovule formation. To test this hypothesis, we raised transgenic petunia plants in which both fbp7 and fbp11 expression was inhibited by cosuppression. In the ovary of these transformants, spaghetti-shaped structures developed in positions normally occupied by ovules. These abnormal structures morphologically and functionally resemble style and stigma tissues. Our results show that these MADS box genes belong to a new class of MADS box genes involved in proper ovule development in petunia.
10465023	Cell genealogies in a plant meristem deduced with the aid of a 'bootstrap' L-system.	1994	Cell Prolif	The primary root meristem of maize (Zea mays L.) contains longitudinal files of cells arranged in groups of familial descent (sisters, cousins, etc.). These groups, or packets, show ordered sequences of cell division which are transverse with respect to the apico-basal axis of the root. The sequences have been analysed in three zones of the meristem during the course of the first four cell generations following germination. In this period, the number of cells in the packets increases from one to 16. Theoretically, there are 48 possible division pathways that lead to the eight-cell stage, and nearly 2 x 10(6) that lead to the 16-cell stage. However, analysis shows that only a few of all the possible pathways are used in any particular zone of the root. This restriction of pathways results from inherited sequences of asymmetric cell divisions which lead to sister cells of unequal length. All possible division pathways can be generated by deterministic 'bootstrap' L-systems which assign different lifespans to sister cells of successive generations and hence specify their subsequent sequence of divisions. These systems simulate propagating patterns of cell divisions which agree with those actually found within the growing packets that comprise the root meristem. The patterns of division are specific to cells originating in various regions of the meristem of the germinating root. The importance of such systems is that they simulate patterns of cellular proliferation where there is ancestral dependency. They can therefore be applied in other growing and proliferating systems where this is suspected.
12667868	The genetic colinearity of rice and other cereals on the basis of genomic sequence analysis.	2003	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Small segments of rice genome sequence have been compared with that of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and with several closer relatives, including the cereals maize, rice, sorghum, barley and wheat. The rice genome is relatively stable relative to those of other grasses. Nevertheless, comparisons with other cereals have demonstrated that the DNA between cereal genes is highly variable and evolves rapidly. Genic regions have undergone many more small rearrangements than have been revealed by recombinational mapping studies. Tandem gene duplication/deletion is particularly common, but other types of deletions, inversions and translocations also occur. The many thousands of small genic rearrangements within the rice genome complicate but do not negate its use as a model for larger cereal genomes.
9121560	An atypical topoisomerase II from Archaea with implications for meiotic recombination.	1997	Nature	Type II topoisomerases help regulate DNA topology during transcription, replication and recombination by catalysing DNA strand transfer through transient double-stranded breaks. All type II topoisomerases described so far are members of a single protein family. We have cloned and sequenced the genes encoding the A and B subunits of topoisomerase II from the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae. This enzyme is the first of a new family. It has no similarity with other type II topoisomerases, except for three motifs in the B subunit probably involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. We also found these motifs in proteins of the Hsp90 and MutL families. The A subunit has similarities with four proteins of unknown function. One of them, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spo11 protein, is required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Mutagenesis, performed on SPO11, of the single tyrosine conserved between the five homologues shows that this amino acid is essential for Spo11 activity. By analogy with the mechanism of action of known type II topoisomerases, we suggest that Spo11 catalyses the formation of double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae.
11858837	Establishment of polarity in angiosperm lateral organs.	2002	Trends Genet	In seed plants, lateral organs such as leaves and floral organs are formed from the flanks of apical meristems. Therefore, they have an inherent positional relationship: organ primordia have an adaxial side next to the meristem, and an abaxial one away from the meristem. Surgical and genetic studies suggest that a morphogenetic gradient, which originates in the meristem, converts the inherent polarity into a functional one. Once an adaxial-abaxial axis of polarity is established within organ primordia, it provides cues for proper lamina growth and asymmetrical development. Several key participants in this process have been identified, and analyses of these genes support and refine our views of axis formation in plants. The complex relationships between and within various members of these plant-specific gene families (class III HD-ZIPs, YABBYs and KANADIs) might account for a substantial part of the morphological variation in lateral organs of seed plants.
9291958	Alien introgression in rice.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity is affected by several biotic and abiotic stresses. The genetic variability for some of these stresses is limited in the cultivated rice germplasm. Moreover, changes in insect biotypes and disease races are a continuing threat to increased rice production. There is thus an urgent need to broaden the rice gene pool by introgressing genes for such traits from diverse sources. The wild species of Oryza representing AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG and HHJJ genomes are an important reservoir of useful genes. However, low crossability and limited recombination between chromosomes of cultivated and wild species limit the transfer of such genes. AT IRRI, a series of hybrids and monosomic alien addition lines have been produced through embryo rescue following hybridization between rice and several distantly related species. Cytoplasmic male sterility and genes for resistance to grassy stunt virus and bacterial blight have been transferred from A genome wild species into rice. Similarly, genes for resistance to brown planthopper, bacterial blight and blast have also been introgressed across crossability barriers from distanly related species into rice. Some of the introgressed genes have been mapped via linkage to molecular markers. One of the genes Xa-21 introgressed from O. longistaminata has been cloned and physically mapped on chromosome 11 of rice using BAC library and flourescence in-situ hybridization. RFLP analysis revealed introgression from 11 of the 12 chromosomes of C genome species into rice. Introgression has also been obtained from other distant genomes (EE, FF, GG) into rice and in majority of the cases one or two RFLP markers were introgressed. Reciprocal replacement of RFLP alleles of wild species with the alleles of O. sativa indicates alien gene transfer through crossing over. The rapid recovery of recurrent phenotypes in BC2 and BC3 generations from wide crosses is an indication of limited recombination. Further cytogenetic and molecular investigations are required to determine precisely the mechanism of introgression of small chromosome segments from distant genomes in the face of limited homoeologous chromosome pairing. Future research should focus on enhancing recombination between homoeologous chromosomes. Introgression of QTL from wild species should be attempted to increase the yield potential of rice.
11163166	Development of leaf shape.	2001	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Variation among vascular plants in the initiation and patterning of leaves results in a diverse array of leaf shape, including the strap-like leaf of many grasses and the broad lamina of most eudicots. Recent findings highlight the importance of interactions between the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and developing leaf primordia in axis specification and the establishment of leaf shape. Global regulators of epigenetic states have been implicated in these interactions and may play a role in distinguishing founder cells and stem cells within the SAM.
12456752	Dissecting plant meiosis using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants.	2003	J Exp Bot	Meiosis is a key stage in the life cycle of all sexually reproducing eukaryotes. In plants, specialized reproductive cells differentiate from somatic tissue. These cells then undergo a single round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of chromosome division to produce haploid cells that then undergo further rounds of mitotic division to produce the pollen grain and embryo sac. A detailed cytological description of meiosis has been built up over many years, based on studies in a wide range of plants. Until recently, comparable molecular studies have proved too challenging, however, a number of groups are beginning to use Arabidopsis thaliana to overcome this problem. A range of meiotic mutants affecting key stages in meiosis have been identified using a combination of screening for plants exhibiting reduced fertility and, more recently, using a reverse genetics approach. These are now providing the means to identify and characterize the activity of key meiotic genes in flowering plants.
1715520	The war of the whorls: genetic interactions controlling flower development.	1991	Nature	The analysis of mutations affecting flower structure has led to the identification of some of the genes that direct flower development. Cloning of these genes has allowed the formulation of molecular models of how floral meristem and organ identity may be specified, and has shown that the distantly related flowering plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus use homologous mechanisms in floral pattern formation.
8535139	The petunia MADS box gene FBP11 determines ovule identity.	1995	Plant Cell	In contrast to the wealth of information relating to genes regulating floral meristem and floral organ identity, only limited data are available concerning genes that are involved in determining and regulating the identity and development of an ovule. We have recently isolated the floral binding protein 11 (FBP11) MADS box gene from petunia and found that it is expressed exclusively in ovule primordia and subsequently in the ovules, suggesting a role for this gene in ovule formation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a recombinant gene in which the full-size FBP11 cDNA was placed under the control of a strong cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Transgenic petunia plants expressing this chimeric gene have ovulelike structures on the adaxial side of the sepals and the abaxial side of the petals. Detailed morphological studies showed that these ovulelike structures are true ovules. RNA gel blot analysis was performed to investigate ectopic FBP11 expression in relation to the expression of the closely related FBP7 gene and the putative petunia class C-type homeotic genes FBP6 and pMADS3. Our results indicate that FBP11 represents an ovule identity gene. A new model describing the mode of action of FBP11 as an additional class D MADS box gene is presented.
8756724	The SCARECROW gene regulates an asymmetric cell division that is essential for generating the radial organization of the Arabidopsis root.	1996	Cell	In the Arabidopsis root meristem, initial cells undergo asymmetric divisions to generate the cell lineages of the root. The scarecrow mutation results in roots that are missing one cell layer owing to the disruption of an asymmetric division that normally generates cortex and endodermis. Tissue-specific markers indicate that a heterogeneous cell type is formed in the mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of SCARECROW (SCR) suggests that it is a member of a novel family of putative transcription factors. SCR is expressed in the cortex/endodermal initial cells and in the endodermal cell lineage. Tissue-specific expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. These results indicate a key role for SCR in regulating the radial organization of the root.
12395189	Ovule-specific MADS-box proteins have conserved protein-protein interactions in monocot and dicot plants.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	OsMADS13 is a rice MADS-box gene that is specifically expressed in developing ovules. The amino acid sequence of OsMADS13 shows 74% similarity to those of FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 7 (FBP7) and FBP11, the products of two MADS-box genes that are necessary and sufficient to determine ovule identity in Petunia. To assess whether OsMADS13, the putative rice ortholog of FBP7 and FBP11, has an equivalent function, several analyses were performed. Ectopic expression of FBP7 and FBP11 in Petunia results in ectopic ovule formation on sepals and petals. Here we show that ectopic expression of OsMADS13 in rice and Arabidopsis does not result in the formation of such structures. Furthermore, ectopic expression of FBP7 and FBP11 in Arabidopsis also fails to induce ectopic ovule formation. To determine whether protein-protein interactions involving putative class D MADS-box proteins have been conserved, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed. These experiments resulted in the identification of three putative partners of OsMADS13, all of them encoded by AGL2-like genes. Interestingly the Petunia FBP7 protein also interacts with AGL2-like proteins. The evolutionary conservation of the MADS-box protein partners of these ovule-specific factors was confirmed by exchange experiments which showed that the protein partners of OsMADS13 interact with FBP7 and vice versa.
1516751	A conceptual framework for maize leaf development.	1992	Dev Biol	What is and is not known about the maize leaf is reviewed. Analysis of genetic mosaics and direct observation with the SEM have broken leaf development into three distinct phases: recruitment of cells within the meristem, cell division into the 0.6-mm tall primordium, and postprimordial division and differentiation into the mature leaf. New data are presented that imply that cell division rates in the leaf are coordinated by inductive signals from the internal cells. Leaf cells that tend to divide more are held in check by slower growing neighbors; this complicates the search for developmental compartments. Experiments with recessive mutants that remove the ligule and auricle have been important in identifying an inducer signal with the specific meaning "make ligule-auricle." We have studied many dominant mutant alleles at seven different genes. Each mutant alters the position of the ligule boundary. We conclude the following. First, the mutants act in particular domains of the primordium. Second, the dominant mutants all move the ligule boundary in the same direction. Third, the mutants all retard developmental stage transitions. Fourth, three and probably four of the seven genes for which dominant mutants have been studied specify homeodomain proteins in the wrong place. The concept of "maturation schedule" is used to explain these data. All of the dominant mutant phenotypes are seen as consequences of immature cells being in the wrong place when inductive signals pass through the leaf. Several specific questions of leaf development and especially questions as to source of inductive signals or homologies among juvenile and adult organ parts are recast in light of this "maturation schedule" hypothesis.
1596272	Maize mutants and variants altering developmental time and their heterochronic interactions.	1992	Bioessays	It is useful to envision two fundamentally different ways by which the timing of plant development is regulated: developmental stage-transition mechanisms and time-to-flowering mechanisms. The existence of both mechanisms is indicated by the behavior of various mutants. Shoot stage transitions are defined by dominant mutants representing at least four different genes; each mutant retards transitions from juvenile shoot stages to more adult shoot stages. In addition, dominant leaf stage-transition mutants in at least seven different genes have similar phenotypes, but the leaf rather than the shoot is the focus (and at least two of these genes encode homeodomain proteins.) One mutant, Hairy sheath frayed 1-O (Hsf1-O) simultaneously affects shoot and leaf; this mutant's behavior initiated our interest in plant heterochronism. The second type of timekeeping involves time-to-flowering. As with most plant but not animal species, cultivars of the maize species vary greatly for the time-to-flowering quantitative trait: between 6 and 14 weeks is common. It is via the 'slipping time frames' interaction that takes place between stage-transition mutants and time-to-flowering genetic backgrounds that unexpected and radical phenotypes occur. We see a reservoir of previously unsuspected morphological possibilities among the few heterochronic genotypes we have constructed, possibilities that may mimic the sort of variation needed to fuel macroevolution without having to posit (as done by Goldschmidt) any special macromutational mechanisms.
15012225	GENETIC ANALYSIS OF OVULE DEVELOPMENT.	1998	Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol	Ovules are the direct precursors of seeds and thus play central roles in sexual plant reproduction and human nutrition. Extensive classical studies have elucidated the evolutionary trends and developmental processes responsible for the current wide variety of ovule morphologies. Recently, ovules have been perceived as an attractive system for the study of genetic regulation of plant development. More than a dozen regulatory genes have now been identified through isolation of ovule mutants. Characterization of these mutants shows that some aspects of ovule development follow independent pathways, while other processes are interdependent. Some of these mutants have ovules resembling those of putative ancestors of angiosperms and may help in understanding plant evolution. Clones of several of the regulatory genes have been used to determine expression patterns and putative biochemical functions of the gene products. Newly constructed models of genetic regulation of ovule development provide a framework for interpretation of future discoveries.

9599420	The molecular and genetic basis of ovule and megagametophyte development.	1998	Semin Cell Dev Biol	The formation of ovules is a key step in the plant life cycle which alternates between a diploid and haploid generation, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. The transitions between the two generations in the female occur in the ovule, the site of meiosis, female gametogenesis and double fertilization. The intimate association of sporophytic and gametophytic tissues in the ovule allows an investigation of their cellular interactions during ovule and seed development. In Arabidopsis, several sporophytically acting loci which primarily affect the morphogenesis of the integuments have been identified. Early acting genes may respond to positional information leading to a region-specific initiation of morphogenesis, whereas later acting genes affect cellular aspects of integument growth. Much less is known about the mechanisms controlling the development of the megagametophyte. Comparative morphology and genetic analyses suggests that regulatory mechanisms ensure a tight coordination of independently controlled cellular processes with cell specification and differentiation.
12244261	Female Gametophyte Development in Maize: Microtubular Organization and Embryo Sac Polarity.	1994	Plant Cell	The developmental stages of the maize embryo sac were correlated with the corresponding silk lengths of ear florets in the female inflorescence. The development of embryo sacs in the ovules of spikes occurs in a gradient pattern with the initiation of the embryo sac beginning at the base of the ear and progressing to the top. At the beginning of meiosis, the presence of conspicuous cortical microtubules coincides with the extensive elongation of the megasporocyte. The spindles at metaphase I and II align along the long axis of the megasporocyte leading to the linear alignment of the dyad and tetrad of megaspores. During megagametogenesis, micropylar and chalazal nuclei of the embryo sac undergo synchronized divisions and migration at the second and third mitosis. Radiate perinuclear microtubules are present during the interphase of the second and third mitosis, and inter-sister nuclear microtubules occur at the late four-nucleate embryo sac. The configuration and orientation of the spindles, phragmoplasts, and pairs of nuclei result in precise positioning of the nuclei. The fusion of the polar nuclei and the formation of a microtubule organizing center-like structure in the filiform apparatus occur right after the first division of the antipodal cells. The different patterns of organization of microtubules in the cells of the mature embryo sac reflect their structural adaptations for their future function.
9039264	Meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breaks are catalyzed by Spo11, a member of a widely conserved protein family.	1997	Cell	Meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs). In certain mutants, breaks accumulate with a covalently attached protein, suggesting that cleavage is catalyzed by the DSB-associated protein via a topoisomerase-like transesterase mechanism. We have purified these protein-DNA complexes and identified the protein as Spo11, one of several proteins required for DSB formation. These findings strongly implicate Spo11 as the catalytic subunit of the meiotic DNA cleavage activity. This is the first identification of a biochemical function for any of the gene products involved in DSB formation. Spo11 defines a protein family with other members in fission yeast, nematodes, and archaebacteria. The S. pombe homolog, rec12p, is also known to be required for meiotic recombination. Thus, these findings provide direct evidence that the mechanism of meiotic recombination initiation is evolutionarily conserved.
15356393	Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OsCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	The T-DNA gene-trap system has been efficiently used to elucidate gene functions in plants. We report here a functional analysis of a cysteine protease gene, OsCP1, isolated from a pool of T-DNA insertional rice. GUS assay with the T-DNA tagged line indicated that the OsCP1 promoter was highly active in the rice anther. Sequence analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of OsCP1 was homologous to those of papain family cysteine proteases containing the highly conserved interspersed amino acid motif, ERFNIN. This result suggested that the gene encodes a cysteine protease in rice. We also identified a suppressed mutant from T2 progeny of the T-DNA tagged line. The mutant showed a significant defect in pollen development. Taken together, the results demonstrated that OsCP1 is a cysteine protease gene that might play an important role in pollen development.
9876176	The PINHEAD/ZWILLE gene acts pleiotropically in Arabidopsis development and has overlapping functions with the ARGONAUTE1 gene.	1999	Development	Several lines of evidence indicate that the adaxial leaf domain possesses a unique competence to form shoot apical meristems. Factors required for this competence are expected to cause a defect in shoot apical meristem formation when inactivated and to be expressed or active preferentially in the adaxial leaf domain. PINHEAD, a member of a family of proteins that includes the translation factor eIF2C, is required for reliable formation of primary and axillary shoot apical meristems. In addition to high-level expression in the vasculature, we find that low-level PINHEAD expression defines a novel domain of positional identity in the plant. This domain consists of adaxial leaf primordia and the meristem. These findings suggest that the PINHEAD gene product may be a component of a hypothetical meristem forming competence factor. We also describe defects in floral organ number and shape, as well as aberrant embryo and ovule development associated with pinhead mutants, thus elaborating on the role of PINHEAD in Arabidopsis development. In addition, we find that embryos doubly mutant for PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1, a related, ubiquitously expressed family member, fail to progress to bilateral symmetry and do not accumulate the SHOOT MERISTEMLESS protein. Therefore PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1 together act to allow wild-type growth and gene expression patterns during embryogenesis.
9006065	Organization and cell differentiation in lateral roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.	1997	Development	Lateral root formation in plants involves the stimulation of mature pericycle cells to proliferate and redifferentiate to create a new organ. The simple organization of the root of Arabidopsis thaliana allows the development of lateral root primordia to be characterized histologically. We have divided the process of lateral root development into 8 stages defined by specific anatomical characteristics and cell divisions. To identify the cell types in the developing primordium we have generated a collection of marker lines that express beta-glucuronidase in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner in the root. Using these tools we have constructed a model describing the lineage of each cell type in the lateral root. These studies show that organization and cell differentiation in the lateral root primordia precede the appearance of a lateral root meristem, with differential gene expression apparent after the first set of divisions of the pericycle.
10318768	Homologous chromosome pairing in wheat.	1999	J Cell Sci	Bread wheat is a hexaploid (AABBDD, 2n=6x=42) containing three related ancestral genomes, each having 7 chromosomes, giving 42 chromosomes in diploid cells. During meiosis true homologues are correctly associated in wild-type wheat, but a degree of association of related chromosomes (homoeologues) occurs in a mutant (ph1b). We show that the centromeres are associated in non-homologous pairs in all floral tissues studied, both in wild-type wheat and the ph1b mutant. The non-homologous centromere associations then become homologous premeiotically in wild-type wheat in both meiocytes and the tapetal cells, but not in the mutant. In wild-type wheat, the homologues are colocalised along their length at this stage, but the telomeres remain distinct. A single telomere cluster (bouquet) is formed in the meiocytes only by the onset of leptotene. The sub-telomeric regions of the homologues associate as the telomere cluster forms. The homologous associations at the telomeres and centromeres are maintained through meiotic prophase, although, during leptotene, the two homologues and also the sister chromatids within each homologue are separate along the rest of their length. As meiosis progresses, first the sister chromatids and then the homologues associate intimately. In wild-type wheat, first the centromere grouping, then the bouquet disperse by the end of zygotene.
11166572	The Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases: a non-identical twin relationship.	2001	Trends Biochem Sci	A double-strand break in genomic DNA that remains unrepaired can be lethal for a cell. Indeed, the integrity of the genome is paramount for survival. It is therefore surprising that some cells deliberately introduce double-strand breaks at certain times during their life cycle. Why might they do this? What are the benefits? How are these breaks repaired? The answers to these questions lie in understanding the basis of meiotic recombination, the process that leads to genetic variation. This review summarizes the key roles played by the two recombinases, Dmc1 and Rad51, in the faithful repair of DNA breaks.

12783800	The meiotic protein SWI1 is required for axial element formation and recombination initiation in Arabidopsis.	2003	Development	We report the detailed characterization of SWITCH1 (SWI1) an Arabidopsis thaliana protein that has been linked with the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. Using a combination of cytological methods including immunolocalization of meiotic chromosome-associated proteins we show that SWI1 is required for formation of axial elements. Our studies reveal that the swi1-2 mutation prevents the formation of RAD51 foci during meiotic prophase and suppresses the chromosome fragmentation phenotype of the recombination-defective dif1-1 mutant. Together, these data suggest that SWI1 may be required for meiotic recombination initiation. Finally we raised an antibody against SWI1 and showed, by immunolocalization coupled with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation experiments, that SWI1 is expressed exclusively in meiotic G(1) and S phase. Thus, SWI1 appears to be required for early meiotic events that are at the crossroad of sister chromatid cohesion, recombination and axial element formation. The possible inter-relationship between these processes and the function of SWI1 are discussed.

14758540	An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	To elucidate the genetic system that establishes homologous chromosome pairing in monocot plants, we have isolated an asynaptic mutant of rice, designated pair2 (homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 2), in which 24 completely unpaired univalents are observed at pachytene and diakinesis. The mutation was caused by an insertion of the retrotransposon Tos17, as demonstrated by complementation of the mutation by transformation with the corresponding wild-type gene. The gene in which the element was inserted is orthologous to the ASY1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and the HOP1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mature PAIR2 mRNA and several splicing variants were found to be highly expressed in wild-type reproductive tissues, and lower expression was also detected in vegetative tissues. In situ hybridization and BrdU incorporation experiments revealed that PAIR2 expression is specifically enhanced in male and female meiocytes, but not in those at pre-meiotic S phase or in the pollen maturation stages. The results obtained in this study suggest that the PAIR2 gene is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis, as in the case of the genes ASY1 and HOP1. The study also suggested the possibility that a highly homologous copy of the PAIR2 gene located on a different chromosome is in fact a pseudogene.
10712951	International Rice Genome Sequencing Project: the effort to completely sequence the rice genome.	2000	Curr Opin Plant Biol	The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) involves researchers from ten countries who are working to completely and accurately sequence the rice genome within a short period. Sequencing uses a map-based clone-by-clone shotgun strategy; shared bacterial artificial chromosome/P1-derived artificial chromosome libraries have been constructed from Oryza sativa ssp. japonica variety 'Nipponbare'. End-sequencing, fingerprinting and marker-aided PCR screening are being used to make sequence-ready contigs. Annotated sequences are immediately released for public use and are made available with supplemental information at each IRGSP member's website. The IRGSP works to promote the development of rice and cereal genomics in addition to producing genome sequence data.
12750344	The SHOOTLESS2 and SHOOTLESS1 genes are involved in both initiation and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem through regulating the number of indeterminate cells.	2003	Genetics	To characterize the SHL2 and SHL1 genes in detail, we analyzed three strains carrying weak alleles of SHL2, shl2-6, shl2-7, and shl2-8, and one weak allele of SHL1, shl1-3. In contrast to strong alleles, which result in lack of shoot meristem, strains bearing these weak alleles formed shoot meristem frequently during embryogenesis. In shl2-6 and shl2-7 mutants, the meristem was lost during seed development. Only the shl2-8 mutant could survive after germination, but it showed abnormal initiation pattern and morphology of leaves. In strains bearing the weak alleles, the shoot meristem was composed of a small number of indeterminate cells and ultimately converted into leaf primordium. The shl1-3 mutant showed phenotypes similar to those of shl2-8. Thus SHL2 and SHL1 are required for both initiation and maintenance of shoot meristem. In shl2 mutants, there was a positive correlation between the size of the expression domain of OSH1 representing the number of indeterminate cells, the frequency of shoot meristem initiation, and the duration of meristem survival. Thus the shoot meristem will not initiate in an "all-or-nothing" fashion, but is formed in various degrees depending on the strength of the alleles. Double-mutant analyses indicate that SHL2 functions upstream of SHO to establish proper organization of the shoot meristem.
10679452	Developmental complexities of simple leaves.	2000	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Recent papers have explored early events in the development of simple leaves. Functional compartmentalization of the shoot apical meristem correlates with distinct fields of cells connected by plasmodesmata. Molecules important in the initiation of phyllotactic pattern are described and the relationship between dorsoventral patterning and lateral leaf expansion is investigated.

2152125	Early flower development in Arabidopsis.	1990	Plant Cell	The early development of the flower of Arabidopsis thaliana is described from initiation until the opening of the bud. The morphogenesis, growth rate, and surface structure of floral organs were recorded in detail using scanning electron microscopy. Flower development has been divided into 12 stages using a series of landmark events. Stage 1 begins with the initiation of a floral buttress on the flank of the apical meristem. Stage 2 commences when the flower primordium becomes separate from the meristem. Sepal primordia then arise (stage 3) and grow to overlie the primordium (stage 4). Petal and stamen primordia appear next (stage 5) and are soon enclosed by the sepals (stage 6). During stage 6, petal primordia grow slowly, whereas stamen primordia enlarge more rapidly. Stage 7 begins when the medial stamens become stalked. These soon develop locules (stage 8). A long stage 9 then commences with the petal primordia becoming stalked. During this stage all organs lengthen rapidly. This includes the gynoecium, which commences growth as an open-ended tube during stage 6. When the petals reach the length of the lateral stamens, stage 10 begins. Stigmatic papillae appear soon after (stage 11), and the petals rapidly reach the height of the medial stamens (stage 12). This final stage ends when the 1-millimeter-long bud opens. Under our growing conditions 1.9 buds were initiated per day on average, and they took 13.25 days to progress through the 12 stages from initiation until opening.
8970728	Acquisition of identity in the developing leaf.	1996	Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol	Leaves are produced repeatedly from the shoot apical meristem of plants. Molecular and cellular evidence show that identity of the leaf and its parts is acquired progressively and that the underlying process changes as the leaf matures. The relative importance of cell lineage compared with a position-dependent model for specifying cell fates is discussed.
9043079	Phase change and the regulation of trichome distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana.	1997	Development	Higher plants pass through several phases of shoot growth during which they may produce morphologically distinct vegetative structures. In Arabidopsis thaliana this phenomenon is apparent in the distribution of trichomes on the leaf surface. Leaves produced early in rosette development lack trichomes on their abaxial (lower) surface, leaves produced later have trichomes on both surfaces, and leaves in the inflorescence (bracts) may have few or no trichomes on their adaxial (upper) surface. Here we describe some of the factors that regulate this distribution pattern. We found that the timing of abaxial trichome production and the extent to which bracts lack adaxial trichomes varies in different ecotypes. The production of abaxial trichomes appears to be regulated by the age, rather than the size of the plant. This conclusion is based on the observation that mutations that affect either the rate (altered meristem programming1) or onset (paused) of leaf initiation respectively increase or decrease the number of leaves that lack abaxial trichomes, but have only a minor effect on the time at which the first leaf with abaxial trichomes is produced. The production of abaxial trichomes is coordinated with the reproductive development of the shoot as this trait is delayed by photoperiodic conditions and some mutations that delay flowering. The loss of adaxial trichomes is likely to be a consequence of floral induction, and is accelerated by terminal flower1-10, a mutation that accelerates inflorescence development. We demonstrate that gibberellins promote trichome production in Arabidopsis and present evidence indicating that abaxial trichome production is regulated by both the level of a trichome inducer and the competence of the abaxial epidermis to respond to this inducer.
11201746	Pre-meiotic S phase is linked to reductional chromosome segregation and recombination.	2001	Nature	Meiosis is initiated from G1 of the cell cycle and is characterized by a pre-meiotic S phase followed by two successive nuclear divisions. The first of these, meiosis I, differs from mitosis in having a reductional pattern of chromosome segregation. Here we show that meiosis can be initiated from G2 in fission yeast cells by ectopically activating the meiosis-inducing network. The subsequent meiosis I occurs without a pre-meiotic S phase and with decreased recombination, and exhibits a mitotic pattern of equational chromosome segregation. The subsequent meiosis II results in random chromosome segregation. This behaviour is similar to that observed in cells lacking the meiotic cohesin Rec8 (refs 3, 4), which becomes associated with chromosomes at G1/S phase, including the inner centromere, a region that is probably critical for sister-centromere orientation. If the expression of Rec8 is delayed to S phase/G2, then the centromeres behave equationally. We propose that the presence of Rec8 in chromatin is required at the pre-meiotic S phase to construct centromeres that behave reductionally and chromosome arms capable of a high level of recombination, and that this explains why meiosis is initiated from G1 of the cell cycle.

10631180	Molecular analysis of SCARECROW function reveals a radial patterning mechanism common to root and shoot.	2000	Development	Mutation of the SCARECROW (SCR) gene results in a radial pattern defect, loss of a ground tissue layer, in the root. Analysis of the shoot phenotype of scr mutants revealed that both hypocotyl and shoot inflorescence also have a radial pattern defect, loss of a normal starch sheath layer, and consequently are unable to sense gravity in the shoot. Analogous to its expression in the endodermis of the root, SCR is expressed in the starch sheath of the hypocotyl and inflorescence stem. The SCR expression pattern in leaf bundle sheath cells and root quiescent center cells led to the identification of additional phenotypic defects in these tissues. SCR expression in a pin-formed mutant background suggested the possible origins of the starch sheath in the shoot inflorescence. Analysis of SCR expression and the mutant phenotype from the earliest stages of embryogenesis revealed a tight correlation between defective cell divisions and SCR expression in cells that contribute to ground tissue radial patterning in both embryonic root and shoot. Our data provides evidence that the same molecular mechanism regulates the radial patterning of ground tissue in both root and shoot during embryogenesis as well as postembryonically.

Various mutants and strains expressing phenotypic and physiological variations provide an indispensable source for functional analysis of genes. In this review, we cover almost all of the rice mutants found to date and the variant strains that are important in developmental, physiological and agronomical studies. Mutants and genes showing defects in vegetative organs, i.e. leaf, culm and root, inflorescence reproductive organ and seeds with an embryo and endosperm are described with regards to their phenotypic and molecular characteristics. A variety of alleles detected by quantitative trait locus analysis, such as heading date, disease/insect resistance and stress tolerance, are also shown.
12791992	In-depth view of structure, activity, and evolution of rice chromosome 10.	2003	Science	Rice is the world's most important food crop and a model for cereal research. At 430 megabases in size, its genome is the most compact of the cereals. We report the sequence of chromosome 10, the smallest of the 12 rice chromosomes (22.4 megabases), which contains 3471 genes. Chromosome 10 contains considerable heterochromatin with an enrichment of repetitive elements on 10S and an enrichment of expressed genes on 10L. Multiple insertions from organellar genomes were detected. Collinearity was apparent between rice chromosome 10 and sorghum and maize. Comparison between the draft and finished sequence demonstrates the importance of finished sequence.
3500172	Molecular cloning of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor of rice (oryzacystatin). Homology with animal cystatins and transient expression in the ripening process of rice seeds.	1987	J Biol Chem	A cDNA clone for a cysteine proteinase inhibitor of rice (oryzacystatin) was isolated from a lambda gt10 cDNA library of rice immature seeds by screening with synthesized oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequences of oryzacystatin. A nearly full-length cDNA clone was obtained which encoded 102-amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of oryzacystatin deduced from the cDNA sequence was significantly homologous to those of mammalian cystatins, especially family 2 cystatins. Oryzacystatin contained the sequence Gln-Val-Val-Ala-Gly conserved among most members of the cystatin superfamily. The gene for oryzacystatin was transcribed into a single mRNA species of about 700 nucleotides. The content of mRNA reached its highest level 2 weeks after flowering and then gradually decreased to undetectable levels at 10 weeks. This feature of transient expression is coordinate with that of glutelin (a major storage protein), although the expression of oryzacystatin precedes that of glutelin by about 1 week.
7678765	Gene structure and expression of rice seed allergenic proteins belonging to the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	Genomic and two novel cDNA clones for rice seed allergenic protein (RA) belonging to the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family were isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. Ten cysteine residues deduced from nucleotide sequences were completely conserved among three cDNA clones including a clone, RA17, reported previously. One genomic clone, lambda 4, contained two RA genes, RAG1 and RAG2. Although RAG1 was cloned at the 5' portion only, two RA genes were arranged divergently. Nucleotide sequencing and DNA blotting analyses showed that RA are encoded by a multigene family consisting of at least four members. The transcriptional initiation site of RAG1 was localized at A, 26 bp upstream of the putative translational initiation codon, ATG, by the primer extension assay. The putative TATA box and CAAT box existed about 45 bp and 147 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, respectively. A conserved sequence (ATGCAAAA) which was similar to the sequence (TGCAAAA) identified in rice glutelin promoters was observed in the 5' region of the two genes. In addition, RNA blotting analyses provided that RA genes specifically expressed in ripening seed and their transcripts accumulated maximally between 15 and 20 days after flowering.
11454775	Multiple losses and transfers to the nucleus of two mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase genes during angiosperm evolution.	2001	Genetics	Unlike in animals, the functional transfer of mitochondrial genes to the nucleus is an ongoing process in plants. All but one of the previously reported transfers in angiosperms involve ribosomal protein genes. Here we report frequent transfer of two respiratory genes, sdh3 and sdh4 (encoding subunits 3 and 4 of succinate dehydrogenase), and we also show that these genes are present and expressed in the mitochondria of diverse angiosperms. Southern hybridization surveys reveal that sdh3 and sdh4 have been lost from the mitochondrion about 40 and 19 times, respectively, among the 280 angiosperm genera examined. Transferred, functional copies of sdh3 and sdh4 were characterized from the nucleus in four and three angiosperm families, respectively. The mitochondrial targeting presequences of two sdh3 genes are derived from preexisting genes for anciently transferred mitochondrial proteins. On the basis of the unique presequences of the nuclear genes and the recent mitochondrial gene losses, we infer that each of the seven nuclear sdh3 and sdh4 genes was derived from a separate transfer to the nucleus. These results strengthen the hypothesis that angiosperms are experiencing a recent evolutionary surge of mitochondrial gene transfer to the nucleus and reveal that this surge includes certain respiratory genes in addition to ribosomal protein genes.
10903912	A novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) acidic PR1 gene highly responsive to cut, phytohormones, and protein phosphatase inhibitors.	2000	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A novel rice acidic pathogenesis-related (PR) class 1 cDNA (OsPR1a) was isolated from jasmonic acid (JA)-treated rice seedling leaf. The OsPR1a cDNA is 830 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 507 nucleotides encoding 168 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 17,560 and pI of 4.4. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPR1a has a high level of identity with acidic and basic PR1 proteins from plants. Southern analysis revealed that OsPR1a is a member of a multigene family. The OsPR1a gene was found to be cut-inducible, whereas the phytohormones JA, salicylic acid (SA), 3-indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, and ethylene (using ethylene generator ethephon, ET) enhanced accumulation of OsPR1a transcript, as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitors cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN). Induced expression of OsPR1a gene by JA, CN or EN, and ET was light/dark- and dose-dependent and was almost completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Dark downregulated CN-, EN-, and ET-induced OsPR1a gene expression, whereas it was further enhanced with JA. SA and abscisic acid blocked JA-induced OsPR1a transcript. Simultaneous application of staurosporine (ST) enhances CH- or EN-induced OsPR1a transcript, but not with JA. This is the first report on cloning of a rice acidic PR1 gene (OsPR1a), which is regulated by phytohormones, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event(s), and light.
11244106	Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene.	2001	Plant Physiol	The rice (Oryza sativa) retrotransposon Tos17 is one of a few active retrotransposons in plants and its transposition is activated by tissue culture. Here, we present the characterization of viviparous mutants of rice induced by tissue culture to demonstrate the feasibility of the use of retrotransposon Tos17 as an endogenous insertional mutagen and cloning of the tagged gene for forward genetics in unraveling the gene function. Two mutants were shown to be caused by the insertion of Tos17. Osaba1, a strong viviparous mutant with wilty phenotype, displayed low abscisic acid level and almost no further increase in its levels upon drought. The mutant is shown to be impaired in the epoxidation of zeaxanthin. On the other hand, Ostatc, a mutant with weak phenotype, exhibited the pale green phenotype and slight increase in abscisic acid levels upon drought. Deduced amino acids of the causative genes of Osaba1 and Ostatc manifested a significantly high homology with zeaxanthin epoxidase isolated from other plant species and with bacterial Sec-independent translocase TATC protein, respectively. This is the first example of transposon tagging in rice.
12074577	Isolation of novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) multiple stress responsive MAP kinase gene, OsMSRMK2, whose mRNA accumulates rapidly in response to environmental cues.	2002	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	In search for components of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare), we identified a single copy gene called OsMSRMK2 from jasmonic acid (JA) treated rice seedling leaf cDNA library. This gene has a conserved protein kinase domain, including a MAPK family signature, and encodes a 369 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 42995.43 and a pI of 5.48. OsMSRMK2 did not show constitutive expression in leaves and was induced within 15 min in response to wounding by cut. Using in vitro system, we show that the expression of OsMSRMK2 mRNA was potently enhanced within 15 min by signalling molecules, protein phosphatase inhibitors, ultraviolet irradiation, fungal elicitor, heavy metals, high salt and sucrose, and drought. OsMSRMK2 expression was further modulated by co-application of JA, salicylic acid, and ethylene and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation. Moreover, high (37 degrees C) and low temperatures (12 degrees C) and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide-differentially regulate the OsMSRMK2 mRNA accumulation in leaves of intact plants. Present results demonstrating dramatic transcriptional and transient regulation of the OsMSRMK2 expression by diverse biotic/abiotic stresses, a first report for any rice (or plant) MAPK to date, suggest a role for OsMSRMK2 in rice defense/stress response pathways.
12207666	Characterization of a novel rice gene OsATX and modulation of its expression by components of the stress signalling pathways.	2002	Physiol Plant	In our search to identify gene(s) involved in the rice self-defense responses, we cloned a novel rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) gene, OsATX, a single copy gene, from the JA treated rice seedling leaves cDNA library. This gene encodes a 69 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 7649.7 and a pI of 5.6. OsATX was responsive to cutting (wounding by cutting the excised leaf), over its weak constitutive expression in the healthy leaves. The critical signalling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, together with protein phosphatase inhibitors, effectively up-regulated the OsATX expression with time, over the excised leaf cut control, whereas ethylene had no affect. Furthermore, copper, a heavy metal, also up-regulated OsATX expression. Moreover, induced expression of OsATX mRNA was influenced by light signal(s), and showed a requirement for de novo synthesized protein factors. Additionally, co-application of either JA or ABA with SA drastically suppressed the induced OsATX mRNA level. Finally, the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, triggered OsATX mRNA accumulation. These results strongly suggest a function/role(s) for OsATX in defense/stress responses in rice.
12507518	Novel rice MAP kinases OsMSRMK3 and OsWJUMK1 involved in encountering diverse environmental stresses and developmental regulation.	2003	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	We report isolation of two novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMSRMK3 (multiple stress responsive) and OsWJUMK1 (wound- and JA-uninducible) that most likely exist as single copy genes in its genome. OsMSRMK3 and OsWJUMK1 encode 369 and 569 amino acid polypeptides having the MAPK family signature and phosphorylation activation motifs TEY and TDY, respectively. Steady state mRNA analyses of these MAPKs with constitutive expression in leaves of two-week-old seedlings revealed that OsMSRMK3 was up-regulated upon wounding (by cut), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, abscisic acid, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), protein phosphatase inhibitors, chitosan, high salt/sugar, and heavy metals, whereas OsWJUMK1 not induced by either wounding, JA or SA, showed up-regulation only by H(2)O(2), heavy metals, and cold stress (12 degrees C). Moreover, these MAPKs were developmentally regulated. These results strongly suggest a role for OsMSRMK3 and OsWJUMK1 in both stress-signalling pathways and development in rice.
14559225	Diverse environmental cues transiently regulate OsOPR1 of the "octadecanoid pathway" revealing its importance in rice defense/stress and development.	2003	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Previously, we reported rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica type cv. Nipponbare) allene oxide synthase (OsAOS) and cyclase (OsAOC) genes of the octadecanoid pathway. Here we have isolated a 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase gene, called OsOPR1, encoding the last committed enzymatic step on the octadecanoid pathway leading to jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis. OsOPR1 encodes a 380 amino acid long polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 42465.02 and pI of 5.79, and belongs to a gene family in the rice genome. Transcriptional profiling using our established two-week-old rice seedling model system against a variety of environmental factors such as wounding, global signals (including JA), osmotic stresses, heavy metals, UV-C irradiation, fungal elicitor, protein phosphatase inhibitors, and gaseous pollutants indicated that OsOPR1 transcript was rapidly, transiently and differentially up-regulated within 30 min in leaves. Surprisingly, co-application of signaling molecules JA, salicylate and ethylene, resulted in a massive accumulation of the OsOPR1 transcript at 30 min and remained elevated with time, a new observation. Furthermore, transient expression of OsOPR1, most likely regulated by a de novo synthesized negative trans-acting factor(s), was evidenced by the use of cycloheximide. Finally, the endogenous OsOPR1 expression varied with the stage of plant development. These results strongly suggest a regulatory role for OsOPR1 in rice plant defense/stress response pathway(s) and reproduction.
8341255	Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	We have isolated from rice suspension cells three non-sequence-related cDNAs the expression of which is markedly induced by low, non-freezing temperature. Here we further characterize one of the cDNA clones, lip19. Expression of lip19 is positively regulated by low temperature, but not affected by high (40 degrees C) temperature. Sequencing and primer extension analyses showed that lip19 has a long (552 bp) 5' non-coding sequence followed by a single open reading frame specifying a protein of 148 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein, Lip19, shows at its amino-terminus a conserved basic region followed by a "leucine-zipper" domain. The reported sequence most similar to Lip19 is maize OCSBF-1, which is a bZip-type DNA binding protein. The possibility is suggested that Lip19 is a transcriptional factor that is positively controlled by low temperature.

24377498	Genetic mapping and marker development for resistance of wheat against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Rlnn1 locus, which resides on chromosome 7A of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) confers moderate resistance against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus. Prior to this research, the exact linkage relationships of Rlnn1 with other loci on chromosome 7A were not clear and there were no simple codominant markers available for selection of Rlnn1 in wheat breeding. The objectives of the research reported here were to (1) develop an improved genetic map of the Rlnn1 region of chromosome 7A and (2) develop molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of wheat against P. neglectus.

RESULTS: A large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance against P. neglectus was genetically mapped using a population of Excalibur/Kukri doubled haploid lines. This QTL coincides in position with the rust resistance gene(s) Lr20/Sr15, the phytoene synthase gene Psy-A1 and 10 molecular markers, including five new markers designed using wheat-rice comparative genomics and wheat expressed sequence tags. Two of the new markers are suitable for use as molecular diagnostic tools to distinguish plants that carry Rlnn1 and Lr20/Sr15 from those that do not carry these resistance genes.

CONCLUSIONS: The genomic location of Rlnn1 was confirmed to be in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7A. Molecular markers were developed that provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against P. neglectus in wheat breeding. In Excalibur, genetic recombination seems to be completely suppressed in the Rlnn1 region.
24360894	The retrogradation properties of glutinous rice and buckwheat starches as observed with FT-IR, 13C NMR and DSC.	2014	Int J Biol Macromol	The experiment was conducted to study the retrogradation properties of glutinous rice and buckwheat starch with wavelengths of maximum absorbance, FT-IR, (13)C NMR, and DSC. The results show that the starches in retrograded glutinous rice starch and glutinous rice amylopectin could not form double helix. The IR results show that protein inhabits in glutinous rice and maize starches in a different way and appearance of C-H symmetric stretching vibration at 2852 cm(-1) in starch might be appearance of protein. Retrogradation untied the protein in glutinous amylopectin. Enthalpies of sweet potato and maize granules are higher than those of their retrograded starches. The (13)C NMR results show that retrogradation of those two starches leads to presence of β-anomers and retrogradation might decompose lipids in glutinous rice amylopectin into small molecules. Glutinous rice starch was more inclined to retrogradation than buckwheat starch. The DSC results show that the second peak temperatures for retrograded glutinous rice and buckwheat starches should be assigned to protein. The SEM results show that an obvious layer structure exists in retrograded glutinous rice amylopectin.
24433791	Heavy metals in Australian grown and imported rice and vegetables on sale in Australia: health hazard.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Dietary exposure to heavy metals is a matter of concern for human health risk through the consumption of rice, vegetables and other major foodstuffs. In the present study, we investigated concentrations of cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in Australian grown and imported rice and vegetables on sale in Australia. The mean concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn in Australian grown rice were 7.5 µg kg(-1), 21 µg kg(-1), 144 µg kg(-1), 2.9 mg kg(-1), 24.4 mg kg(-1), 166 µg kg(-1), 375 µg kg(-1), and 17.1 mg kg(-1) dry weight (d. wt.), respectively. Except Cd, heavy metal concentrations in Australian grown rice were higher than Bangladeshi rice on sale in Australia. However, the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, and Ni in Indian rice on sale in Australia were higher than Australian grown rice. The concentrations of Cu and Ni in Vietnamese rice, and that of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb in Thai rice on sale in Australia were also higher than Australian grown rice. Heavy metal concentrations in Pakistani rice on sale in Australia were substantially lower than that in Australian grown rice. In Australian grown rice varieties, the concentrations of heavy metals were considerably higher in brown rice varieties than white rice varieties, indicating Australian brown rice as a potential source of dietary heavy metals for Australian consumers. The mean concentrations of heavy metals in Australian grown and Bangladeshi vegetables on sale in Australia were also determined. Some of the Australian grown and Bangladeshi vegetables contained heavy metals higher than Australian standard maximum limits indicating them as potential sources of dietary heavy metals for Australian consumers. Further investigation is required to estimate health risks of heavy metals from rice and vegetables consumption for Australian consumers.
24372448	Identification of early Al-responsive genes in rice bean (Vigna umbellata) roots provides new clues to molecular mechanisms of Al toxicity and tolerance.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Significant secretion of citrate from root apex of rice bean (Vigna umbellata) is delayed by several hours under aluminium (Al) stress. However, the molecular basis of regulation of VuMATE1, a gene encoding an Al-activated citrate transporter, remains unclear. In this study, we used suppression subtractive hybridization together with reverse northern blot analysis and qRT-PCR to identify genes with altered transcript levels in the root apex after treatment with low (5 μm) or high (25 μm) concentration of AlCl(3) for a short time (4 h). We found that in addition to VuMATE1, 393 genes showed an early response to Al. Among functionally annotated genes, those related to 'metabolism and energy', 'signal transduction and transcription' and 'transport' was predominantly up-regulated, whereas those associated with 'protein translation, processing and degradation' was predominantly down-regulated. Comparative analysis of transcriptional profiles highlighted candidate genes associated with citrate secretion and revealed several new aspects of the molecular processes underlying Al toxicity and tolerance. Based on the data, it is proposed that metabolic changes represent adaptive mechanisms to Al stress, whereas inhibition of both cell elongation and cell division underlies Al-induced root growth inhibition.
24376835	Comparative high-resolution mapping of the wax inhibitors Iw1 and Iw2 in hexaploid wheat.	2013	PLoS One	The wax (glaucousness) on wheat leaves and stems is mainly controlled by two sets of genes: glaucousness loci (W1 and W2) and non-glaucousness loci (Iw1 and Iw2). The non-glaucousness (Iw) loci act as inhibitors of the glaucousness loci (W). High-resolution comparative genetic linkage maps of the wax inhibitors Iw1 originating from Triticum dicoccoides, and Iw2 from Aegilops tauschii were developed by comparative genomics analyses of Brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomic sequences corresponding to the syntenic regions of the Iw loci in wheat. Eleven Iw1 and eight Iw2 linked EST markers were developed and mapped to linkage maps on the distal regions of chromosomes 2BS and 2DS, respectively. The Iw1 locus mapped within a 0.96 cM interval flanked by the BE498358 and CA499581 EST markers that are collinear with 122 kb, 202 kb, and 466 kb genomic regions in the Brachypodium 5S chromosome, the sorghum 6S chromosome and the rice 4S chromosome, respectively. The Iw2 locus was located in a 4.1 to 5.4-cM interval in chromosome 2DS that is flanked by the CJ886319 and CJ519831 EST markers, and this region is collinear with a 2.3 cM region spanning the Iw1 locus on chromosome 2BS. Both Iw1 and Iw2 co-segregated with the BF474014 and CJ876545 EST markers, indicating they are most likely orthologs on 2BS and 2DS. These high-resolution maps can serve as a framework for chromosome landing, physical mapping and map-based cloning of the wax inhibitors in wheat.
24341907	Transcriptome analysis of leaf and root of rice seedling to acute dehydration.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Water deficiency is one of the most serious worldwide problems for agriculture. Recently, it has become more serious and outspread, which urgently requires the production of drought-tolerant plants. Microarray experiments using mRNA from air-dried leaves and roots of rice were performed in an attempt to study genes involved in acute dehydration response.

RESULTS: Set of 10,537 rice genes was significantly up- or down-regulated in leaves or roots under the treatment. Gene Ontology analysis highlighted gene expression during acute dehydration response depending on organ types and the duration of stress. Rice responded by down-regulating many processes which are mainly involved in inhibiting growth and development. On the other hand, phytohormones (ABA, cytokinin, brassinosteroid) and protective molecules were induced to answer to multiple stresses. Leaves induced more genes than roots but those genes were scattered in various processes, most significantly were productions of osmoprotectants and precursors for important pathways in roots. Roots up-regulated fewer genes and focused on inducing antioxidants and enhancing photosynthesis. Myb, zf-C3HC4, and NAM were most strongly affected transcription factors with the dominance of leaf over root.

CONCLUSIONS: Leaf and root tissues shared some common gene expression during stress, with the purpose of enhancing protective systems. However, these two tissues appeared to act differently in response to the different level of dehydration they experience. Besides, they can affect each other via the signaling and transportation system.
24385353	The proportion of non-aflatoxigenic strains of the Aspergillus flavus/oryzae complex from meju by analyses of the aflatoxin biosynthetic genes.	2013	J Microbiol	Strains of the Aspergillus flavus/oryzae complex are frequently isolated from meju, a fermented soybean product, that is used as the starting material for ganjang (soy sauce) and doenjang (soybean paste) production. In this study, we examined the aflatoxin producing capacity of A. flavus/oryzae strains isolated from meju. 192 strains of A. flavus/oryzae were isolated from more than 100 meju samples collected from diverse regions of Korea from 2008 to 2011, and the norB-cypA, omtA, and aflR genes in the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster were analyzed. We found that 178 strains (92.7%) belonged to non-aflatoxigenic group (Type I of norB-cypA, IB-L-B-, IC-AO, or IA-L-B- of omtA, and AO type of aflR), and 14 strains (7.3%) belonged to aflatoxin-producible group (Type II of norB-cypA, IC-L-B+/B- or IC-L-B+ of omtA, and AF type of aflR). Only 7 strains (3.6%) in the aflatoxin-producible group produced aflatoxins on Czapek yeast-extract medium. The aflatoxin-producing capability of A. flavus/oryzae strains from other sources in Korea were also investigated, and 92.9% (52/56) strains from air, 93.9% (31/33) strains from rice straw, 91.7% (11/12) strains from soybean, 81.3% (13/16) strains from corn, 82% (41/50) strains from peanut, and 73.2% (41/56) strains from arable soil were included in the non-aflatoxigenic group. The proportion of non-aflatoxigenicity of meju strains was similar to that of strains from soybean, air and rice straw, all of which have an effect on the fermentation of meju. The data suggest that meju does not have a preference for non-aflatoxigenic or aflatoxin-producible strains of A. flavus/oryzae from the environment of meju. The non-aflatoxigenic meju strains are proposed to be named A. oryzae, while the meju strains that can produce aflatoxins should be referred to A. flavus in this study.
24302714	Accumulation of mercury in rice grain and cabbage grown on representative Chinese soils.	2013	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	A pot culture experiment was carried out to investigate the accumulation properties of mercury (Hg) in rice grain and cabbage grown in seven soil types (Udic Ferrisols, Mollisol, Periudic Argosols, Latosol, Ustic Cambosols, Calcaric Regosols, and Stagnic Anthrosols) spiked with different concentrations of Hg (CK, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 mg/kg). The results of this study showed that Hg accumulation of plants was significantly affected by soil types. Hg concentration in both rice grain and cabbage increased with soil Hg concentrations, but this increase differed among the seven soils. The stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that pH, Mn(II), particle size distribution, and cation exchange capacity have a close relationship with Hg accumulation in plants, which suggested that physicochemical characteristics of soils can affect the Hg accumulation in rice grain and cabbage. Critical Hg concentrations in seven soils were identified for rice grain and cabbage based on the maximum safe level for daily intake of Hg, dietary habits of the population, and Hg accumulation in plants grown in different soil types. Soil Hg limits for rice grain in Udic Ferrisols, Mollisol, Periudic Argosols, Latosol, Ustic Cambosols, Calcaric Regosols, and Stagnic Anthrosols were 1.10, 2.00, 2.60, 2.78, 1.53, 0.63, and 2.17 mg/kg, respectively, and critical soil Hg levels for cabbage are 0.27, 1.35, 1.80, 1.70, 0.69, 1.68, and 2.60 mg/kg, respectively.
24370926	Improved production of reducing sugars from rice husk and rice straw using bacterial cellulase and xylanase activated with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.	2014	Bioresour Technol	Purified bacterial cellulase and xylanase were activated in the presence of calcium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (NP) with concomitant increase in thermostability about 35% increment in production of d-xylose and reducing sugars from rice husk and rice straw was obtained at 80°C by the sequential treatment of xylanase and cellulase enzymes in the presence of NP compared to the untreated enzyme sets. Our findings suggested that if the rice husk and the rice straw samples were pre-treated with xylanase prior to treatment with cellulase, the percentage increase of reducing sugar per 100g of substrate (starting material) was enhanced by about 29% and 41%, respectively. These findings can be utilized for the extraction of reducing sugars from cellulose and xylan containing waste material. The purely enzymatic extraction procedure can be substituted for the harsh and bio-adverse chemical methods.
24338426	Genetic relationships of Pacific abalone (Haliotidae) species determined using universal rice primer-polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with universal rice primers (URP) was used to identify species and to determine phylogenetic relationships for the 6 economically important Korean Pacific abalone species: Haliotis discus hannai, H. discus discus, H. madaka, H. gigantea, H. diversicolor supertexta, and H. diversicolor diversicolor, whose morphological differentiation is difficult. Of the 12 URPs used in this study, 7 were effective in producing reproducible RAPD markers for these 6 species. Amplifications with the 7 URP primers yielded 129 reproducible amplified fragments ranging between 100 and 6000 bp in length. The dendrogram generated by the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages showed that the 6 species were divided into 4 groups at 0.44 similarity level, indicating that they were genetically distant from each other and had little internal phylogenetic resolution. One group included H. discus hannai, H. discus discus, H. madaka, and H. gigantea, which were divided into 2 groups at 0.52 similarity level: one group of H. discus hannai, H. discus discus, and H. madaka, and the other of H. gigantea. H. diversicolor supertexta and H. diversicolor diversicolor belonged to the other group. Furthermore, the reproducible pattern of amplified DNA bands by URP primers indicated the possibility of using these as molecular markers for the discrimination of the 6 Pacific abalone species. These results suggest that the URP-PCR approach will be a useful tool for obtaining accurate taxonomic identification and genetic relationship of Korean Pacific abalones, which is one of the first prerequisites in effective conservation programs.
24317430	Pro-apoptotic effect of rice bran inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) on HT-29 colorectal cancer cells.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), or phytic acid is a natural dietary ingredient and has been described as a "natural cancer fighter", being an essential component of nutritional diets. The marked anti-cancer effect of IP6 has resulted in our quest for an understanding of its mechanism of action. In particular, our data provided strong evidence for the induction of apoptotic cell death, which may be attributable to the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xl in favor of apoptosis. In addition, the up-regulation of caspase-3 and -8 expression and activation of both caspases may also contribute to the apoptotic cell death of human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells when exposed to IP6. Collectively, this present study has shown that rice bran IP6 induces apoptosis, by regulating the pro- and anti-apoptotic markers; Bax and Bcl-xl and via the activation of caspase molecules (caspase-3 and -8).
24366178	Set up of an automatic water quality sampling system in irrigation agriculture.	2013	Sensors (Basel)	We have developed a high-resolution automatic sampling system for continuous in situ measurements of stable water isotopic composition and nitrogen solutes along with hydrological information. The system facilitates concurrent monitoring of a large number of water and nutrient fluxes (ground, surface, irrigation and rain water) in irrigated agriculture. For this purpose we couple an automatic sampling system with a Wavelength-Scanned Cavity Ring Down Spectrometry System (WS-CRDS) for stable water isotope analysis (δ2H and δ18O), a reagentless hyperspectral UV photometer (ProPS) for monitoring nitrate content and various water level sensors for hydrometric information. The automatic sampling system consists of different sampling stations equipped with pumps, a switch cabinet for valve and pump control and a computer operating the system. The complete system is operated via internet-based control software, allowing supervision from nearly anywhere. The system is currently set up at the International Rice Research Institute (Los Baños, The Philippines) in a diversified rice growing system to continuously monitor water and nutrient fluxes. Here we present the system's technical set-up and provide initial proof-of-concept with results for the isotopic composition of different water sources and nitrate values from the 2012 dry season.
24377869	QTL scanning for rice yield using a whole genome SNP array.	2013	J Genet Genomics	High-throughput SNP genotyping is widely used for plant genetic studies. Recently, a RICE6K SNP array has been developed based on the Illumina Bead Array platform and Infinium SNP assay technology for genome-wide evaluation of allelic variations and breeding applications. In this study, the RICE6K SNP array was used to genotype a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between the indica variety, Zhenshan 97, and the japonica variety, Xizang 2. A total of 3324 SNP markers of high quality were identified and were grouped into 1495 recombination bins in the RIL population. A high-density linkage map, consisting of the 1495 bins, was developed, covering 1591.2 cM and with average length of 1.1 cM per bin. Segregation distortions were observed in 24 regions of the 11 chromosomes in the RILs. One half of the distorted regions contained fertility genes that had been previously reported. A total of 23 QTLs were identified for yield. Seven QTLs were firstly detected in this study. The positive alleles from about half of the identified QTLs came from Zhenshan 97 and they had lower phenotypic values than Xizang 2. This indicated that favorable alleles for breeding were dispersed in both parents and pyramiding favorable alleles could develop elite lines. The size of the mapping population for QTL analysis using high throughput SNP genotyping platform is also discussed.
24370676	Swarming behaviour in natural populations of Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii: review of 4 years survey in rural areas of sympatry, Burkina Faso (West Africa).	2014	Acta Trop	The swarming behaviour of natural populations of Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii (formerly known as An. gambiae S and M forms, respectively) were investigated through longitudinal surveys conducted between July 2006 and October 2009 in two rural areas of south-western Burkina Faso where these forms are sympatric. In both sites, the majority of swarms were recorded above visual markers localised among houses. In Soumousso, a wooded area of savannah, 108 pairs caught in copula from 205 swarms were sampled; in VK7, a rice growing area, 491 couples from 250 swarms were sampled. If segregated swarms were the norm in both sites, many visual markers were shared by the two forms of An. gambiae. Furthermore, mixed swarms were collected annually in frequencies varying from one site to another, though no mixed inseminations were recorded, corroborating the low hybrid rate previously reported in the field. The occurrence of inter-specific mate-recognition mechanisms, which allow individuals to avoid hybridisation, is discussed.
24611390	[Change of LAI and spectral response for rice under flood and waterlogging stress].	2013	Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi	In order to provide the foundational theoretical support for flood loss estimation of rice with RS, the change of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy spectral response during four developmental stages and three waterlogging depths were studied, and the LAI estimation model was established with spectra characteristics parameter using regression analysis method. The results show that LAI value decreases as water depth increases in tillering, jointing and heading stages, and LAI value under complete submergence decreased by 36. 36% than CK in jointing stages. "Double-Peak" presented in the canopy first derivative spectra of 680-760 nm where the red edge parameters existed, and the main peak is located in the 724-737 nm with 701 and 718 nm exhibiting secondary peak. With water depth increasing, "Triple-Peak" emerges especially. The red edge position moves to long-wavelength direction in each developmental stage. Blue shift of red edge amplitude and red edge area was detected in tillering, jointing and filling stages, while red shift appeared in heading stage. The relationship between spectra characteristics parameters and LAI were investigated during 4 growth stages, results were not consistently significant at any wavelengths, and the leaf area indices were significantly correlative to the spectra parameters before heading stage, so the spectra parameters before heading stage can be used to estimate the leaf area indices, and a regression model based on parameter D(lambda737)/D(lambda718) was recommended. Therefore the variation range of LAI for rice could response to the stress intensity directly, and the regression model LAI= 3. 138(D(lambda737)/D(lambda718))-0. 806 can precisely estimate the leaf area index under flooding and waterlogging stress.

24371165	Mapping quantitative trait loci associated with yield and yield components under reproductive stage salinity stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Genet	Salinity tolerance in rice is critical at reproductive stage because it ultimately determines grain yield. An F2 mapping population derived from a Sadri/FL478 cross was exposed to saline field conditions (6-8 dS m(-1)) after the active tillering stage to identify reproductive stage specific QTLs for salinity tolerance. Genetic linkage map was constructed using 123 microsatellite markers on 232 F2 progenies. Totally 35 QTLs for 11 traits under salinity stress were detected with LOD > 3, out of which 28 QTLs that explained from 5.9 to 30.0% phenotypic variation were found to be significant based on permutation test. Three major QTL clusters were found on chromosomes 2 (RM423-RM174), 4 (RM551-RM518) and 6 (RM20224-RM528) for multiple traits under salinity stress. Both parental lines contributed additively for QTLs identified for the yield components. A majority of the QTLs detected in our study are reported for the first time for reproductive stage salinity stress. Fine-mapping of selected putative QTLs will be the next step to facilitate marker-assisted backcrossing and to detect useful genes for salinity tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice.
24228908	Rumen microbes and microbial protein synthesis in Thai native beef cattle fed with feed blocks supplemented with a urea-calcium sulphate mixture.	2013	Arch Anim Nutr	The influence of slow-release urea ( urea-calcium sulphate mixture; U-CaS) in feed blocks on rumen micro-organisms, predominant cellulolytic bacteria, microbial protein synthesis and ecology was studied in Thai native beef cattle. Four animals with an initial body weight of 100 ± 3.0 kg were randomly assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments (U-CaS in iso-nitrogen feed blocks at 0, 120, 150 and 180 g/kg dry matter (DM), respectively; U-CaS replaced urea). After 21 days of experimental feeding, rumen fluid was collected at 0 and 4 h after feeding. The mean intake of feed blocks and other feedstuffs offered (rice straw and concentrates) amounted to 0.3, 2.3 and 0.6 kg DM/day, respectively. Inclusion of U-CaS did not altered pH and temperature in the rumen. However, ruminal NH3-N concentration decreased quadratically (p < 0.05) in response to U-CaS inclusion, with the lowest value at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. With inclusion of U-CaS, the populations of rumen bacteria increased quadratically (p < 0.05) and counts of fungal zoospores were linearly enhanced (p < 0.05), being highest at 180 g U-CaS per kg feed block. Supplementation of U-CaS increased the concentration of total bacteria linearly (p < 0.05) and of Fibrobacter succinogenes quadratically (p < 0.05), whereas Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were not affected by dietary treatments. Microbial crude protein yield and efficiency of microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis were linearly increased with different levels of U-CaS addition. Furthermore, current data clearly indicate that inclusion of U-CaS in feed blocks can affect micro-organism diversity and major cellulolytic bacteria.
24376554	Nitric oxide in plants: the roles of ascorbate and hemoglobin.	2013	PLoS One	Ascorbic acid and hemoglobins have been linked to nitric oxide metabolism in plants. It has been hypothesized that ascorbic acid directly reduces plant hemoglobin in support of NO scavenging, producing nitrate and monodehydroascorbate. In this scenario, monodehydroascorbate reductase uses NADH to reduce monodehydroascorbate back to ascorbate to sustain the cycle. To test this hypothesis, rates of rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin reduction by ascorbate were measured directly, in the presence and absence of purified rice monodehydroascorbate reductase and NADH. Solution NO scavenging was also measured methodically in the presence and absence of rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin and monodehydroascorbate reductase, under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, in an effort to gauge the likelihood of these proteins affecting NO metabolism in plant tissues. Our results indicate that ascorbic acid slowly reduces rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin at a rate identical to myoglobin reduction. The product of the reaction is monodehydroascorbate, which can be efficiently reduced back to ascorbate in the presence of monodehydroascorbate reductase and NADH. However, our NO scavenging results suggest that the direct reduction of plant hemoglobin by ascorbic acid is unlikely to serve as a significant factor in NO metabolism, even in the presence of monodehydroascorbate reductase. Finally, the possibility that the direct reaction of nitrite/nitrous acid and ascorbic acid produces NO was measured at various pH values mimicking hypoxic plant cells. Our results suggest that this reaction is a likely source of NO as the plant cell pH drops below 7, and as nitrite concentrations rise to mM levels during hypoxia.
24317058	Improved palatability and bio-functionality of super-hard rice by soaking in a barley-koji miso suspension.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Cooked grains of ae rice cultivars are too hard and non-sticky due to the presence of long-chain amylopectin, and ae rice cultivars are therefore called ``super-hard rice'' and cannot be used as table rice. However, they are promising in terms of their bio-functionality such as preventing diabetes. Miso (soybean paste) is a yeast-fermented food, made from steamed soybeans, salt, and inoculated cereals known as koji, made from rice, barley, or soybeans.We investigated the effects of soaking ae mutant rice cultivars in a miso suspension. Their chemical components, physical properties, and enzyme activities were measured under different conditions (milled rice before or after soaking in a 5% barley-koji miso suspension). Rice grains cooked after soaking in the miso suspension were less hard and more sticky than those cooked after soaking in water. Rice grains cooked after soaking in a 5% barley-koji miso suspension maintained high amounts of resistant starch and dietary fiber, and were fortified with polyphenols and isoflavones. Palatable and bio-functional ae rice could therefore be produced by cooking after soaking in a 5% barley-koji miso suspension.
24467893	Genistein production in rice seed via transformation with soybean IFS genes.	2014	Plant Sci	To produce genistein in rice, the isoflavone synthase (IFS) genes, SpdIFS1 and SpdIFS2 were cloned from the Korean soybean cultivar, Sinpaldalkong II as it has a higher genistein content than other soybean varieties. SpdIFS1 and SpdIFS2 show a 99.6% and 98.2% identity at the nucleotide level and 99.4% and 97.9% identity at the amino acid level, respectively, with IFS1 and IFS2 from soybean (GenBank accession Nos. AF195798 and AF195819). Plant expression vectors were constructed harboring SpdIFS1 or SpdIFS2 under the control of a rice globulin promoter that directs seed specific expression, and used to transform two rice varieties, Heugnam, a black rice, and Nakdong, a normal rice cultivar without anthocyanin pigment. Because naringenin, the substrate of SpdIFS1 and SpdIFS2, is on the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, the relative production rate of genistein was compared between SpdIFS-expressing transgenic Heugnam and Nakdong. Southern blot analysis of eight of the resulting transgenic rice plants revealed that the T0 plants had one to three copies of the SpdIFS1 or SpdIFS2 gene. The highest level of genistein content found in rice seeds was 103 μg/g. These levels were about 30-fold higher in our transgenic rice lines than the genistein aglycon content of a non-leguminous IFS-expressing transgenic tobacco petal, equaling about 12% of total genistein content of Sinpaldalkong II. There were no significant differences found between the genistein content in Heugnam and Nakdong transgenic rice plants.
24338598	Aspects of health in prehistoric mainland Southeast Asia: Indicators of stress in response to the intensification of rice agriculture.	2014	Am J Phys Anthropol	Numerous bioarcheological investigations have suggested that as agriculture intensifies, levels of physiological stress and poor health increase. However, previous research in Southeast Asia suggests that a decline in health was not universal. This study aimed to provide the first investigation of human health during the intensification of rice agriculture in the large skeletal sample from the prehistoric site of Ban Non Wat, Northeast Thailand (1750-420 b.c.). Health was analysed using two indicators of childhood stress, the prevalence of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), a measure of early childhood stress, and stature, as a measure of late childhood stress, were collated for 190 adults. Sex-specific diachronic relationships between the prevalence of LEH and stature were explored. For both sexes, initially the prevalence of LEH was found to decrease and then increase over time. Stature remained constant over time for males, although for females stature increased initially, then decreased. Early childhood stress was not significantly correlated with stature in females (P = 0.185), but high levels of LEH were unexpectedly correlated with taller male stature (P = 0.017). Our findings suggest an initial improvement in health during agricultural intensification at this site, likely related to a reduction in physiological perturbations and maintenance of a nutritious diet during this time. The subsequent deterioration in health may reflect geomorphologically and archaeologically indicated variation in environmental conditions and consequential sociocultural changes. We suggest that the sex-differences in the relationship between stature and LEH may relate to the timing of stress and/or catch-up growth.
24324764	Leaf morphology and ultrastructure responses to elevated O3 in transgenic Bt (cry1Ab/cry1Ac) rice and conventional rice under fully open-air field conditions.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Elevated tropospheric ozone severely affects not only yield but also the morphology, structure and physiological functions of plants. Because of concerns regarding the potential environmental risk of transgenic crops, it is important to monitor changes in transgenic insect-resistant rice under the projected high tropospheric ozone before its commercial release.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) system, we investigated the changes in leaf morphology and leaf ultrastructure of two rice varieties grown in plastic pots, transgenic Bt Shanyou 63 (Bt-SY63, carrying a fusion gene of cry1Ab and cry1Ac) and its non-transgenic counterpart (SY63), in elevated O3 (E-O3) versus ambient O3 (A-O3) after 64-DAS (Days after seeding), 85-DAS and 102-DAS. Our results indicated that E-O3 had no significant effects on leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, stomatal length and stomatal density for both Bt-SY63 and SY63. E-O3 increased the leaf thickness of Bt-SY63, but decreased that of SY63. O3 stress caused early swelling of the thylakoids of chloroplasts, a significant increase in the proportion of total plastoglobule area in the entire cell area (PCAP) and a significant decrease in the proportion of total starch grain area in the entire cell area (SCAP), suggesting that E-O3 accelerated the leaf senescence of the two rice genotypes. Compared with SY63, E-O3 caused early swelling of the thylakoids of chloroplasts and more substantial breakdown of chloroplasts in Bt-SY63.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the incorporation of cry1Ab/Ac into SY63 could induce unintentional changes in some parts of plant morphology and that O3 stress results in greater leaf damage to Bt-SY63 than to SY63, with the former coupled with higher O3 sensitivity in CCAP (the proportions of total chloroplast area in the entire cell area), PCAP and SCAP. This study provides valuable baseline information for the prospective commercial release of transgenic crops under the projected future climate.
24306352	Different non-host resistance responses of two rice subspecies, japonica and indica, to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Japonica and indica have different non-host resistance (NHR) abilities to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has a positive function in NHR to japonica against Pst.

ABSTRACT: Non-host interactions between Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and two rice subspecies were characterized using 23 rice varieties, including 11 japonica and 12 indica. Results showed that the infected fungal structures were easily produced in the leaves of indica, whereas only several substomatal vesicles and primary infection hyphae were observed in the leaves of japonica. This result indicated that indica is less resistant or more susceptible to Pst than japonica. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the initial phase of japonica-Pst interaction but not in indica-Pst interaction. A set of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes was also induced in response to Pst infection, suggesting that ROS activation is one of the major mechanisms of non-host resistance of rice to Pst.
24365393	POMO--Plotting Omics analysis results for Multiple Organisms.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Systems biology experiments studying different topics and organisms produce thousands of data values across different types of genomic data. Further, data mining analyses are yielding ranked and heterogeneous results and association networks distributed over the entire genome. The visualization of these results is often difficult and standalone web tools allowing for custom inputs and dynamic filtering are limited.

RESULTS: We have developed POMO (http://pomo.cs.tut.fi), an interactive web-based application to visually explore omics data analysis results and associations in circular, network and grid views. The circular graph represents the chromosome lengths as perimeter segments, as a reference outer ring, such as cytoband for human. The inner arcs between nodes represent the uploaded network. Further, multiple annotation rings, for example depiction of gene copy number changes, can be uploaded as text files and represented as bar, histogram or heatmap rings. POMO has built-in references for human, mouse, nematode, fly, yeast, zebrafish, rice, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Escherichia coli. In addition, POMO provides custom options that allow integrated plotting of unsupported strains or closely related species associations, such as human and mouse orthologs or two yeast wild types, studied together within a single analysis. The web application also supports interactive label and weight filtering. Every iterative filtered result in POMO can be exported as image file and text file for sharing or direct future input.

CONCLUSIONS: The POMO web application is a unique tool for omics data analysis, which can be used to visualize and filter the genome-wide networks in the context of chromosomal locations as well as multiple network layouts. With the several illustration and filtering options the tool supports the analysis and visualization of any heterogeneous omics data analysis association results for many organisms. POMO is freely available and does not require any installation or registration.
24378555	A genome-wide analysis of the expansin genes in Malus × Domestica.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Expansins were first identified as cell wall-loosening proteins; they are involved in regulating cell expansion, fruits softening and many other physiological processes. However, our knowledge about the expansin family members and their evolutionary relationships in fruit trees, such as apple, is limited. In this study, we identified 41 members of the expansin gene family in the genome of apple (Malus × Domestica L. Borkh). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that expansin genes in apple could be divided into four subfamilies according to their gene structures and protein motifs. By phylogenetic analysis of the expansins in five plants (Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, grape and apple), the expansins were divided into 17 subgroups. Our gene duplication analysis revealed that whole-genome and chromosomal-segment duplications contributed to the expansion of Mdexpansins. The microarray and expressed sequence tag (EST) data showed that 34 Mdexpansin genes could be divided into five groups by the EST analysis; they may also play different roles during fruit development. An expression model for MdEXPA16 and MdEXPA20 showed their potential role in developing fruit. Overall, our study provides useful data and novel insights into the functions and regulatory mechanisms of the expansin genes in apple, as well as their evolution and divergence. As the first step towards genome-wide analysis of the expansin genes in apple, our results have established a solid foundation for future studies on the function of the expansin genes in fruit development.
24335666	Rubus idaeus L Inhibits Invasion Potential of Human A549 Lung Cancer Cells by Suppression Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Akt Pathway In Vitro and Reduces Tumor Growth In Vivo.	2014	Integr Cancer Ther	The metastasis of lung cancer is the most prevalent cause of patient death. Various treatment strategies have targeted the prevention of the occurrence of metastasis. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells is considered a prerequisite to acquire the invasive/migratory phenotype and to subsequently achieve metastasis. However, the effects ofRubus idaeuson cancer invasion and the EMT of the human lung carcinoma remain unclear. In this article, we test the hypothesis thatR idaeusethyl acetate (RIAE) possesses an antimetastatic effect and reverses the EMT potential of human lung A549 cells. We extract the raspberryR idaeuswith methanol (RIME), chloroform (RICE), ethyl acetate (RIAE),n-butanol (RIBE), and water (RIWE). The RIAE treatment obviously inhibits the invasive (P< .001), motility (P< .001), spreading, and migratory potential (P< .001) of highly metastatic human lung cancer A549 cells. The zymography and promoter luciferase analysis reveals that RIAE decreases the proteinase and transcription activities of MMP-2 and u-PA. Molecular analyses show that RIAE increases the E-cadherin level that is mainly localized at the cellular membrane. This result was also verified through confocal analyses. RIAE also induces the upregulation of an epithelial marker, such as α-catenin, and decreases mesenchymal markers, such as snail-1 and N-cadherin, that promote cell invasion and metastasis. RIAE inhibits MMP-2 and u-PA by attenuating the NF-κB and p-Akt expression. The inhibition of RIAE on the growth of A549 cells in vivo was also verified using a cancer cell xenograft nude mice model. Our results show the anti-invasive/antitumor effects of RIAE and associated mechanisms, which suggest that RIAE should be further tested in clinically relevant models to exploit its potential benefits against metastatic lung cancer cells.
24484953	GIP1 may act as a coactivator that enhances transcriptional activity of LBD18 in Arabidopsis.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (LBD/ASL) gene family encodes a class of transcription factors harboring a conserved plant-specific lateral organ boundaries domain and plays a key role in lateral organ development of plants. Recent studies have revealed developmental functions of some LBD genes in Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. We have shown previously that LBD18/ASL20 promotes the emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis. LBD18 induces EXPANSIN14 (EXP14) expression by binding to a specific region of the EXP14 promoter. To further understand the molecular mechanism of LBD18 acting as a transcription factor, we isolated a protein interacting with LBD18 by screening an Arabidopsis cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system with LBD18 as bait. We found that GBF INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (GIP1) interacts with LBD18 in yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed overlapping expression of GIP1 and LBD18 in various tissues of Arabidopsis such as roots, aerial parts, and rosette leaves. Transient gene expression assay results with Arabidopsis protoplasts indicated that GIP1 enhances transcriptional activity of LBD18 in the EXP14 promoter fused to the GUS reporter gene. These results show that GIP1 may act as a transcriptional coactivator of LBD18.
24322445	Characterization of a maize Wip1 promoter in transgenic plants.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	The Maize Wip1 gene encodes a wound-induced Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) protein which is a type of serine protease inhibitor, and its expression is induced by wounding or infection, conferring resistance against pathogens and pests. In this study, the maize Wip1 promoter was isolated and its function was analyzed. Different truncated Wip1 promoters were fused upstream of the GUS reporter gene and transformed into Arabidopsis, tobacco and rice plants. We found that (1) several truncated maize Wip1 promoters led to strong GUS activities in both transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco leaves, whereas low GUS activity was detected in transgenic rice leaves; (2) the Wip1 promoter was not wound-induced in transgenic tobacco leaves, but was induced by wounding in transgenic rice leaves; (3) the truncated Wip1 promoter had different activity in different organs of transgenic tobacco plants; (4) the transgenic plant leaves containing different truncated Wip1 promoters had low GUS transcripts, even though high GUS protein level and GUS activities were observed; (5) there was one transcription start site of Wip1 gene in maize and two transcription start sites of GUS in Wip1::GUS transgenic lines; (6) the adjacent 35S promoter which is present in the transformation vectors enhanced the activity of the truncated Wip1 promoters in transgenic tobacco leaves, but did not influence the disability of truncated Wip1231 promoter to respond to wounding signals. We speculate that an ACAAAA hexamer, several CAA trimers and several elements similar to ACAATTAC octamer in the 5'-untranslated region might contribute to the strong GUS activity in Wip1231 transgenic lines, meanwhile, compared to the 5'-untranslated region from Wip1231 transgenic lines, the additional upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5'-untranslated region from Wip1737 transgenic lines might contribute to the lower level of GUS transcript and GUS activity.
24355316	Two stage treatment of dairy effluent using immobilized Chlorella pyrenoidosa.	2013	J Environ Health Sci Eng	BACKGROUND: Dairy effluents contains high organic load and unscrupulous discharge of these effluents into aquatic bodies is a matter of serious concern besides deteriorating their water quality. Whilst physico-chemical treatment is the common mode of treatment, immobilized microalgae can be potentially employed to treat high organic content which offer numerous benefits along with waste water treatment.

METHODS: A novel low cost two stage treatment was employed for the complete treatment of dairy effluent. The first stage consists of treating the diary effluent in a photobioreactor (1 L) using immobilized Chlorella pyrenoidosa while the second stage involves a two column sand bed filtration technique.

RESULTS: Whilst NH4+-N was completely removed, a 98% removal of PO43--P was achieved within 96 h of two stage purification processes. The filtrate was tested for toxicity and no mortality was observed in the zebra fish which was used as a model at the end of 96 h bioassay. Moreover, a significant decrease in biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand was achieved by this novel method. Also the biomass separated was tested as a biofertilizer to the rice seeds and a 30% increase in terms of length of root and shoot was observed after the addition of biomass to the rice plants.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the two stage treatment of dairy effluent is highly effective in removal of BOD and COD besides nutrients like nitrates and phosphates. The treatment also helps in discharging treated waste water safely into the receiving water bodies since it is non toxic for aquatic life. Further, the algal biomass separated after first stage of treatment was highly capable of increasing the growth of rice plants because of nitrogen fixation ability of the green alga and offers a great potential as a biofertilizer.
24313332	Melatonin synthesis in rice seedlings in vivo is enhanced at high temperatures and under dark conditions due to increased serotonin N-acetyltransferase and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase activities.	2014	J Pineal Res	Temperature and light are important environmental factors for plant growth and development. The final two enzymes in the melatonin synthesis pathway in plants are serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT), which have thermophilic characteristics. Thus, the effects of temperature and light on melatonin synthesis in rice seedlings were investigated. Here, we demonstrated that melatonin levels increased as temperature increased when rice seedlings were exposed to various temperatures for 1 hr. Moreover, the relative melatonin levels were higher in the dark. For example, exposure of rice seedlings to 1-hr darkness at 55°C resulted in a melatonin yield of 4.9 ng/g fresh weight (fw), compared with 2.95 ng/g fw under light conditions. Temperature-dependent melatonin synthesis was closely associated with an increase in both SNAT and ASMT activities, but not with transcript levels of melatonin biosynthetic genes. The daily melatonin levels in field-grown rice plants were unaffected as the positive effect of the relatively high temperature during the day was counteracted by the negative effect of the high light. The opposite effect occurred during the night, in which the positive effect of darkness on melatonin synthesis was counteracted by the negative effect of a low temperature.
24388655	Molecular analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis lux-like mel2 operon.	2013	Tuberculosis (Edinb)	Using a high throughput genetic strategy, designated Random Inducible Controlled Expression (RICE), we identified the six gene mel2 locus in Mtb and M. marinum. Interestingly, three of the genes present in mel2 have similarities to bioluminescence genes. Similar to other bacterial bioluminescence systems, mel2 facilitates detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Through the use of thin layer chromatography (TLC) we demonstrate enhanced production of the cell wall virulence lipid, pthiocerol dimycoserosate (PDIM), in a Mtb mel2 mutant relative to the wild type strain in the presence of both H2O2 and diamide oxidative stresses. Furthermore, propionate toxicity assays revealed increased accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the mel2 mutant relative to wild type. These observations provide the first evidence that mel2 plays a critical role in Mtb lipid biosynthesis.
24391003	Genome-wide identification, characterization, and expression analysis of the MLO gene family in Cucumis sativus.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Mildew resistance locus o (MLO) is a plant-specific seven-transmembrane (TM) gene family. Several studies have revealed that certain members of the MLO gene family mediate powdery mildew susceptibility in three plant species, namely, Arabidopsis, barley, and tomato. The sequenced cucumber genome provides an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive overview of the MLO gene family. Fourteen genes (designated CsMLO01 through CsMLO14) have been identified within the Cucumis sativus genome by using an in silico cloning method with the MLO amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice as probes. Sequence alignment revealed that numerous features of the gene family, such as TMs, a calmodulin-binding domain, peptide domains I and II, and 30 important amino acid residues for MLO function, are well conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of the MLO genes from cucumber and other plant species reveals seven different clades (I through VII). Three of these clades comprised MLO genes from A. thaliana, rice, maize, and cucumber, suggesting that these genes may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. In silico mapping showed that these CsMLOs were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 without any obvious clustering, except CsMLO01. To our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive report on MLO genes in C. sativus. These findings will facilitate the functional characterization of the MLOs related to powdery mildew susceptibility and assist in the development of disease resistance in cucumber.
24669714	[Determination of 34 pesticide residues in rice, proso millet and wheat with QuEChERS-on line gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry].	2013	Se Pu	A method for the simultaneous determination of 34 pesticides in rice, proso millet and wheat by QuEChERS coupled with on line gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GPC-GC-MS) was developed. The effects of the sample weight, extraction solvent, sorbent for purification were investigated. The matrix effect and the usefulness of analyte protectant were also studied. The identification and quantification were performed by GPC-GC-MS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and exrternal standard method. The calibration curves of the 34 pesticides showed good linearity in th range of 0.0125-0.2 mg/L with thea correlations coefficients (r2) between 0.968 and 0.999. The average recoveries were 94.5%-117.1%, 83.1%-121.7% and 93.1%-120.2% with the relative standard deviations (RSDs, n = 6) no more than 14.5%, 15.1% and 15.2% in rice, proso millet and wheat samples, respectively. The LODs of this method were 0.0281-5.31, 0.0282-4.82 and 0.0273 -5.13 microg/kg (S/N = 3) for rice, proso millet and wheat samples, respectively. The low cost and less consumption of reagents of this method are in accordance with the concept of green chemistry. The convenient operation and versatility of this method are suitable for the fast screening and detection of the 34 pesticide residues in rice, proso millet and wheat.
24317047	Transient dual-luciferase assay combined with a glucocorticoid-inducible system for rice protoplasts.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We describe a transient dual-luciferase assay combined with a glucocorticoid-inducible system for rice protoplasts. Luciferase genes were efficiently induced by adding 0.1 µM of dexamethasone to the protoplast suspension, the activity of the luciferases reaching a maximum 6 h after induction. This assay system is applicable to studying the translation efficiency of rice by using the luciferase gene harboring tandem copies of an interesting codon at the 5' end.
24402821	Studies on interaction of insect repellent compounds with odorant binding receptor proteins by in silico molecular docking approach.	2013	Interdiscip Sci	The aim of the study was to identify the interactions between insect repellent compounds and target olfactory proteins. Four compounds, camphor (C10H16O), carvacrol (C10H14O), oleic acid (C18H34O2) and firmotox (C22H28O5) were chosen as ligands. Seven olfactory proteins of insects with PDB IDs: 3K1E, 1QWV, 1TUJ, 1OOF, 2ERB, 3R1O and OBP1 were chosen for docking analysis. Patch dock was used and pymol for visualizing the structures. The interactions of these ligands with few odorant binding proteins showed binding energies. The ligand camphor had showed a binding energy of -136 kcal/mol with OBP1 protein. The ligand carvacrol interacted with 1QWV and 1TUJ proteins with a least binding energy of -117.45 kcal/mol and -21.78 kcal/mol respectively. The ligand oleic acid interacted with 1OOF, 2ERB, 3R1O and OBP1 with least binding energies. Ligand firmotox interacted with OBP1 and showed least binding energies. Three ligands (camphor, oleic acid and firmotox) had one, two, three interactions with a single protein OBP1 of Nilaparvatha lugens (Rice pest). From this in silico study we identified the interaction patterns for insect repellent compounds with the target insect odarant proteins. The results of our study revealed that the chosen ligands showed hydrogen bond interactions with the target olfactory receptor proteins.
24371307	A mutated cytosine deaminase gene, codA (D314A), as an efficient negative selection marker for gene targeting in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Gene targeting (GT) is a powerful tool manipulating a gene of interest in a given genome specifically and precisely. To achieve efficient GT in higher plants, both positive and negative selection markers are required. In particular, a strong negative selection system is needed for enrichment of cells to eliminate those cells in which random integration of the introduced DNA has occurred in GT experiments. Currently, non-conditional negative selection marker genes are used for GT experiments in rice plants, and no conditional negative selection system is available. In this study, we describe the development of an efficient conditional negative selection system in rice plants using Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (codA). We found that a mutant codA gene, codA(D314A), acts more efficiently than the wild-type codA for negative selection in rice plants. The codA(D314A) marker was further used as a negative selection marker for GT experiments in rice. Our conditional negative selection system effectively eliminated the cells in which random integration event(s) occurred; the enrichment factor was approximately 100-fold. This enrichment factor was similar to that found when Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin fragment A was used. Our results suggest the codA(D314A) marker gene as a promising negative selection marker for GT of rice.
24341723	Genome comparison of two Magnaporthe oryzae field isolates reveals genome variations and potential virulence effectors.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice blast caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is an important disease in virtually every rice growing region of the world, which leads to significant annual decreases of grain quality and yield. To prevent disease, resistance genes in rice have been cloned and introduced into susceptible cultivars. However, introduced resistance can often be broken within few years of release, often due to mutation of cognate avirulence genes in fungal field populations.

RESULTS: To better understand the pattern of mutation of M. oryzae field isolates under natural selection forces, we used a next generation sequencing approach to analyze the genomes of two field isolates FJ81278 and HN19311, as well as the transcriptome of FJ81278. By comparing the de novo genome assemblies of the two isolates against the finished reference strain 70-15, we identified extensive polymorphisms including unique genes, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) and indels, structural variations, copy number variations, and loci under strong positive selection. The 1.75 MB of isolate-specific genome content carrying 118 novel genes from FJ81278, and 0.83 MB from HN19311 were also identified. By analyzing secreted proteins carrying polymorphisms, in total 256 candidate virulence effectors were found and 6 were chosen for functional characterization.

CONCLUSIONS: We provide results from genome comparison analysis showing extensive genome variation, and generated a list of M. oryzae candidate virulence effectors for functional characterization.
24454511	Mediterranean Diet and Red Yeast Rice Supplementation for the Management of Hyperlipidemia in Statin-Intolerant Patients with or without Type 2 Diabetes.	2013	Evid Based Complement Alternat Med	Lipid profile could be modified by Mediterranean diet (MD) and by red yeast rice (RYR). We assessed the lipid-lowering effects of MD alone or in combination with RYR on dyslipidemic statin-intolerant subjects, with or without type 2 diabetes, for 24 weeks. We evaluated the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, liver enzyme, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. We studied 171 patients: 46 type 2 diabetic patients treated with MD alone (Group 1), 44 type 2 diabetic patients treated with MD associated with RYR (Group 2), 38 dyslipidemic patients treated with MD alone (Group 3), and 43 dyslipidemic patients treated with MD plus RYR (Group 4). The mean percentage changes in LDL cholesterol from the baseline were -7.34 ± 3.14% (P < 0.05) for Group 1; -21.02 ± 1.63% (P < 0.001) for Group 2; -12.47 ± 1.75% (P < 0.001) for Group 3; and -22 ± 2.19% (P < 0.001) for Group 4 with significant intergroup difference (Group 1 versus Group 2, P < 0.001; Group 3 versus Group 4, P > 0.05). No significant increase in AST, ALT, and CPK levels was observed in all groups. Our results indicate that MD alone is effective in reducing LDL cholesterol levels in statin-intolerant patients with a presumably low cardiovascular risk, but associating MD with the administration of RYR improves patients' LDL cholesterol levels more, and in patients with type 2 diabetes.
24334350	ATTED-II in 2014: evaluation of gene coexpression in agriculturally important plants.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	ATTED-II (http://atted.jp) is a database of coexpressed genes that was originally developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabidopsis and rice. Herein, we describe an updated version of ATTED-II, which expands this resource to include additional agriculturally important plants. To improve the quality of the coexpression data for Arabidopsis and rice, we included more gene expression data from microarray and RNA sequencing studies. The RNA sequencing-based coexpression data now cover 94% of the Arabidopsis protein-encoding genes, representing a substantial increase from previously available microarray-based coexpression data (76% coverage). We also generated coexpression data for four dicots (soybean, poplar, grape and alfalfa) and one monocot (maize). As both the quantity and quality of expression data for the non-model species are generally poorer than for the model species, we verified coexpression data associated with these new species using multiple methods. First, the overall performance of the coexpression data was evaluated using gene ontology annotations and the coincidence of a genomic feature. Secondly, the reliability of each guide gene was determined by comparing coexpressed gene lists between platforms. With the expanded and newly evaluated coexpression data, ATTED-II represents an important resource for identifying functionally related genes in agriculturally important plants.
24312561	Selective anti-proliferation of HER2-positive breast cancer cells by anthocyanins identified by high-throughput screening.	2013	PLoS One	Overexpressed Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) drives the biology of 20% breast cancer and is a prediction of a poor prognosis for patients. HER2-targeted therapies significantly improve outcomes for HER2-positive patients. Traditional Chinese herbs/medicines have been used to treat breast cancer patients including HER2-positive patients in Asia for decades. Although the traditional medicines demonstrate efficacy in clinics for HER2-positive patients, the mechanism is largely unknown. In this article, we screened a 10,000 natural product library in 6 different cell lines representing breast cancer, and assessed the ability of each drug to cause cytotoxicity through a high-throughput screening approach. We have identified eight natural compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-positive cells. Two of the hit compounds, peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside, are both extracts from black rice. They inhibit the phospho-HER2 and phospho-AKT and were confirmed to induce HER2-psotive breast cancer cells apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments significantly reduced the tumor size and volume in vivo compared to the control group. There is no significant difference of antitumorgenic effects between peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments.
24350905	The tillering phenotype of the rice plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) loss-of-function mutant is associated with strigolactone deficiency.	2014	New Phytol	The significance of plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) in phytoene desaturation and chloroplast function has been demonstrated using PTOX-deficient mutants, particularly in Arabidopsis. However, studies on its role in monocots are lacking. Here, we report cloning and characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) PTOX1 gene. Using Ecotype Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (EcoTILLING) and TILLING as forward genetic tools, we identified the causative mutation of an EMS mutant characterized by excessive tillering, semi-dwarfism and leaf variegation that corresponded to the PTOX1 gene. The tillering and semi-dwarf phenotypes of the ptox1 mutant are similar to phenotypes of known strigolactone (SL)-related rice mutants, and both phenotypic traits could be rescued by application of the synthetic SL GR24. The ptox1 mutant accumulated phytoene in white leaf sectors with a corresponding deficiency in β-carotene, consistent with the expected function of PTOX1 in promoting phytoene desaturase activity. There was also no accumulation of the carotenoid-derived SL ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol in root exudates. Elevated concentrations of auxin were detected in the mutant, supporting previous observations that SL interaction with auxin is important in shoot branching control. Our results demonstrate that PTOX1 is required for both carotenoid and SL synthesis resulting in SL-deficient phenotypes in rice.
24562500	Photosynthetic responses of Oryza sativa L. seedlings to cadmium stress: physiological, biochemical and ultrastructural analyses.	2014	Biometals	In the present study, photosynthetic responses induced by cadmium stress in chlorophyll biosynthesis, photochemical activities, the stability of thylakoid membranes chlorophyll-protein complexes and the chloroplast ultrastructure of the cereal crop Oryza sativa L. were characterized. Cadmium inhibited the biosynthesis of chlorophyll by interfering with activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in the rice seedlings. For the photochemical activities analyses, the extent of the decrease in photosystem II activity was much greater than that in the PS I activity. The variations in the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters also indicated that cadmium toxicity drastically affected the photochemistry of PS II. Biochemical analyses by BN-PAGE and protein immunoblot showed that cadmium toxicity considerably affected the stability of PS II-core, cytb 6 /f, RuBisCO, PSI + LHCI and LHCII (Trimeric). We observed the rate of the thylakoid membranes protein degradation, was mainly at the level of RbcL, PsaA, Lhca1 and D1. In addition, the damages to chloroplast structure and thylakoid stacking analyzed by transmission electron microscopy were indicative of general disarray in the photosynthetic functions exerted by cadmium toxicity. These results are valuable for understanding the biological consequences of heavy metals contamination particularly in soils devoted to organic agriculture.
23512472	A comparative study of competitiveness between different genotypes of weedy rice (Oryza sativa) and cultivated rice.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Competition from weedy rice can cause serious yield losses to cultivated rice. However, key traits that facilitate competitiveness are still not well understood. To explore the mechanisms behind the strong growth and competitive ability, replacement series experiments were established with six genotypes of weedy rice from different regions and one cultivated rice cultivar.

RESULTS: (1) Weedy rice from southern China had the greatest impact on growth and yield of cultivated rice throughout the entire growing season. Weedy rice from the northeast was very competitive during the early vegetative stage while the competitive effects of eastern weedy rice were more detrimental at later crop-growth stages. (2) As the proportion of weedy rice increased, plant height, tillers, above-ground biomass, and yield of cultivated rice significantly declined; the crop always being at disadvantage regardless of proportion. (3) Weedy biotypes with greater diversity as estimated by their Shannon indexes were more detrimental to the growth and yield of cultivated rice.

CONCLUSION: Geographic origin (latitude) of weedy rice biotype, its mixture proportion under competition with the crop and its genetic diversity are determinant factors of the outcome of competition and the associated decline in the rice crop yield. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.
24405887	Silicon mitigates heavy metal stress by regulating P-type heavy metal ATPases, Oryza sativa low silicon genes, and endogenous phytohormones.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Silicon (Si) application has been known to enhance the tolerance of plants against abiotic stresses. However, the protective mechanism of Si under heavy metals contamination is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess the role of Si in counteracting toxicity due to cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) in rice plants (Oryza sativa).

RESULTS: Si significantly improved the growth and biomass of rice plants and reduced the toxic effects of Cd/Cu after different stress periods. Si treatment ameliorated root function and structure compared with non-treated rice plants, which suffered severe root damage. In the presence of Si, the Cd/Cu concentration was significantly lower in rice plants, and there was also a reduction in lipid peroxidation and fatty acid desaturation in plant tissues. The reduced uptake of metals in the roots modulated the signaling of phytohormones involved in responses to stress and host defense, such as abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Furthermore, the low concentration of metals significantly down regulated the mRNA expression of enzymes encoding heavy metal transporters (OsHMA2 and OsHMA3) in Si-metal-treated rice plants. Genes responsible for Si transport (OsLSi1 and OsLSi2), showed a significant up-regulation of mRNA expression with Si treatment in rice plants.

CONCLUSION: The present study supports the active role of Si in the regulation of stresses from heavy metal exposure through changes in root morphology.
24390391	Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 is a central regulator of growth, development, and stress response.	2014	Plant Physiol	Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) has been regarded as an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we investigated functions of Ghd7 in rice growth, development, and environmental response. As a long-day dependent negative regulator of heading date, the degree of phenotypic effect of Ghd7 on heading date and yield traits is quantitatively related to the transcript level and is also influenced by both environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds. Ghd7 regulates yield traits through modulating panicle branching independent of heading date. Ghd7 also regulates plasticity of tiller branching by mediating the PHYTOCHROME B-TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 pathway. Drought, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and high-temperature stress strongly repressed Ghd7 expression, whereas low temperature enhanced Ghd7 expression. Overexpression of Ghd7 increased drought sensitivity, whereas knock-down of Ghd7 enhanced drought tolerance. Gene chip analysis of expression profiles revealed that Ghd7 was involved in the regulation of multiple processes, including flowering time, hormone metabolism, and biotic and abiotic stresses. This study suggests that Ghd7 functions to integrate the dynamic environmental inputs with phase transition, architecture regulation, and stress response to maximize the reproductive success of the rice plant.
24431339	Rice alcohol dehydrogenase 1 promotes survival and has a major impact on carbohydrate metabolism in the embryo and endosperm when seeds are germinated in partially oxygenated water.	2014	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rice (Oryza sativa) has the rare ability to germinate and elongate a coleoptile under oxygen-deficient conditions, which include both hypoxia and anoxia. It has previously been shown that ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (ADH1) is required for cell division and cell elongation in the coleoptile of submerged rice seedlings by means of studies using a rice ADH1-deficient mutant, reduced adh activity (rad). The aim of this study was to understand how low ADH1 in rice affects carbohydrate metabolism in the embryo and endosperm, and lactate and alanine synthesis in the embryo during germination and subsequent coleoptile growth in submerged seedlings.

METHODS: Wild-type and rad mutant rice seeds were germinated and grown under complete submergence. At 1, 3, 5 and 7 d after imbibition, the embryo and endosperm were separated and several of their metabolites were measured and compared.

KEY RESULTS: In the rad embryo, the rate of ethanol fermentation was halved, while lactate and alanine concentrations were 2·4- and 5·7- fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type. Glucose and fructose concentrations in the embryos increased with time in the wild type, but not in the rad mutant. The rad mutant endosperm had lower amounts of the α-amylases RAMY1A and RAMY3D, resulting in less starch degradation and lower glucose concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ADH1 is essential for sugar metabolism via glycolysis to ethanol fermentation in both the embryo and endosperm. In the endosperm, energy is presumably needed for synthesis of the amylases and for sucrose synthesis in the endosperm, as well as for sugar transport to the embryo.
24659905	The effects of the photoperiod-insensitive alleles, <i>se13</i>, <i>hd1</i> and <i>ghd7</i>, on yield components in rice.	2014	Mol Breed	Flowering time is closely associated with grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In temperate regions, seasonal changes in day length (known as the photoperiod) are an important environmental cue for floral initiation. The timing of flowering is important not only for successful reproduction, but also for determining the ideal balance between vegetative growth and reproductive growth duration. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed key flowering time genes responsible for photoperiod sensitivity. In this study, we investigated the effect of three recessive photoperiod-insensitive alleles, se13, hd1 and ghd7, on yield components in rice under Ehd1-deficient genetic background conditions to ensure vegetative growth of each line. We found that se13-bearing plants had fewer panicles, hd1-bearing plants showed decreased grain-filling percentage, and ghd7-bearing plants appeared to have fewer grains per panicle and fewer secondary branches. Our results indicate that the pleiotropic effects of photoperiod-insensitive genes on yield components are independent of short vegetative growth. This will provide critical information which can be used to create photoperiod-insensitive varieties that can be adapted to a wide range of latitudes.
24603605	The trafficking pathway of a wheat storage protein in transgenic rice endosperm.	2014	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The trafficking of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of plant cells is a topic of considerable interest since this organelle serves as an entry point for proteins destined for other organelles, as well as for the ER itself. In the current work, transgenic rice was used to study the pattern and pathway of deposition of the wheat high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin sub-unit (GS) 1Dx5 within the rice endosperm using specific antibodies to determine whether it is deposited in the same or different protein bodies from the rice storage proteins, and whether it is located in the same or separate phases within these.

METHODS: The protein distribution and the expression pattern of HMW sub-unit 1Dx5 in transgenic rice endosperm at different stages of development were determined using light and electron microscopy after labelling with antibodies.

KEY RESULTS: The use of HMW-GS-specific antibodies showed that sub-unit 1Dx5 was expressed mainly in the sub-aleurone cells of the endosperm and that it was deposited in both types of protein body present in the rice endosperm: derived from the ER and containing prolamins, and derived from the vacuole and containing glutelins. In addition, new types of protein bodies were also formed within the endosperm cells.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the HMW 1Dx5 protein could be trafficked by either the ER or vacuolar pathway, possibly depending on the stage of development, and that its accumulation in the rice endosperm could compromise the structural integrity of protein bodies and their segregation into two distinct populations in the mature endosperm.
23996324	Water deficit and aluminum tolerance are associated with a high antioxidative enzyme capacity in Indica rice seedlings.	2014	Protoplasma	Plant growth and productivity are greatly affected due to changes in the environmental conditions. In the present investigation, the interactive effects of two important abiotic stresses, i.e., water deficit and Al toxicity, were examined in the seedlings of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs. Malviya-36 (water deficit/Al sensitive) and Vandana (water deficit/Al tolerant). When 15 days grown seedlings were exposed to water deficit (created with 15 % polyethylene glycol 6000) or Al (1 mM AlCl3) treatment or both the treatments together for 48 h, the lengths of root/shoot, relative water content, and chlorophyll greatly declined in the seedlings of the sensitive cultivar, whereas in the tolerant seedlings, either little or insignificant decline in these parameters was observed due to the treatments. Seedlings subjected to water deficit or Al treatment alone or in combination showed increased intensity of the isoenzyme activity bands of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in in-gel activity staining studies. Water deficit caused decrease in intensity of catalase (CAT) activity bands; however, when seedlings were exposed to AlCl3 alone or in combination with water deficit, the intensity of the CAT isoforms increased in both the rice cultivars. The level of expression of the activity bands of SOD, CAT, GPX, and APX was always higher in the seedlings of tolerant cv. Vandana compared to the sensitive cv. Malviya-36 under both controls as well as stress treatments. Higher intensity of isozymes representing higher activity levels of antioxidative enzymes in the rice seedlings and their further increase under water deficit, Al exposure, or in combination of both the stresses appears to serve as useful marker for specifying a combination of water deficit and Al tolerance in rice.
24400898	DELLA activity is required for successful pollen development in the Columbia ecotype of Arabidopsis.	2014	New Phytol	Excessive gibberellin (GA) signalling, mediated through the DELLA proteins, has a negative impact on plant fertility. Loss of DELLA activity in the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) causes complete male sterility, but not in the dicot model Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler), in which DELLA function has been studied most extensively, leading to the assumption that DELLA activity is not essential for Arabidopsis pollen development. A novel DELLA fertility phenotype was identified in the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype that necessitates re-evaluation of the general conclusions drawn from Ler. Fertility phenotypes were compared between the Col-0 and Ler ecotypes under conditions of chemical and genetic GA overdose, including mutants in both ecotypes lacking the DELLA paralogues REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI). Ler displays a less severe fertility phenotype than Col-0 under GA treatment. Col-0 rga gai mutants, in contrast with the equivalent Ler phenotype, were entirely male sterile, caused by post-meiotic defects in pollen development, which were rescued by the reintroduction of DELLA into either the tapetum or developing pollen. We conclude that DELLA activity is essential for Arabidopsis pollen development. Differences between the fertility responses of Col-0 and Ler might be caused by differences in downstream signalling pathways or altered DELLA expression.
24331414	Phosphorus deficiency enhances aluminum tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa) by changing the physicochemical characteristics of root plasma membranes and cell walls.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The negative charge at the root surface is mainly derived from the phosphate group of phospholipids in plasma membranes (PMs) and the carboxyl group of pectins in cell walls, which are usually neutralized by calcium (Ca) ions contributing to maintain the root integrity. The major toxic effect of aluminum (Al) in plants is the inhibition of root elongation due to Al binding tightly to these negative sites in exchange for Ca. Because phospholipid and pectin concentrations decrease in roots of some plant species under phosphorus (P)-limiting conditions, we hypothesized that rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings grown under P-limiting conditions would demonstrate enhanced Al tolerance because of their fewer sites on their roots. For pretreatment, rice seedlings were grown in a culture solution with (+P) or without (-P) P. Thereafter, the seedlings were transferred to a solution with or without Al, and the lipid, pectin, hemicellulose, and mineral concentrations as well as Al tolerance were then determined. Furthermore, the low-Ca tolerance of P-pretreated seedlings was investigated under different pH conditions. The concentrations of phospholipids and pectins in the roots of rice receiving -P pretreatment were lower than those receiving +P pretreatment. As expected, seedlings receiving the -P pretreatment showed enhanced Al tolerance, accompanied by the decrease in Al accumulation in their roots and shoots. This low P-induced enhanced Al tolerance was not explained by enhanced antioxidant activities or organic acid secretion from roots but by the decrease in phospholipid and pectin concentrations in the roots. In addition, low-Ca tolerance of the roots was enhanced by the -P pretreatment under low pH conditions. This low P-induced enhancement of low-Ca tolerance may be related to the lower Ca requirement to maintain PM and cell wall structures in roots of rice with fewer phospholipids and pectins.
24368504	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	The importance of SPX-domain-containing proteins to phosphate (Pi) homeostasis and signalling transduction has been established in plants. In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPX3 and OsSPX5 (SPX3/5) are paralogous SPX genes ( SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) in cereal crops. SPX3/5 are specifically responsive to Pi starvation at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Similar tissue expression patterns of the two genes and proteins were identified by in situ hybridization and the transgenic plants harbouring SPX3pro-SPX3-GUS or SPX5pro-SPX5-GUS fusions, respectively. Both SPX3/5 are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm in rice protoplasts and plants. SPX3/5 negatively regulate root-to-shoot Pi translocation with redundant function. The data showed that the Pi-starvation-accumulated SPX3/5 proteins are players in restoring phosphate balance following phosphate starvation. In vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction analyses indicated that these two proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, also implying their functional redundancy. Genetic interaction analysis indicated that SPX3/5 are functional repressors of OsPHR2 (PHR2), the rice orthologue of the central regulator AtPHR1 for Pi homeostasis and Pi signalling. These results suggest that the evolution of the additional redundant paralogous SPX genes is beneficial to plants recovering Pi homeostasis after Pi starvation by PHR2 pathway.
24467890	Enhanced resistance to blast fungus in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by expressing the ribosome-inactivating protein α-momorcharin.	2014	Plant Sci	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the three major diseases that seriously affect the rice production. Alpha-momorcharin (α-MC), a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) isolated from Momordica charantia seeds, has antifungal effects in vitro. In this study, the α-MC gene was constitutively expressed under the control of the 2×35S promoter in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method. The nine transgenic plants were obtained and confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR, and the four (B2, B4, B7 and B9) of them whose copy numbers were 1, 2, 3 and 3, respectively, were shown to express the α-MC protein by Western blot. The molecular weight of α-MC in transgenic plants was approximately 38 kDa larger than the purified α-MC protein (28 kDa) in vitro. When the confirmed T1 generations were inoculated with a suspension of M. grisea spores for ten days, the lesions on leaves of transgenic plants were much lesser than those found on wild type (WT). According to the criteria of International Rice Research Institute standard, the mean values for morbidity and disease index numbers were 29.8% and 14.9%, respectively, which were lower than for WT. It is unclear whether RIPs could impact plant fitness and however our results suggest that the α-MC protein is an effective antifungal protein preventing rice blast in transgenic rice.
24482599	Large-scale production and evaluation of marker-free <i>indica</i> rice IR64 expressing phytoferritin genes.	2014	Mol Breed	Biofortification of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using a transgenic approach to increase the amount of iron in the grain is proposed as a low-cost, reliable, and sustainable solution to help developing countries combat anemia. In this study, we generated and evaluated a large number of rice or soybean ferritin over-accumulators in rice mega-variety IR64, including marker-free events, by introducing soybean or rice ferritin genes into the endosperm for product development. Accumulation of the protein was confirmed by ELISA, in situ immunological detection, and Western blotting. As much as a 37- and 19-fold increase in the expression of ferritin gene in single and co-transformed plants, respectively, and a 3.4-fold increase in Fe content in the grain over the IR64 wild type was achieved using this approach. Agronomic characteristics of a total of 1,860 progenies from 58 IR64 single independent transgenic events and 768 progenies from 27 marker-free transgenic events were evaluated and most trait characteristics did not show a penalty. Grain quality evaluation of high-Fe IR64 transgenic events showed quality similar to that of the wild-type IR64. To understand the effect of transgenes on iron homeostasis, transcript analysis was conducted on a subset of genes involved in iron uptake and loading. Gene expression of the exogenous ferritin gene in grain correlates with protein accumulation and iron concentration. The expression of NAS2 and NAS3 metal transporters increased during the grain milky stage.
24486490	Classification and interaction modes of 40 rice E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes with 17 rice ARM-U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Rice, a monocot model crop, contains at least 48 putative E2 ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzymes. Based on homology comparisons with 40 Arabidopsis E2 proteins and 35 human E2s, 48 rice E2s were classified into 15 different groups. Yeast two-hybrid analyses using the U-box-domain regions of armadillo (ARM)-U-box E3 Ub-ligases and the Ub-conjugating (UBC) domains of E2s showed that, among 40 rice E2s, 11 E2s accounted for 70% of the interactions with 17 ARM-U-box E3s. Thus, a single E2 could interact with multiple ARM-U-box E3s, suggesting the presence of E2 hubs for E2-E3 interactions in rice. Rice SPL11 ARM-U-box E3 displayed distinct self-ubiquitination patterns, including poly-ubiquitination, mono-ubiquitination, or no ubiquitination, depending on different E2 partners. This suggests that the mode of ubiquitination of SPL11 E3 is critically influenced by individual E2s.
24474809	Overexpression of PYL5 in rice enhances drought tolerance, inhibits growth, and modulates gene expression.	2014	J Exp Bot	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays important roles in the regulation of seed dormancy and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Previous work identified OsPYL/RCARs as functional ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Oryza sativa. OsPYL/RCARs thus are considered to be good candidate genes for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops. This work demonstrates that the cytosolic ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR5 in O. sativa functions as a positive regulator of abiotic stress-responsive gene expression. The constitutive expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 in rice driven by the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter induced the expression of many stress-responsive genes even under normal growth conditions and resulted in improved drought and salt stress tolerance in rice. However, it slightly reduced plant height under paddy field conditions and severely reduced total seed yield. This suggests that, although exogenous expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 is able to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice, fine regulation of its expression will be required to avoid deleterious effects on agricultural traits.
24491154	Multiple major QTL lead to stable yield performance of rice cultivars across varying drought intensities.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Availability of irrigation water is becoming a major limiting factor in rice cultivation. Production in rainfed areas is affected in particular by drought events, as these areas are commonly planted to high-yielding drought-susceptible rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties. The use of bulk segregant analysis (BSA), taking grain yield (GY) as a selection criterion, has resulted in the identification of several large-effect QTL. A QTL mapping study was undertaken on a BC1F3:4 population developed from the cross IR55419-04/2*TDK1 with the aim of identifying large-effect QTL in the background of TDK1, a popular variety from Lao PDR.

RESULTS: The study identified three QTL-qDTY3.1 (RM168-RM468), qDTY6.1 (RM586-RM217), and qDTY6.2 (RM121-RM541)-for grain yield under drought. qDTY3.1 and qDTY6.1, showed consistent effect across seasons under lowland drought-stress conditions while qDTY6.1 and qDTY6.2 showed effect under both upland and lowland drought conditions. The test of QTL effect, conducted through a QTL class analysis, showed the complimentary nature of qDTY3.1 and qDTY6.1. Both QTL showed specific patterns of effect across different maturity groups within the mapping population and higher stability for grain yield was seen across stress levels for lines with both QTLs as compared to those with single or no QTL.

CONCLUSIONS: The study offers a clear understanding of large-effect QTL for grain yield under drought and their effect as individual QTL and in various combinations. The study also opens up an opportunity to develop a drought-tolerant version of TDK1 through marker-assisted backcross breeding and has led to a large-scale QTL pyramiding program aiming to combine these QTL with Sub1 in the background of TDK1 as recipient variety.
24498428	The rice semi-dwarf mutant sd37, caused by a mutation in CYP96B4, plays an important role in the fine-tuning of plant growth.	2014	PLoS One	Plant cytochrome P450 has diverse roles in developmental processes and in the response to environmental cues. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map-based cloning and a complementation test. A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant. Examination of the subcellular localization of the protein revealed that SD37 was ER-localized protein. And SD37 was predominantly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing leaf and root maturation zone but not in the root apical meristem. The sd37 leaves, panicles, and seeds were smaller than those of the wild type. Histological analysis further revealed that a decrease in cell number in the mutant, specifically in the shoots, was the main cause of the dwarf phenotype. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division-related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant. In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height. These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice.
24383761	Improvement of marker-based predictability of Apparent Amylose Content in japonica rice through GBSSI allele mining.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Apparent Amylose Content (AAC), regulated by the Waxy gene, represents the key determinant of rice cooking properties. In occidental countries high AAC rice represents the most requested market class but the availability of molecular markers allowing specific selection of high AAC varieties is limited.

RESULTS: In this study, the effectiveness of available molecular markers in predicting AAC was evaluated in a collection of 127 rice accessions (125 japonica ssp. and 2 indica ssp.) characterized by AAC values from glutinous to 26%. The analyses highlighted the presence of several different allelic patterns identifiable by a few molecular markers, and two of them, i.e., the SNPs at intron1 and exon 6, were able to explain a maximum of 79.5% of AAC variation. However, the available molecular markers haplotypes did not provide tools for predicting accessions with AAC higher than 24.5%. To identify additional polymorphisms, the re-sequencing of the Waxy gene and 1kbp of the putative upstream regulatory region was performed in 21 genotypes representing all the AAC classes identified. Several previously un-characterized SNPs were identified and four of them were used to develop dCAPS markers.

CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the SNPs newly identified slightly increased the AAC explained variation and allowed the identification of a haplotype almost unequivocally associated to AAC higher than 24.5%. Haplotypes at the waxy locus were also associated to grain length and length/width (L/W) ratio. In particular, the SNP at the first intron, which identifies the Wxa and Wxb alleles, was associated with differences in the width of the grain, the L/W ratio and the length of the kernel, most likely as a result of human selection.
24323250	Early physiological and biochemical responses of rice seedlings to low concentration of microcystin-LR.	2014	Ecotoxicology	Microcystin-leucine and arginine (microcystin-LR) is a cyanotoxin produced by cyanobacteria like Microcystis aeruginosa, and it's considered a threat to water quality, agriculture, and human health. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a plant of great importance in human food consumption and economy, with extensive use around the world. It is therefore important to assess the possible effects of using water contaminated with microcystin-LR to irrigate rice crops, in order to ensure a safe, high quality product to consumers. In this study, 12 and 20-day-old plants were exposed during 2 or 7 days to a M. aeruginosa extract containing environmentally relevant microcystin-LR concentrations, 0.26-78 μg/L. Fresh and dry weight of roots and leaves, chlorophyll fluorescence, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and protein identification by mass spectrometry through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from root and leaf tissues, were evaluated in order to gauge the plant's physiological condition and biochemical response after toxin exposure. Results obtained from plant biomass, chlorophyll fluorescence, and enzyme activity assays showed no significant differences between control and treatment groups. However, proteomics data indicates that plants respond to M. aeruginosa extract containing environmentally relevant microcystin-LR concentrations by changing their metabolism, responding differently to different toxin concentrations. Biological processes most affected were related to protein folding and stress response, protein biosynthesis, cell signalling and gene expression regulation, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism which may denote a toxic effect induced by M. aeruginosa extract and microcystin-LR. The implications of the metabolic alterations in plant physiology and growth require further elucidation.
24511289	Origins and evolution of WUSCHEL-related homeobox protein family in plant kingdom.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) is a large group of transcription factors specifically found in plants. WOX members contain the conserved homeodomain essential for plant development by regulating cell division and differentiation. However, the evolutionary relationship of WOX members in plant kingdom remains to be elucidated. In this study, we searched 350 WOX members from 50 species in plant kingdom. Linkage analysis of WOX protein sequences demonstrated that amino acid residues 141-145 and 153-160 located in the homeodomain are possibly associated with the function of WOXs during the evolution. These 350 members were grouped into 3 clades: the first clade represents the conservative WOXs from the lower plant algae to higher plants; the second clade has the members from vascular plant species; the third clade has the members only from spermatophyte species. Furthermore, among the members of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, we observed ubiquitous expression of genes in the first clade and the diversified expression pattern of WOX genes in distinct organs in the second clade and the third clade. This work provides insight into the origin and evolutionary process of WOXs, facilitating their functional investigations in the future.
24656333	Shedding light onto nutrient responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants: nutrient interactions may lead to unpredicted outcomes of the symbiosis.	2014	Plant Sci	The role and importance of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) in plant nitrogen (N) nutrition is uncertain. We propose that this be clarified by using more integrative experimental designs, with the use of a gradient of N supply and the quantification of an extensive array of plant nutrient contents. Using such an experimental design, we investigated AM effects on plant N nutrition, whether the mycorrhizal N response (MNR) determines the mycorrhizal growth response (MGR), and how MNR influences plants' C economy. Oryza sativa plants were inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis or Funneliformis mossae. AM effects were studied along a gradient of N supplies. Biomass, photosynthesis, nutrient and starch contents, mycorrhizal colonization and OsPT11 gene expression were measured. C investment in fungal growth was estimated. Results showed that, in rice, MGR was dependent on AM nutrient uptake effects, namely on the synergy between N and Zn, and not on C expenditure. The supply of C to the fungus was dependent on the plant's nutrient demand, indicated by high shoot C/N or low %N. We conclude that one of the real reasons for the negative MGR of rice, Zn deficiency of AMF plants, would have remained hidden without an experimental design allowing the observation of plants' response to AM along gradients of nutrient concentrations. Adopting more integrative and comprehensive experimental approaches in mycorrhizal studies seems therefore essential if we are to achieve a true understanding of AM function, namely of the mechanisms of C/N exchange regulation in AM.
24566471	Expression and interaction of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) in rice in response to heat stress.	2014	Biochim Biophys Acta	The inherent immobility of rice (Oryza sativa L.) limited their abilities to avoid heat stress and required them to contend with heat stress through innate defense abilities in which heat shock proteins played important roles. In this study, Hsp26.7, Hsp23.2, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.4 and Hsp16.9A were up-regulated in Nipponbare during seedling and anthesis stages in response to heat stress. Subsequently, the expressing levels of these five sHsps in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar, Co39, were all significantly higher than that in the heat-susceptible rice cultivar, Azucena. This indicated that the expressive level of these five sHsps was positively related to the ability of rice plants to avoid heat stress. Thus, the expression level of these five sHsps can be regarded as bio-markers for screening rice cultivars with different abilities to avoid heat stress. Hsp18.1, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A, in the three rice cultivars under heat stress were found to be involved in one protein complex by Native-PAGE, and the interactions of Hsp18.1 and Hsp 17.7, Hsp18.1 and Hsp 17.9A, and Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A were further validated by yeast 2-hybridization. Pull down assay also confirmed the interaction between Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A in rice under heat stress. In conclusion, the up-regulation of the 5 sHsps is a key step for rice to tolerate heat stress, after that some sHsps assembled into a large hetero-oligomeric complex. In addition, through protein-protein interaction, Hsp101 regulated thiamine biosynthesis, and Hsp82 homology affected nitrogen metabolism, while Hsp81-1 were involved in the maintenance of sugar or starch synthesis in rice plants under heat stress. These results provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of sHsps in rice.
24316011	Hydrogen peroxide regulated photosynthesis in C4-pepc transgenic rice.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	In this study, we investigated the photosynthetic physiological basis in 'PC' transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.), showing high-level expression of the gene encoding C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pepc), by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The C4-PEPC gene (pepc) from maize in the transgenic rice plants was checked by PCR. Comparison of yield components and photosynthetic indices between PC and untransformed wild-type (WT) plants indicated that increased yield in PC was associated with higher net photosynthetic rate and higher activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). Both PC and WT plants were treated with 1 mmol L(-1) abscisic acid (ABA), 0.04% 1-butanol (BA), 2 mmol L(-1) neomycin (NS), or 2 mmol L(-1) diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) to investigate the relationship between photosynthesis and levels of H2O2 and phosphatidic acid. In both PC and WT, ABA induced H2O2 generation and simultaneous decrease in stomatal conductance (g(s)). PC plants treated with BA showed decreased H2O2 content and strongly increased g(s) within 2 h of treatment. Similar results were observed in response to DPI treatment in PC. However, WT did not observe the decrease of H2O2 during the treatments of BA and DPI. The reduced H2O2 content in PC caused by BA treatment differed to that induced by DPI because BA did not inhibit NADPH oxidase activities. While BA induced a larger PEPC activity in PC, and higher catalase activity as well. These results indicated that the regulation of endogenous H2O2 metabolism of PC could be helpful for enhancing photosynthetic capability.
24335508	Multiple rice microRNAs are involved in immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	Plant Physiol	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are indispensable regulators for development and defense in eukaryotes. However, the miRNA species have not been explored for rice (Oryza sativa) immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the most devastating fungal pathogen in rice production worldwide. Here, by deep sequencing small RNA libraries from susceptible and resistant lines in normal conditions and upon M. oryzae infection, we identified a group of known rice miRNAs that were differentially expressed upon M. oryzae infection. They were further classified into three classes based on their expression patterns in the susceptible japonica line Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu and in the resistant line International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake that contains a single resistance gene locus, Pyricularia-Kanto 51-m (Pikm), within the Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu background. RNA-blot assay of nine of them confirmed sequencing results. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the expression of some target genes was negatively correlated with the expression of miRNAs. Moreover, transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR160a and miR398b displayed enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, as demonstrated by decreased fungal growth, increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation at the infection site, and up-regulated expression of defense-related genes. Taken together, our data indicate that miRNAs are involved in rice immunity against M. oryzae and that overexpression of miR160a or miR398b can enhance rice resistance to the disease.
24309107	Expression analysis of histone acetyltransferases in rice under drought stress.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Histone acetylation is one of the vital reversible modifications of chromatin structure that regulates gene expression in eukaryotes. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain the homeostasis of histone acetylation. Studies in Arabidopsis have revealed that HATs are involved in plant responses to various stresses including light, temperature, salt and ABA. Drought stress, a very common environmental stress, could cause a range of physiological and biochemical responses in plants involving HATs. Eight HATs in four different families (CBP, GNAT, MYST, and TAF(II)250 family) are known in rice. In this research, four OsHATs, one from each family, were chosen based on in silico domain and promoter analysis for their response under drought conditions. Drought stress was introduced to two-leaf-stage rice seedlings. The effectiveness of drought treatment was confirmed by the measurement of relative water content (RWC). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that drought stress caused a significant increase in the expression of four HATs (OsHAC703, OsHAG703, OsHAF701 and OsHAM701) in rice plants. Additionally, the Western-blot analysis showed that the acetylation level on certain lysine sites of H3 (lysine 9, lysine 18 and lysine 27) and H4 (lysine 5) increased with OsHATs expression. The significant increase in the transcript levels of OsHATs and the acetylation level of lysine residues on Histone H3 and H4 suggest that OsHATs are involved in drought stress responses in rice.
24393121	Genomic, regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms underlying duplicated gene evolution in the natural allotetraploid Oryza minuta.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Polyploid species contribute to Oryza diversity. However, the mechanisms underlying gene and genome evolution in Oryza polyploids remain largely unknown. The allotetraploid Oryza minuta, which is estimated to have formed less than one million years ago, along with its putative diploid progenitors (O. punctata and O. officinalis), are quite suitable for the study of polyploid genome evolution using a comparative genomics approach.

RESULTS: Here, we performed a comparative study of a large genomic region surrounding the Shattering4 locus in O. minuta, as well as in O. punctata and O. officinalis. Duplicated genomes in O. minuta have maintained the diploid genome organization, except for several structural variations mediated by transposon movement. Tandem duplicated gene clusters are prevalent in the Sh4 region, and segmental duplication followed by random deletion is illustrated to explain the gene gain-and-loss process. Both copies of most duplicated genes still persist in O. minuta. Molecular evolution analysis suggested that these duplicated genes are equally evolved and mostly manipulated by purifying selection. However, cDNA-SSCP analysis revealed that the expression patterns were dramatically altered between duplicated genes: nine of 29 duplicated genes exhibited expression divergence in O. minuta. We further detected one gene silencing event that was attributed to gene structural variation, but most gene silencing could not be related to sequence changes. We identified one case in which DNA methylation differences within promoter regions that were associated with the insertion of one hAT element were probably responsible for gene silencing, suggesting a potential epigenetic gene silencing pathway triggered by TE movement.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in duplicated gene silencing in the allotetraploid O. minuta.
24485312	CPPU elevates photosynthetic abilities, growth performances and yield traits in salt stressed rice (Oryza sativa L. spp. indica) via free proline and sugar accumulation.	2014	Pestic Biochem Physiol	Application of N-2-(chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenyl urea (CPPU) to salt susceptible cultivar of indica rice (cv. PTT1) effected on free proline and soluble sugar accumulation and regulated the physio-morphological responses when subjected to salt stress condition was firstly demonstrated in this study. Soluble sugars, including sucrose, glucose and fructose, in leaf blade and leaf sheath were enriched in 0.1 mM CPPU pretreated plants subsequently exposed to 16.6 dS m(-1) NaCl for 10 days. In the long period (15 days) salt stress, free proline content in the leaf blade and leaf sheath were evidently peaked to act as osmotic adjustment in the salt-stressed plants. In addition, the photosynthetic pigments, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and total carotenoids, were maintained by the functional regulation of soluble sugar and free proline in the cellular levels, thereby leading to higher net photosynthetic rate. Further, the stomatal closure and transpiration rate in CPPU pretreated plants were retained under salt stress, thereby resulting in alleviation of growth performance and yield traits. This study suggested that exogenous application of CPPU may alternatively play effective role to improve the salt tolerant abilities of salt susceptible rice crop.
24601753	A computational model for non-conserved mature miRNAs from the rice genome.	2014	SAR QSAR Environ Res	Several computational approaches employ the high complementarity of plant miRNAs to target mRNAs as a filter to recognize miRNA. Numerous non-conserved miRNAs are known with more recent evolutionary origin as a result of target gene duplication events. We present here a computational model with knowledge inputs from reported non-conserved mature miRNAs of Oryza sativa (rice). Sequence- and structure-based approaches were used to retrieve miRNA features based on rice Argonaute protein and develop a multiple linear regression (MLR) model (r(2) = 0.996, q(2)cv = 0.989) which scored mature miRNAs as predicted by the MaturePred program. The model was validated by scoring test set (q(2) = 0.990) and computationally predicted mature miRNAs as external test set (q(2)test = 0.895). This strategy successfully enhanced the confidence of retrieving most probable non-conserved miRNAs from the rice genome. We anticipate that this computational model would recognize unknown non-conserved miRNA candidates and nurture the current mechanistic understanding of miRNA sorting to unveil the role of non-conserved miRNAs in gene silencing.
24335509	Amyloplast-localized SUBSTANDARD STARCH GRAIN4 protein influences the size of starch grains in rice endosperm.	2014	Plant Physiol	Starch is a biologically and commercially important polymer of glucose and is synthesized to form starch grains (SGs) inside amyloplasts. Cereal endosperm accumulates starch to levels that are more than 90% of the total weight, and most of the intracellular space is occupied by SGs. The size of SGs differs depending on the plant species and is one of the most important factors for industrial applications of starch. However, the molecular machinery that regulates the size of SGs is unknown. In this study, we report a novel rice (Oryza sativa) mutant called substandard starch grain4 (ssg4) that develops enlarged SGs in the endosperm. Enlargement of SGs in ssg4 was also observed in other starch-accumulating tissues such as pollen grains, root caps, and young pericarps. The SSG4 gene was identified by map-based cloning. SSG4 encodes a protein that contains 2,135 amino acid residues and an amino-terminal amyloplast-targeted sequence. SSG4 contains a domain of unknown function490 that is conserved from bacteria to higher plants. Domain of unknown function490-containing proteins with lengths greater than 2,000 amino acid residues are predominant in photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and higher plants but are minor in proteobacteria. The results of this study suggest that SSG4 is a novel protein that influences the size of SGs. SSG4 will be a useful molecular tool for future starch breeding and biotechnology.
24655385	Effect of aluminum on protein oxidation, non-protein thiols and protease activity in seedlings of rice cultivars differing in aluminum tolerance.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The effect of toxic concentrations of aluminum (Al) was investigated on contents of protein-thiols, non-protein and total thiols, protein carbonylation and protease activity in the seedlings of Al-sensitive (Al-S) Indica rice cv. HUR-105 and Al-tolerant (Al-T) cv. Vandana grown in sand cultures. Al treatment of 178 μM and 421 μM for 3-12 days caused a significant decline in the level of protein thiols, rise in non-protein thiols (NPTs) as well as protein carbonyl content and an insignificant alteration in the level of total thiols in cv. HUR-105 seedlings. However, in the seedlings of Al-T cv. Vandana, no significant alteration could be observed on any of these parameters with Al treatment. Al treatment inhibited protease activity in roots, whereas the opposite trend was seen in shoots. New isozymes of protease appeared in shoots of cv. Vandana with increased level of Al treatment. Our results show a link between protein thiols and NPTs and suggest the role of NPTs in the repair and protection of protein thiols. Inhibitory effect of Al on protease activity in roots could be a major reason for Al rhizotoxic effects. Al tolerance in rice appears to be associated with lesser content of protein thiols in roots, smaller amount of carbonylated proteins in roots as well as shoots and higher protease activity in shoots.
24579076	Biochemical and anatomical changes and yield reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under varied salinity regimes.	2014	Biomed Res Int	Five Malaysian rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties, MR33, MR52, MR211, MR219, and MR232, were tested in pot culture under different salinity regimes for biochemical response, physiological activity, and grain yield. Three different levels of salt stresses, namely, 4, 8, and 12 dS m(-1), were used in a randomized complete block design with four replications under glass house conditions. The results revealed that the chlorophyll content, proline, sugar content, soluble protein, free amino acid, and yield per plant of all the genotypes were influenced by different salinity levels. The chlorophyll content was observed to decrease with salinity level but the proline increased with salinity levels in all varieties. Reducing sugar and total sugar increased up to 8 dS m(-1) and decreased up to 12 dS m(-1). Nonreducing sugar decreased with increasing the salinity levels in all varieties. Soluble protein and free amino acid also decreased with increasing salinity levels. Cortical cells of MR211 and MR232 did not show cell collapse up to 8 dS m(-1) salinity levels compared to susceptible checks (IR20 and BRRI dhan29). Therefore, considering all parameters, MR211 and MR232 showed better salinity tolerance among the tested varieties. Both cluster and principal component analyses depict the similar results.
24412201	Root proteome of rice studied by iTRAQ provides integrated insight into aluminum stress tolerance mechanisms in plants.	2014	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: One of the major limitations to crop growth on acid soils is the prevalence of soluble aluminum ions (Al(3+)). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been reported to be highly Al tolerant; however, large-scale proteomic data of rice in response to Al(3+) are still very scanty. Here, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach for comparative analysis of the expression profiles of proteins in rice roots in response to Al(3+) at an early phase. A total of 700 distinct proteins (homologous proteins grouped together) with >95% confidence were identified. Among them, 106 proteins were differentially expressed upon Al(3+) toxicity in sensitive and tolerant cultivars. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was the most significantly up-regulated biochemical process in response to excess Al(3+). The mRNA levels of eight proteins mapped in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were further analyzed by qPCR and the expression levels of all the eight genes were higher in tolerant cultivar than in sensitive cultivar, suggesting that these compounds may promote Al tolerance by modulating the production of available energy. Although the exact roles of these putative tolerance proteins remain to be examined, our data lead to a better understanding of the Al tolerance mechanisms in rice plants through the proteomics approach.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Aluminum (mainly Al(3+)) is one of the major limitations to the agricultural productivity on acid soils and causes heavy yield loss every year. Rice has been reported to be highly Al tolerant; however, the mechanisms of rice Al tolerance are still not fully understood. Here, a combined proteomics, bioinformatics and qPCR analysis revealed that Al(3+) invasion caused complex proteomic changes in rice roots involving energy, stress and defense, protein turnover, metabolism, signal transduction, transport and intracellular traffic, cell structure, cell growth/division, and transcription. Promotion of the glycolytic/gluconeogenetic pathway in roots appeared crucially important for Al tolerance. These results lead to a better understanding of the Al tolerance mechanisms in rice and help to improve plant performance on acid soils, eventually to increase the crop production.
24388528	Importance of the rice TCD9 encoding α subunit of chaperonin protein 60 (Cpn60α) for the chloroplast development during the early leaf stage.	2014	Plant Sci	The chloroplast development governs plant growth and metabolism. This study characterized a novel rice thermo-sensitive chloroplast development 9 (tcd9) mutant, which exhibited the albino phenotype before the 3-leaf stage grown below 24 °C whereas displayed normal green at over 28 °C or even at 20 °C after 5-leaf stage. The obvious decrease in Chl levels, abnormal chloroplasts with few thylakoid lamella and abnormal thylakoids were observed for the albino mutant seedlings at low temperature, but the mutant was apparently normal green at high temperature, suggesting the thermo-sensitivity of albino phenotype. Genetic analysis showed that the albino phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene (tcd9). The map-based cloning and molecular complementation tests revealed that the mutation of TCD9 encoding α subunit of Cpn60 protein (Cpn60α), localized in chloroplasts, was responsible for albino phenotype. In addition, TCD9 exhibited the high expression in all tested tissues, especially in young leaves. The transcriptional analysis indicated that all expression levels of the studied genes related to chloroplast development in tcd9 mutant were seriously affected in the albino seedlings at 20 °C, whereas some of them recovered into normal levels in green-seedlings at 32 °C. Our observations suggest that the nuclear-encoded Cpn60α protein TCD9 plays a crucial role in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
24361403	Genome-wide analysis reveals the expansion of Cytochrome P450 genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism in rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily is a large group of ancient proteins with enzymatic activities involved in various physiological processes. The rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, is an important insect pest in rice production. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 77 CYP genes from rice striped stem borer (SSB) through genome and transcriptome sequence analyses. All these CYP genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Twenty-eight CYP transcripts have full open reading frame (ORF) and four additional transcripts have a nearly full length coding region. The SSB CYP genes were classified into four clans, the mitochondrial, CYP2, CYP3, and CYP4. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there was an apparent expansion of the CYP3 clan in insects. The CYP6AB subfamily of the CYP3 clan had nine members in SSB. Evolutionary analysis showed that this subfamily was expanded only in lepidopteran insects. In this study, we identified a new P450 subfamily, CYP321F, which is unique to SSB and located in the genome as tandem repeats. Our work provided a foundation for future studies on the functions and mechanism of P450s in the destructive rice pest.
24388867	Quantitation of the residual DNA from rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin.	2014	Anal Biochem	Residual DNA in recombinant protein pharmaceuticals can potentially cause safety issues in clinical applications; thus, maximum residual limit has been established by drug safety authorities. Assays for residual DNA in Escherichia coli, yeast, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression systems have been established, but no rice residual DNA assay for rice expression systems has been designed. To develop an assay for the quantification of residual DNA that is produced from rice seed, we established a sensitive assay using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on the 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. We found that a 40-cycle qPCR exhibited a linear response when the template concentration was in the range of 2×10(4) to 0.2pg of DNA per reaction in TaqMan and SYBR Green I assays. The amplification efficiency was 103 to 104%, and the amount of residual DNA from recombinant human serum albumin from Oryza sativa (OsrHSA) was less than 3.8ng per dosage, which was lower than that recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Our results indicate that the current purification protocol could efficiently remove residual DNA during manufacturing and processing. Furthermore, this protocol could be viable in other cereal crop endosperm expression systems for developing a residual DNA quantitation assay using the highly conserved 5S rRNA gene of the crops.
24380819	Application of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) produced in rice (Oryza sativa L.) for maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cells.	2014	J Biotechnol	Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into any somatic cell type, and thus have potential to treat a number of diseases that are currently incurable. Application of these cells for clinical or industrial uses would require an increase in production to yield adequate numbers of viable cells. However, the relatively high costs of cytokines and growth factors required for maintenance of stem cells in the undifferentiated state have the potential to limit translational research. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, is a key regulator in the maintenance of naïve states for both human and mouse stem cells. In this study, we describe a new recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) using a plant-based (rice) expression system. We found that rice-derived rhLIF possessed the same specific activity as commercial Escherichia coli-derived LIF and was capable of supporting mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation in the undifferentiated state as evidenced from pluripotency marker level analysis. Retention of the pluripotent state was found to be indistinguishable between rice-derived rhLIF and other recombinant LIF proteins currently on the market.
11244110	Mutator transposase is widespread in the grasses.	2001	Plant Physiol	Although the Mutator (Mu) system is well characterized in maize (Zea mays), very little is known about this highly mutagenic system of transposons in other grasses. Mutator is regulated by the MuDR class of elements, which encodes two genes, one of which, mudrA, has similarity to a number of bacterial transposases. Experiments in our laboratory, as well as database searches, demonstrate that mudrA sequences are ubiquitous and diverse in the grasses. In several species it is clear that multiple paralogous elements can be present in a single genome. In some species such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), mudrA-similar sequences are represented in cDNA databases, suggesting the presence of active Mu transposon systems in these species. Further, in rice and in sorghum, mudrA-like genes are flanked by long terminal inverted repeats, as well as the short host sequence direct repeats diagnostic of insertion. Thus, there is ample evidence that systems related to Mu in maize are at least potentially active in a wide variety of grasses. However, the mudrB gene, though important for Mu activity in maize, is not necessarily a component of Mu elements in other grasses.

11847307	The RAR1 interactor SGT1, an essential component of R gene-triggered disease resistance.	2002	Science	Plant disease resistance (R) genes trigger innate immune responses upon pathogen attack. RAR1 is an early convergence point in a signaling pathway engaged by multiple R genes. Here, we show that RAR1 interacts with plant orthologs of the yeast protein SGT1, an essential regulator in the cell cycle. Silencing the barley gene Sgt1 reveals its role in R gene-triggered, Rar1-dependent disease resistance. SGT1 associates with SKP1 and CUL1, subunits of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, the RAR1-SGT1 complex also interacts with two COP9 signalosome components. The interactions among RAR1, SGT1, SCF, and signalosome subunits indicate a link between disease resistance and ubiquitination.
23671845	Conservation, Divergence, and Genome-Wide Distribution of PAL and POX A Gene Families in Plants.	2013	Int J Genomics	Genome-wide identification and phylogenetic and syntenic comparison were performed for the genes responsible for phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase A (POX A) enzymes in nine plant species representing very diverse groups like legumes (Glycine max and Medicago truncatula), fruits (Vitis vinifera), cereals (Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa), trees (Populus trichocarpa), and model dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) species. A total of 87 and 1045 genes in PAL and POX A gene families, respectively, have been identified in these species. The phylogenetic and syntenic comparison along with motif distributions shows a high degree of conservation of PAL genes, suggesting that these genes may predate monocot/eudicot divergence. The POX A family genes, present in clusters at the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes, might be evolving and expanding with higher rate than the PAL gene family. Our analysis showed that during the expansion of POX A gene family, many groups and subgroups have evolved, resulting in a high level of functional divergence among monocots and dicots. These results will act as a first step toward the understanding of monocot/eudicot evolution and functional characterization of these gene families in the future.
24884360	Molecular evolution and functional characterisation of an ancient phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene (NnPAL1) from Nelumbo nucifera: novel insight into the evolution of the PAL family in angiosperms.	2014	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; E.C.4.3.1.5) is a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plant development, and it catalyses the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, leading to the production of secondary metabolites. This enzyme has been identified in many organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to higher plants. Because Nelumbo nucifera is a basal dicot rich in many secondary metabolites, it is a suitable candidate for research on the phenylpropanoid pathway.

RESULTS: Three PAL members, NnPAL1, NnPAL2 and NnPAL3, have been identified in N. nucifera using genome-wide analysis. NnPAL1 contains two introns; however, both NnPAL2 and NnPAL3 have only one intron. Molecular and evolutionary analysis of NnPAL1 confirms that it is an ancient PAL member of the angiosperms and may have a different origin. However, PAL clusters, except NnPAL1, are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. These observations suggest that duplication events remain an important occurrence in the evolution of the PAL gene family. Molecular assays demonstrate that the mRNA of the NnPAL1 gene is 2343 bp in size and encodes a 717 amino acid polypeptide. The optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant NnPAL1 protein are 9.0 and 55°C, respectively. The NnPAL1 protein retains both PAL and weak TAL catalytic activities with Km values of 1.07 mM for L-phenylalanine and 3.43 mM for L-tyrosine, respectively. Cis-elements response to environmental stress are identified and confirmed using real-time PCR for treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), ultraviolet light, Neurospora crassa (fungi) and drought.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the angiosperm PAL genes are not derived from a single gene in an ancestral angiosperm genome; therefore, there may be another ancestral duplication and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. The different evolutionary histories for PAL genes in angiosperms suggest different mechanisms of functional regulation. The expression patterns of NnPAL1 in response to stress may be necessary for the survival of N. nucifera since the Cretaceous Period. The discovery and characterisation of the ancient NnPAL1 help to elucidate PAL evolution in angiosperms.
20862311	Rice Snl6, a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase-like gene family member, is required for NH1-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2010	PLoS Genet	Rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1) is a key mediator of innate immunity. In both plants and animals, the innate immune response is often accompanied by rapid cell death at the site of pathogen infection. Over-expression of NH1 in rice results in resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), constitutive expression of defense related genes and enhanced benzothiadiazole (BTH)- mediated cell death. Here we describe a forward genetic screen that identified a suppressor of NH1-mediated lesion formation and resistance, snl6. Comparative genome hybridization and fine mapping rapidly identified the genomic location of the Snl6 gene. Snl6 is a member of the cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR)-like gene family. We show that Snl6 is required for NH1-mediated resistance to Xoo. Further, we show that Snl6 is required for pathogenesis-related gene expression. In contrast to previously described CCR family members, disruption of Snl6 does not result in an obvious morphologic phenotype. Snl6 mutants have reduced lignin content and increased sugar extractability, an important trait for the production of cellulosic biofuels. These results suggest the existence of a conserved group of CCR-like genes involved in the defense response, and with the potential to alter lignin content without affecting development.
11141171	Induction of Ltp (lipid transfer protein) and Pal (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) gene expression in rice roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae.	2000	J Exp Bot	The expression of a lipid transfer protein (LTP) gene is regulated in Oryza sativa roots in response to colonization by the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. Transcript levels increased when the fungus forms appressoria and penetrates the root epidermis and decreased at the onset of the intercellular colonization of the root cortex. The analysis of histochemical GUS staining in transgenic rice plants carrying the Ltp/Gus construct confirm the induction of LTP: gene associated with fungal appressoria formation and penetration area. The induction of Ltp gene expression coincided in time with a transient increase in the expression of a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL:) gene and a transient accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) in the mycorrhizal roots. The expression of LTP: and PAL: was induced in rice roots after treatment with SA and Pseudomonas syringae indicating that both genes could be implicated in the plant defence response. The exogenous application of SA to rice interacting with the mycorrhizal fungus did not affect appressoria formation but, instead, resulted in a transient delay of root mycorrhization. Nevertheless, although LTP: maintained a prolonged SA-induced expression level, mycorrhizal formation could still proceed.
10875920	Perception of brassinosteroids by the extracellular domain of the receptor kinase BRI1.	2000	Science	An assay was developed to study plant receptor kinase activation and signaling mechanisms. The extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and transmembrane domains of the Arabidopsis receptor kinase BRI1, which is implicated in brassinosteroid signaling, were fused to the serine/threonine kinase domain of XA21, the rice disease resistance receptor. The chimeric receptor initiates plant defense responses in rice cells upon treatment with brassinosteroids. These results, which indicate that the extracellular domain of BRI1 perceives brassinosteroids, suggest a general signaling mechanism for the LRR receptor kinases of plants. This system should allow the discovery of ligands for the LRR kinases, the largest group of plant receptor kinases.
7580258	TATA box and initiator functions in the accurate transcription of a plant minimal promoter in vitro.	1995	Plant Cell	The functional architecture of the proximal region of a rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) promoter was analyzed by transcription of PAL-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) templates by whole-cell extracts of rice cell suspension cultures. The promoter 5' truncated to position -35 was sufficient for accurate initiation of basal transcription. Substitution of the TATTTAA sequence between positions -35 and -28 with GCGGGTT or 2-bp substitutions to give TCGTTAA and TATGGAA inactivated the minimal promoter. Moreover, the function of the TATTTAA sequence was dependent on its position relative to the initiation site; hence, this element is an authentic TATA box essential for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Substitutions in the TCCAAG initiator cis element (-3 to +3) at the -1 (C to A or G) and +1 (A to C or T) residues caused inaccurate initiation, whereas mutations at the other residues of this conserved element or sequence substitutions between the TATA box and initiator had little effect. TATA box and initiator functions were confirmed by analysis of the effects of promoter mutations on expression in stably transformed rice cell suspensions and plants. We concluded that the proximal region of the PAL promoter has a simple functional architecture involving a TATA box appropriately positioned upstream of the initiator. Transcription of derivatives of such minimal promoters by highly active cell extracts should allow molecular analysis of functional interactions between specific cis elements and cognate trans factors.
7599645	Accurate in vitro transcription from circularized plasmid templates by plant whole cell extracts.	1995	Plant J	A convenient in vitro transcription system using monocot and dicot whole cell extracts and circular DNA templates has been developed. The system consists of incubating template and whole cell extract to generate initiation complexes, followed by addition of nucleotide triphosphates to support elongation, and primer extension assay to detect authentic transcripts. This in vitro transcription system required circularized templates and was essentially inactive with linearized templates. Accurate in vitro transcription of a rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion and a tobacco sesquiterpene cyclase promoter-GUS gene fusion was examined in their homologous whole cell extracts, and the optimal concentrations for several reaction components, including DNA template, whole cell extract, monovalent and divalent cations, were determined for specific initiation from the in vivo start site. Transcription was inhibited by low concentrations of alpha-amanitin, demonstrating that the reaction was mediated by RNA polymerase II. Accurate transcription initiation was dependent on the TATA-box motif within the respective promoters. Based on the effect of delayed addition of sarkosyl at a concentration sufficient to inhibit transcription initiation but not elongation, three to four rounds of transcription were initiated in standard assays.
9112783	Molecular cloning of mannose-6-phosphate reductase and its developmental expression in celery.	1997	Plant Physiol	Compared with other primary photosynthetic products (e.g. sucrose and starch), little is known about sugar alcohol metabolism, its regulation, and the manner in which it is integrated with other pathways. Mannose-6-phosphate reductase (M6PR) is a key enzyme that is involved in mannitol biosynthesis in celery (Apium graveolens L.). The M6PR gene was cloned from a leaf cDNA library, and clonal authenticity was established by assays of M6PR activity, western blots, and comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequence with a celery M6PR tryptic digestion product. Recombinant M6PR, purified from Escherichia coli, had specific activity, molecular mass, and kinetic characteristics indistinguishable from those of authentic celery M6PR. Sequence analyses showed M6PR to be a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, which includes both animal and plant enzymes. The greatest sequence similarity was with aldose-6-phosphate reductase (EC 1.1.1.200), a key enzyme in sorbitol synthesis in Rosaceae. Developmental studies showed M6PR to be limited to green tissues and to be under tight transcriptional regulation during leaf initiation, expansion, and maturation. These data confirmed a close relationship between the development of photosynthetic capacity, mannitol synthesis, and M6PR activity.
11169193	Survey of transposable elements from rice genomic sequences.	2001	Plant J	Oryza sativa L. (domesticated rice) is a monocotyledonous plant, and its 430 Mb genome has been targeted for complete sequencing. We performed a high-resolution computer-based survey for transposable elements on 910 Kb of rice genomic DNA sequences. Both class I and II transposable elements were present, contributing 19.9% of the sequences surveyed. Class II elements greatly outnumbered class I elements (166 versus 22), although class I elements made up a greater percentage (12.2% versus 6.6%) of nucleotides surveyed. Several Mutator-like elements (MULEs) were identified, including rice elements that harbor truncated host cellular genes. MITEs (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements) account for 71.6% of the mined transposable elements and are clearly the predominant type of transposable element in the sequences examined. Moreover, a putative Stowaway transposase has been identified based on shared sequence similarity with the mined MITEs and previously identified plant mariner-like elements (MLEs). Members of a group of novel rice elements resembling the structurally unusual members of the Basho family in Arabidopsis suggest a wide distribution of these transposons among plants. Our survey provides a preview of transposable element diversity and abundance in rice, and allows for comparison with genomes of other plant species.
18620041	Genomewide comparative phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of tubby-like protein family in Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar.	2008	Genomics	Tubby-like proteins, which are characterized by a highly conserved tubby domain, play an important role in the maintenance and function of neuronal cells during postdifferentiation and development in mammals. In additional to the tubby domain, most tubby-like proteins in plants also possess an F-box domain. Plants also appear to harbor a large number of TLP genes. To gain insight into how TLP genes evolved in plants, we conducted a comparative phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of the tubby-like protein gene family in Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar. Genomewide screening identified 11 TLP genes in Arabidopsis, 14 in rice, and 11 in poplar. Phylogenetic trees, domain organizations, and intron/exon structures classified this family into three subfamilies and indicated that species-specific expansion contributed to the evolution of this family in plants. We determined that in rice and poplar, the tubby-like protein family had expanded mainly through segmental duplication events. Tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that functional diversification of the duplicated TLP genes was a major feature of long-term evolution. Our results also demonstrated that the tubby and F-box domains had co-evolved during the evolution of proteins containing both domains.
18775973	The F-box gene family is expanded in herbaceous annual plants relative to woody perennial plants.	2008	Plant Physiol	F-box proteins are generally responsible for substrate recognition in the Skp1-Cullin-F-box complexes that are involved in protein degradation via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. In plants, F-box genes influence a variety of biological processes, such as leaf senescence, branching, self-incompatibility, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The number of F-box genes in Populus (Populus trichocarpa; approximately 320) is less than half that found in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; approximately 660) or Oryza (Oryza sativa; approximately 680), even though the total number of genes in Populus is equivalent to that in Oryza and 1.5 times that in Arabidopsis. We performed comparative genomics analysis between the woody perennial plant Populus and the herbaceous annual plants Arabidopsis and Oryza in order to explicate the functional implications of this large gene family. Our analyses reveal interspecific differences in genomic distribution, orthologous relationship, intron evolution, protein domain structure, and gene expression. The set of F-box genes shared by these species appear to be involved in core biological processes essential for plant growth and development; lineage-specific differences primarily occurred because of an expansion of the F-box genes via tandem duplications in Arabidopsis and Oryza. The number of F-box genes in the newly sequenced woody species Vitis (Vitis vinifera; 156) and Carica (Carica papaya; 139) is similar to that in Populus, supporting the hypothesis that the F-box gene family is expanded in herbaceous annual plants relative to woody perennial plants. This study provides insights into the relationship between the structure and composition of the F-box gene family in herbaceous and woody species and their associated developmental and physiological features.
21297981	Phylogenetic comparison of F-Box (FBX) gene superfamily within the plant kingdom reveals divergent evolutionary histories indicative of genomic drift.	2011	PLoS One	The emergence of multigene families has been hypothesized as a major contributor to the evolution of complex traits and speciation. To help understand how such multigene families arose and diverged during plant evolution, we examined the phylogenetic relationships of F-Box (FBX) genes, one of the largest and most polymorphic superfamilies known in the plant kingdom. FBX proteins comprise the target recognition subunit of SCF-type ubiquitin-protein ligases, where they individually recruit specific substrates for ubiquitylation. Through the extensive analysis of 10,811 FBX loci from 18 plant species, ranging from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to numerous monocots and eudicots, we discovered strikingly diverse evolutionary histories. The number of FBX loci varies widely and appears independent of the growth habit and life cycle of land plants, with a little as 198 predicted for Carica papaya to as many as 1350 predicted for Arabidopsis lyrata. This number differs substantially even among closely related species, with evidence for extensive gains/losses. Despite this extraordinary inter-species variation, one subset of FBX genes was conserved among most species examined. Together with evidence of strong purifying selection and expression, the ligases synthesized from these conserved loci likely direct essential ubiquitylation events. Another subset was much more lineage specific, showed more relaxed purifying selection, and was enriched in loci with little or no evidence of expression, suggesting that they either control more limited, species-specific processes or arose from genomic drift and thus may provide reservoirs for evolutionary innovation. Numerous FBX loci were also predicted to be pseudogenes with their numbers tightly correlated with the total number of FBX genes in each species. Taken together, it appears that the FBX superfamily has independently undergone substantial birth/death in many plant lineages, with its size and rapid evolution potentially reflecting a central role for ubiquitylation in driving plant fitness.
19126682	Evolution of F-box genes in plants: different modes of sequence divergence and their relationships with functional diversification.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	F-box proteins are substrate-recognition components of the Skp1-Rbx1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases. In plants, F-box genes form one of the largest multigene superfamilies and control many important biological functions. However, it is unclear how and why plants have acquired a large number of F-box genes. Here we identified 692, 337, and 779 F-box genes in Arabidopsis, poplar and rice, respectively, and studied their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns. We found that the plant F-box superfamily can be divided into 42 families, each of which has a distinct domain organization. We also estimated the number of ancestral genes for each family and identified highly conservative versus divergent families. In conservative families, there has been little or no change in the number of genes since the divergence between eudicots and monocots approximately 145 million years ago. In divergent families, however, the numbers have increased dramatically during the same period. In two cases, the numbers of genes in extant species are >100 times greater than that in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the three species. Proteins encoded by highly conservative genes always have the same domain organization, suggesting that they interact with the same or similar substrates. In contrast, proteins of rapidly duplicating genes sometimes have quite different domain structures, mainly caused by unusually frequent shifts of exon-intron boundaries and/or frameshift mutations. Our results indicate that different F-box families, or different clusters of the same family, have experienced dramatically different modes of sequence divergence, apparently having resulted in adaptive changes in function.
17284833	A new method of defense response analysis using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts.	2007	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We established a new plant defense response assay using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts. The assay system sensitively detected defense induction by flagellin, which had previously been assigned to a specific elicitor. Our assay system provides a rapid and efficient way to dissect rice defense mechanisms.
16272430	Suppression of the floral activator Hd3a is the principal cause of the night break effect in rice.	2005	Plant Cell	A short exposure to light in the middle of the night causes inhibition of flowering in short-day plants. This phenomenon is called night break (NB) and has been used extensively as a tool to study the photoperiodic control of flowering for many years. However, at the molecular level, very little is known about this phenomenon. In rice (Oryza sativa), 10 min of light exposure in the middle of a 14-h night caused a clear delay in flowering. A single NB strongly suppressed the mRNA of Hd3a, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), whereas the mRNAs of OsGI and Hd1 were not affected. The NB effect on Hd3a mRNA was maximal in the middle of the 14-h night. The phyB mutation abolished the NB effect on flowering and Hd3a mRNA, indicating that the NB effect was mediated by phytochrome B. Because expression of the other FT-like genes was very low and not appreciably affected by NB, our results strongly suggest that the suppression of Hd3a mRNA is the principal cause of the NB effect on flowering in rice.
11489174	Light regulation of circadian clock-controlled gene expression in rice.	2001	Plant J	Using transgenic rice seedlings expressing a firefly luciferase (luc) gene under the control of a rice CAB (chlorophyll a/b binding protein) promoter, we demonstrated how light affects circadian clocks in the transcription of the CAB gene. Rhythmic luc expression was observed for more than 5 d under constant light and dark (DD) conditions after light/dark entrainment. After a light pulse was applied at different time points in DD various temporal patterns of CAB gene expression were individually observed. We first examined two distinct properties related to the entrainment mechanism of the circadian clock: fluence-rate dependence of free-running periods (FRPs) and phase resetting by a light pulse. Although fluence-rate dependent shortening of FRP was demonstrated, the FRP in DD was almost equal to that in constant light of a middle fluence-rate, indicating that this fluence-rate dependence may not fully describe the entrainment of the circadian clock in rice. Typical phase responses of the circadian clock by a single light pulse were also observed at the transcriptional level in rice seedlings. Thus, the phase resettings upon the light/dark transitions of daily cycles may be sufficient to explain the entrainment mechanisms of rice. We have further demonstrated that, in addition to having a gating effect to acute response, a light pulse can activate the circadian clock-controlled CAB1R gene expression at the first circadian peak in a phase-dependent manner. This suggests that light activates circadian clock activity in the diurnal CAB gene expression under daily light/dark cycles.
19236476	Genetic architecture for the adaptive origin of annual wild rice, oryza nivara.	2009	Evolution	The wild progenitors of cultivated rice, Oryza nivara and Oryza rufipogon, provide an experimental system for characterizing the genetic basis of adaptation. The evolution of annual O. nivara from a perennial ancestor resembling its sister species, O. rufipogon, was associated with an ecological shift from persistently wet to seasonally dry habitats. Here we report a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of phenotypic differentiation in life history, mating system, and flowering time between O. nivara and O. rufipogon. The exponential distribution of effect sizes of QTL fits the prediction of a recently proposed population genetic model of adaptation. More than 80% of QTL alleles of O. nivara acted in the same direction of phenotypic evolution, suggesting that they were fixed under directional selection. The loss of photoperiod sensitivity, which might be essential to the survival of the ancestral populations of O. nivara in the new environment, was controlled by QTL of relatively large effect. Mating system evolution from cross- to self-fertilization through the modification of panicle and floral morphology was controlled by QTL of small-to-moderate effect. The lack of segregation of the recessive annual habit in the F(2) mapping populations suggested that the evolution of annual from perennial life form had a complex genetic basis. The study captured the genetic architecture for the adaptive origin of O. nivara and provides a foundation for rigorous experimental tests of population genetic theories of adaptation.
8522180	Cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding an 18.0-kDa class-I low-molecular-weight heat-shock protein from rice.	1995	Gene	A novel cDNA clone, Oshp18.0 cDNA, encoding a rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Tainong 67) 18.0-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP), was isolated from a cDNA library of heat-shocked rice seedlings by use of the rice HSP cDNA, Oshsp17.3 cDNA, as a probe. The sequence showed that Oshsp18.0 cDNA contains a 749-bp insert encoding an ORF of 160 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 18.0 kDa and a pI of 7.3. Sequence comparison reveals that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is highly homologous to other low-molecular-weight (LMW) HSP cDNAs. Also, the results of hybrid-selected in vitro translation clearly establish that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is the rice 18.0-kDa LMW HSP-encoding cDNA clone. The recombinant Oshsp18.0 fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli was of the size predicted, and was recognized by the class-I rice 16.9-kDa HSP antiserum. The results suggest that Oshsp18.0 cDNA is an 18.0-kDa class-I LMW HSP- encoding cDNA clone from rice.
9784845	Purification and characterization of sucrose synthase isozymes from etiolated rice seedlings.	1998	Biochem Mol Biol Int	Presence of homo- and hetero-tetrameric rice sucrose synthase (RSS) isoforms in etiolated rice seedlings was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using monospecific antibodies. Three RSS isozymes with various pI values were purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration, DEAE-Sephacel and Mono-Q ion exchange chromatographies. They were characterized as heterotetramers composed of RSS1 and RSS2 subunits. All of them used UDP as the best substrate. The presence of divalent metal ions increased the activities of synthesis but inhibited the cleavage of sucrose.
16669782	Transcriptional regulatory networks in cellular responses and tolerance to dehydration and cold stresses.	2006	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Plant growth and productivity are greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought, high salinity, and low temperature. Expression of a variety of genes is induced by these stresses in various plants. The products of these genes function not only in stress tolerance but also in stress response. In the signal transduction network from perception of stress signals to stress-responsive gene expression, various transcription factors and cis-acting elements in the stress-responsive promoters function for plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Recent progress has been made in analyzing the complex cascades of gene expression in drought and cold stress responses, especially in identifying specificity and cross talk in stress signaling. In this review article, we highlight transcriptional regulation of gene expression in response to drought and cold stresses, with particular emphasis on the role of transcription factors and cis-acting elements in stress-inducible promoters.
24280628	Identifying essential genes/reactions of the rice photorespiration by in silico model-based analysis.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Photorespiration, a highly wasteful process of energy dissipation, depresses the productivity of C3 plants such as rice (Oryza sativa) under dry and hot conditions. Thus, it is highly required to understand the cellular physiology and relevant metabolic states under photorespiration using systems approaches, thereby devising strategies for improving rice production.

FINDINGS: In silico model-driven gene deletion analysis was performed on photorespiring leaf cells under ambient and stressed environmental conditions using our central metabolic network of rice cells. As a result, we identified a number of essential genes for the cell growth across various functional pathways such as photorespiratory cycle, Calvin cycle, GS-GOGAT cycle and sucrose metabolism as well as certain inter-compartmental transporters, which are mostly in good agreement with previous experiments. Synthetic lethal (SL) screening was also performed to identify the pair of non-essential genes whose simultaneous deletion become lethal, revealing the existence of more than 220 pairs of SLs on rice central metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS: The gene deletion and synthetic lethal analyses highlighted the rigid nature of rice photosynthetic pathways and characterized functional interactions between central metabolic genes, respectively. The biological roles of such reported essential genes should be further explored to better understand the rice photorespiration in future.
23752350	Effects of genetically modified T2A-1 rice on the GI health of rats after 90-day supplement.	2013	Sci Rep	Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin (Bt) rice will be commercialized as a main food source. Traditional safety assessments on genetically modified products pay little attention on gastrointestinal (GI) health. More data about GI health of Bt rice must be provided to dispel public' doubts about the potential effects on human health. We constructed an improved safety assessment animal model using a basic subchronic toxicity experiment, measuring a range of parameters including microflora composition, intestinal permeability, epithelial structure, fecal enzymes, bacterial activity, and intestinal immunity. Significant differences were found between rice-fed groups and AIN93G-fed control groups in several parameters, whereas no differences were observed between genetically modified and non-genetically modified groups. No adverse effects were found on GI health resulting from genetically modified T2A-1 rice. In conclusion, this study may offer a systematic safety assessment model for GM material with respect to the effects on GI health.
23661564	Cytoplasmic organelle DNA preferentially inserts into open chromatin.	2013	Genome Biol Evol	DNA transfer from chloroplasts and mitochondria to the nucleus is ongoing in eukaryotes but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Mitochondrial DNA was observed to integrate into the nuclear genome through DNA double-strand break repair in Nicotiana tabacum. Here, 14 nuclear insertions of chloroplast DNA (nupts) that are unique to Oryza sativa subsp. indica were identified. Comparisons with the preinsertion nuclear loci identified in the related subspecies, O. sativa subsp. japonica, which lacked these nupts, indicated that chloroplast DNA had integrated by nonhomologous end joining. Analyzing public DNase-seq data revealed that nupts were significantly more frequent in open chromatin regions of the nucleus. This preference was tested further in the chimpanzee genome by comparing nuclear loci containing integrants of mitochondrial DNA (numts) with their corresponding numt-lacking preinsertion sites in the human genome. Mitochondrial DNAs also tended to insert more frequently into regions of open chromatin revealed by human DNase-seq and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements-seq databases.
24783785	Influence of nutrient composition and plant growth regulators on callus induction and plant regeneration in glutinous rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Pak J Biol Sci	The potential for callus induction and regeneration depends on nutrient composition and plant growth regulators. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of nutrient composition and plant growth regulators on callus induction and plant regeneration in the glutinous rice cultivar Khunvang. The effect of 2,4-D concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg L(-1)) on callus induction and growth were investigated. The results revealed that the highest percentage of callus induction (97%) was observed in MS medium supplemented with 5 mg L(-1) 2,4-D under 16 h Photoperiod. The effects of casein hydrolysate concentrations of casein hydrolysate (0, 300, 500, 700 and 900 mg L(-1)) and proline (0, 300, 500, 700 and 900 mg L(-1)) on callus induction and growth of Khunvang were also observed. The results indicated that the increasing casein hydrolysate and proline concentrations did not show a significant effect on callus growth. However, proline concentration of 900 mg L(-1) yielded 85.67% of callus growth.
23685778	A holistic approach towards defined product attributes by Maillard-type food processing.	2013	Food Funct	A fractional factorial experimental design was used to quantify the impact of process and recipe parameters on selected product attributes of extruded products (colour, viscosity, acrylamide, and the flavour marker 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, HDMF). The study has shown that recipe parameters (lysine, phosphate) can be used to modulate the HDMF level without changing the specific mechanical energy (SME) and consequently the texture of the product, while processing parameters (temperature, moisture) impact both HDMF and SME in parallel. Similarly, several parameters, including phosphate level, temperature and moisture, simultaneously impact both HDMF and acrylamide formation, while pH and addition of lysine showed different trends. Therefore, the latter two options can be used to mitigate acrylamide without a negative impact on flavour. Such a holistic approach has been shown as a powerful tool to optimize various product attributes upon food processing.

23940254	The ureide-degrading reactions of purine ring catabolism employ three amidohydrolases and one aminohydrolase in Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Several ureides are intermediates of purine base catabolism, releasing nitrogen from the purine nucleotides for reassimilation into amino acids. In some legumes like soybean (Glycine max), ureides are used for nodule-to-shoot translocation of fixed nitrogen. Four enzymes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), (1) allantoinase, (2) allantoate amidohydrolase (AAH), (3) ureidoglycine aminohydrolase, and (4) ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (UAH), catalyze the complete hydrolysis of the ureide allantoin in vitro. However, the metabolic route in vivo remains controversial. Here, in growth and metabolite analyses of Arabidopsis mutants, we demonstrate that these enzymes are required for allantoin degradation in vivo. Orthologous enzymes are present in soybean, encoded by one to four gene copies. All isoenzymes are active in vitro, while some may be inefficiently translated in vivo. Surprisingly, transcript and protein amounts are not significantly regulated by nitrogen fixation or leaf ureide content. A requirement for soybean AAH and UAH for ureide catabolism in leaves has been demonstrated by the use of virus-induced gene silencing. Functional AAH, ureidoglycine aminohydrolase, and UAH are also present in rice (Oryza sativa), and orthologous genes occur in all other plant genomes sequenced to date, indicating that the amidohydrolase route of ureide degradation is universal in plants, including mosses (e.g. Physcomitrella patens) and algae (e.g. Chlamydomomas reinhardtii).
23710454	Lovastatin in Aspergillus terreus: fermented rice straw extracts interferes with methane production and gene expression in Methanobrevibacter smithii.	2013	Biomed Res Int	Lovastatin, a natural byproduct of some fungi, is able to inhibit HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl CoA) reductase. This is a key enzyme involved in isoprenoid synthesis and essential for cell membrane formation in methanogenic Archaea. In this paper, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that lovastatin secreted by Aspergillus terreus in fermented rice straw extracts (FRSE) can inhibit growth and CH4 production in Methanobrevibacter smithii (a test methanogen). By HPLC analysis, 75% of the total lovastatin in FRSE was in the active hydroxyacid form, and in vitro studies confirmed that this had a stronger effect in reducing both growth and CH4 production in M. smithii compared to commercial lovastatin. Transmission electron micrographs revealed distorted morphological divisions of lovastatin- and FRSE-treated M. smithii cells, supporting its role in blocking normal cell membrane synthesis. Real-time PCR confirmed that both commercial lovastatin and FRSE increased (P < 0.01) the expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene (hmg). In addition, expressions of other gene transcripts in M. smithii. with a key involvement in methanogenesis were also affected. Experimental confirmation that CH4 production is inhibited by lovastatin in A. terreus-fermented rice straw paves the way for its evaluation as a feed additive for mitigating CH4 production in ruminants.
24498832	Natural herbicide resistance (HR) to broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate among traditional and inbred-cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in Sri Lanka.	2013	Pak J Biol Sci	Weeds along with insect pests and plant diseases are sources of biotic stress in crop systems. Weeds are responsible for serious problems in rice worldwide affecting growth and causing a considerable reduction in quality and quantity in yield. High concentrations of pre-emergent-broad-spectrum systemic herbicide, Glyphosate is prevalently applied to control rice weeds which intern causes severe damages to cultivated rice varieties, susceptible to Glyphosate. However, there may be rice varieties with natural Herbicide Resistance (HR) which are so far, has not been evaluated. In this study Six traditional and eighteen developed-cultivated rice varieties (Bg, Bw, At and Ld series developed by Rice Research Development Institute, Sri Lanka) were used to screen their natural HR. RCBD with five replicates and three blocks in each treatment-combination was used as the experimental design. As observations, time taken-to seed germination, time taken to flowering; plant height and number of leaves at 12-weeks after sawing, leaf-length, breadth, panicle-length, number of seeds/panicle of resistant plants and controls were recorded. Plants with > or = 40% resistance were considered as resistant to Glyphosate. Ten inbred-cultivated rice varieties (Bg250, Bg94-1, Bg304, Bg359, Bg406, Bg379-2, Bg366, Bg300, Bw364, At362) and three traditional rice varieties ("Kalu Heenati", "Sudu Heenati", "Pachchaperumal") were naturally resistant to 0.25 g L(-1) Glyphosate concentration and when increased the concentration (0.5 g L(-1)) resistance was reduced. This study showed the usefulness of modern statistical method, classification and regression tree analysis (CART) in exploring and visualizing the patterns reflected by a large number of rice varieties (larger experimental database) on herbicide resistance in future.
23564956	Global analysis of the sugarcane microtranscriptome reveals a unique composition of small RNAs associated with axillary bud outgrowth.	2013	J Exp Bot	Axillary bud outgrowth determines shoot architecture and is under the control of endogenous hormones and a fine-tuned gene-expression network, which probably includes small RNAs (sRNAs). Although it is well known that sRNAs act broadly in plant development, our understanding about their roles in vegetative bud outgrowth remains limited. Moreover, the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets within axillary buds are largely unknown. Here, we employed sRNA next-generation sequencing as well as computational and gene-expression analysis to identify and quantify sRNAs and their targets in vegetative axillary buds of the biofuel crop sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). Computational analysis allowed the identification of 26 conserved miRNA families and two putative novel miRNAs, as well as a number of trans-acting small interfering RNAs. sRNAs associated with transposable elements and protein-encoding genes were similarly represented in both inactive and developing bud libraries. Conversely, sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR results revealed that specific miRNAs were differentially expressed in developing buds, and some correlated negatively with the expression of their targets at specific stages of axillary bud development. For instance, the expression patterns of miR159 and its target GAMYB suggested that they may play roles in regulating abscisic acid-signalling pathways during sugarcane bud outgrowth. Our work reveals, for the first time, differences in the composition and expression profiles of diverse sRNAs and targets between inactive and developing vegetative buds that, together with the endogenous balance of specific hormones, may be important in regulating axillary bud outgrowth.
24349120	Global expression profiling of low temperature induced genes in the chilling tolerant japonica rice Jumli Marshi.	2013	PLoS One	Low temperature is a key factor that limits growth and productivity of many important agronomical crops worldwide. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is negatively affected already at temperatures below +10°C and is therefore denoted as chilling sensitive. However, chilling tolerant rice cultivars exist and can be commercially cultivated at altitudes up to 3,050 meters with temperatures reaching as low as +4°C. In this work, the global transcriptional response to cold stress (+4°C) was studied in the Nepalese highland variety Jumli Marshi (spp. japonica) and 4,636 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed within 24 hours of cold stress. Comparison with previously published microarray data from one chilling tolerant and two sensitive rice cultivars identified 182 genes differentially expressed (DE) upon cold stress in all four rice cultivars and 511 genes DE only in the chilling tolerant rice. Promoter analysis of the 182 genes suggests a complex cross-talk between ABRE and CBF regulons. Promoter analysis of the 511 genes identified over-represented ABRE motifs but not DRE motifs, suggesting a role for ABA signaling in cold tolerance. Moreover, 2,101 genes were DE in Jumli Marshi alone. By chromosomal localization analysis, 473 of these cold responsive genes were located within 13 different QTLs previously identified as cold associated.
23918431	Reverse genetics in rice using Tos17.	2013	Methods Mol Biol	Transposon of Oryza sativa 17 (Tos17), a Ty1-Copia Class I retroelement, is one of the few active retroelements identified in rice, the main cereal crop of human consumption and the model genome for cereals. Tos17 exists in two copies in the standard Nipponbare japonica genome (n = 12 and 379 Mb). Tos17 copies are inactive in the plant grown under normal conditions. However, the copy located on chromosome 7 can be activated upon tissue culture. Plants regenerated from 3- and 5-month-old tissue cultures harbor, respectively, an average of 3.5 and 8 newly transposed copies that are stably inserted at new positions in the genome. Due to its favorable features, Tos17 has been extensively used for insertion mutagenesis of the model genome and 31,403 sequence indexed inserts harbored by regenerants/T-DNA plants are available in the databases. The corresponding seed stocks can be ordered from the laboratories which generated them. Both forward genetics and reverse genetics approaches using these lines have allowed the deciphering of gene function in rice. We report here two protocols for ascertaining the presence of a Tos17 insertion in a gene of interest among R2/T2 seeds received from Tos17 mutant stock centers: The first protocol is PCR-based and allows the identification of azygous, heterozygous and homozygous plants among progenies segregating the insertion. The second protocol is based on DNA blot analysis and can be used to identify homozygous plants carrying the Tos17 copy responsible for gene disruption while cleaning the mutant background from other unwitting mutagen inserts.
22869288	Comparison of Agrobacterium and particle bombardment using whole plasmid or minimal cassette for production of high-expressing, low-copy transgenic plants.	2013	Transgenic Res	Transgene integration complexity in the recipient genome can be an important determinant of transgene expression and field performance in transgenic crops. We provide the first direct comparison of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) and particle bombardment using whole plasmid (WP) and excised minimal cassettes (MC), for transformation efficiency, transgene integration complexity and transgene expression in plants. To enable direct comparison, a selectable marker and a luciferase reporter gene were linked in identical configurations in plasmids suitable for AMT or direct gene transfer into sugarcane. Transformation efficiencies were similar between WP and MC when equal molar DNA quantities were delivered. When the MC concentration was reduced from 66 to 6.6 ng per shot, transformation efficiency dropped fourfold, to a level equivalent with AMT in amenable genotype Q117. The highest proportion of transformants combining low copy number (estimated below two integrated copies by qPCR) with expression of the non-selected reporter gene was obtained using AMT (55 %) or MC at low DNA concentration (30 %). In sugarcane, both of these methods yielded high-expressing, single-copy transgenic plant lines at a workable efficiency for practical plant improvement; but AMT is currently limited to a few amenable genotypes. These methods are best coupled with rapid early screens for desired molecular characteristics of transformants, e.g. PCR screens for low copy number and/or transcription of the gene of practical interest.
24506038	Genetic evaluation of recombinant inbred lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.) for grain zinc concentrations, yield related traits and identification of associated SSR markers.	2013	Pak J Biol Sci	The objectives of the present study were to evaluate genetic variability parameters, correlations that exist for grain Zn concentration and yield related traits and identification of SSR markers linked to these traits in rice. One hundred seventy six Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) of Azucena X Moromutant were grown at University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore in augmented experimental design during wet seasons of 2010 and 2011. The study revealed significant genetic variability for all the traits. Grain yield per plant and grain zinc concentration showed higher phenotypic and genotypic co-efficient of variation. Significant positive correlation was observed for grain yield per plant with number of productive tillers per plant (r = 0.5) and number of tillers per plant (r = 0.4). Grain zinc concentration showed negative correlation with grain yield per plant (r = - 0.27). The path-coefficient analysis indicated the positive direct effect of number of productive tillers per plant on grain yield per plant (0.514). Grain zinc concentration showed negative direct effect on grain yield per plant (-0.186). Single-marker analysis using 26 SSR markers on RILs mapping population showed that RM212, RM263, RM6832, RM152, RM21, RM234 and RM3331 had association with grain zinc concentration and other yield related traits. But validation of these markers on fifty two rice genotypes showed that only three markers RM263, RM152 and RM21 had association with grain zinc concentration. Therefore, the genetic information generated and molecular markers identified from this study could be used for zinc biofortification programmes in rice.
23054487	Tricin 4'-O-(erythro-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether and tricin 4'-O-(threo-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether isolated from Njavara (Oryza sativa L. var. Njavara), induce apoptosis in multiple tumor cells by mitochondrial pathway.	2013	J Nat Med	Njavara is an important medicinal rice variety of Kerala, India widely used in Ayurveda for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases and in rejuvenation therapy. The study evaluated, for the first time, antitumor effects of the two rare flavonolignans, tricin 4'-O-(erythro-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether (compound 1) and tricin 4'-O-(threo-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether (compound 2), isolated from 'Njavara' black. Both the compounds induced apoptosis in three cancer cell lines colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT 116, ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 and breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Chromatin condensation in the three cancer cell lines by Hoechst staining showed >50 % of apoptosis by compounds 1 and 2 at concentration 40 and 30 μg/ml, respectively after 48 h. Further studies substantiated that both the compounds targeted cancer cells through mitochondrial membrane potential loss and subsequent chromatin condensation. Both compounds significantly increased the Annexin V binding thus confirming compounds 1 and 2 to be potential apoptotic agents.
24431506	Epigenetic responses to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Cytosine methylation polymorphism plays a key role in gene regulation, mainly in expression of genes in crop plants. The differential expression of cytosine methylation over drought stress response was analyzed in rice using drought susceptible but agronomically superior lines IR 20 and CO 43, and drought tolerant genotypes PL and PMK 3 and their F1 hybrids. The parents and hybrids were subjected to two moisture regimes viz., one under drought condition and another under control condition. The cytosine methylation polymorphism in genomic DNA was quantified under both the conditions at the reproductive stage of the plant using the Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique devised by Xiong et al. (261:439-446, 1999). The results depicted that under drought condition, hyper-methylation was predominant in the drought susceptible genotypes while drought tolerant genotypes presented hypo-methylation behavior. While imposing drought, spikelet sterility per cent was positively correlated to percentage of methylation whereas, panicle length, number of seed per panicle, panicle weight, 100 seed weight, and yield/plant were negatively correlated indicating the role of epigenetic regulation in yield attributing traits in response to drought. Thus, methylation can be considered as an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism in rice plants to adapt drought situation. From this study, we speculate that the hyper- methylation may be an indicator of drought susceptibility and the hypo-methylation for drought tolerance and this methylation polymorphism can be effectively used in drought screening program.
23829075	Study on regulation of growth and biosynthesis of cellulolytic enzymes from newly isolated Aspergillus fumigatus ABK9.	2013	Pol J Microbiol	This study was aimed to evaluate the pattern of cellulase biosynthesis from Aspergillusfumigatus ABK9 under submerged fermentation. Production was increased concomitantly with fungal growth up to 72 h and reached maximum (Xmax -6.72 g/l) with specific growth rate (mu max) of 0.126/h. Highest specific rate of enzyme production (q ) was found at initial medium pH of 5.0 and incubation temperature of 30 degrees C. At the same time, in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, the production of cellulolytic enzymes, viz, carboxymethyl cellulase activity (CMCase), filter paper degrading activity (FPase) and P-glucosidase activity reached maximum of 132.2, 21.3 and 28.9 U/ml, respectively. Cellulase biosynthesis was induced in respect to higher volumetric production rate (Qp), specific rate of enzymes production (qp, U/g biomass/h) and enzyme/biomass yield (YE/X) when grown in carboxymethyl cellulose in comparison to other saccharides as sole carbon source. Induction ratios (IR) of cellulases were between 12.3 and 24.4 in the presence of 1.5% (w/v) CMC in the culture media. The strain was quite resistant to catabolic repression by glucose up to 0.4% (w/v). Cellulases production was greatly influenced in the presence of yeast extract and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2POA) as nitrogen and phosphate sources in the culture media. C/N ratio of 10.0 and C/P ratio of 4.0 proved to be the best for the production of enzyme cocktail. Along with the high production yield, the crude enzymes showed a promising cellulose hydrolyzing efficiency of rice straw, indicating the enzyme could be beneficial for its large scale industrial exploitation.
23110463	Transient induction of melatonin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) during the reproductive stage.	2013	J Pineal Res	The regulation of reproduction-stage inducible melatonin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Dongjin) was investigated. The flag leaf and panicle (flower) were collected from field-grown rice at three different reproductive stages: the preflowering stage, flowering stage, and postflowering stage. Melatonin synthesis was induced in the panicle, whereas no induction was observed in the flag leaf during the reproductive stages. The panicle displayed a peak melatonin level of 0.4 ng/g fresh weight (fw), which was six times that found in the flag leaf. The induction of melatonin biosynthesis was paralleled by the induction of corresponding genes and proteins such as tryptophan decarboxylase, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase, and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase. In addition, melatonin induction was preceded by the accumulation of its precursor, tryptophan, in the panicle. These results suggest that the induction of melatonin during flower development is regulated by the transcriptional control of its biosynthesis genes and that melatonin may participate in flower development.
24385365	Evaluation of bakanae disease progression caused by Fusarium fujikuroi in Oryza sativa L.	2013	J Microbiol	Bakanae disease caused by Fusarium fujikuroi is an important fungal disease in rice. Among the seven strains isolated from symptomatic rice grains in this study, one strain, FfB14, triggered severe root growth inhibition and decay in the crown and root of rice seedlings. The remaining six strains caused typical Bakanae symptoms such as etiolation and abnormal succulent rice growth. To reveal the relationship between mycelial growth in the infected tissues and Bakanae disease progression, we have established a reliable quantification method using real time PCR that employs a primer pair and dual-labeled probe specific to a unigene encoding F. fujikuroi PNG1 (FfPNG1), which is located upstream of the fumonisin biosynthesis gene cluster. Plotting the crossing point (CP) values from the infected tissue DNAs on a standard curve revealed the active fungal growth of FfB14 in the root and crown of rice seedlings, while the growth rate of FfB20 in rice was more than 4 times lower than FfB14. Massive infective mycelial growth of FfB14 was evident in rice stems and crown; however, FfB20 did not exhibit vigorous growth. Our quantitative evaluation system is applicable for the identification of fungal virulence factors other than gibberellin.
23833164	Cross-species analysis of genic GC3 content and DNA methylation patterns.	2013	Genome Biol Evol	The GC content in the third codon position (GC(3)) exhibits a unimodal distribution in many plant and animal genomes. Interestingly, grasses and homeotherm vertebrates exhibit a unique bimodal distribution. High GC(3) was previously found to be associated with variable expression, higher frequency of upstream TATA boxes, and an increase of GC(3) from 5' to 3'. Moreover, GC(3)-rich genes are predominant in certain gene classes and are enriched in CpG dinucleotides that are potential targets for methylation. Based on the GC(3) bimodal distribution we hypothesize that GC(3) has a regulatory role involving methylation and gene expression. To test that hypothesis, we selected diverse taxa (rice, thale cress, bee, and human) that varied in the modality of their GC(3) distribution and tested the association between GC(3), DNA methylation, and gene expression. We examine the relationship between cytosine methylation levels and GC(3), gene expression, genome signature, gene length, and other gene compositional features. We find a strong negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = -0.67, P value < 0.0001) between GC(3) and genic CpG methylation. The comparison between 5'-3' gradients of CG(3)-skew and genic methylation for the taxa in the study suggests interplay between gene-body methylation and transcription-coupled cytosine deamination effect. Compositional features are correlated with methylation levels of genes in rice, thale cress, human, bee, and fruit fly (which acts as an unmethylated control). These patterns allow us to generate evolutionary hypotheses about the relationships between GC(3) and methylation and how these affect expression patterns. Specifically, we propose that the opposite effects of methylation and compositional gradients along coding regions of GC(3)-poor and GC(3)-rich genes are the products of several competing processes.
24280345	A genome scale metabolic network for rice and accompanying analysis of tryptophan, auxin and serotonin biosynthesis regulation under biotic stress.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Functional annotations of large plant genome projects mostly provide information on gene function and gene families based on the presence of protein domains and gene homology, but not necessarily in association with gene expression or metabolic and regulatory networks. These additional annotations are necessary to understand the physiology, development and adaptation of a plant and its interaction with the environment.

RESULTS: RiceCyc is a metabolic pathway networks database for rice. It is a snapshot of the substrates, metabolites, enzymes, reactions and pathways of primary and intermediary metabolism in rice. RiceCyc version 3.3 features 316 pathways and 6,643 peptide-coding genes mapped to 2,103 enzyme-catalyzed and 87 protein-mediated transport reactions. The initial functional annotations of rice genes with InterPro, Gene Ontology, MetaCyc, and Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were enriched with annotations provided by KEGG and Gramene databases. The pathway inferences and the network diagrams were first predicted based on MetaCyc reference networks and plant pathways from the Plant Metabolic Network, using the Pathologic module of Pathway Tools. This was enriched by manually adding metabolic pathways and gene functions specifically reported for rice. The RiceCyc database is hierarchically browsable from pathway diagrams to the associated genes, metabolites and chemical structures. Through the integrated tool OMICs Viewer, users can upload transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data to visualize expression patterns in a virtual cell. RiceCyc, along with additional species-specific pathway databases hosted in the Gramene project, facilitates comparative pathway analysis.

CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe the RiceCyc network development and discuss its contribution to rice genome annotations. As a case study to demonstrate the use of RiceCyc network as a discovery environment we carried out an integrated bioinformatic analysis of rice metabolic genes that are differentially regulated under diurnal photoperiod and biotic stress treatments. The analysis of publicly available rice transcriptome datasets led to the hypothesis that the complete tryptophan biosynthesis and its dependent metabolic pathways including serotonin biosynthesis are induced by taxonomically diverse pathogens while also being under diurnal regulation. The RiceCyc database is available online for free access at http://www.gramene.org/pathway/.
24376625	OsDREB2A, a rice transcription factor, significantly affects salt tolerance in transgenic soybean.	2013	PLoS One	The dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) transcription factors play an important role in regulating stress-related genes. OsDREB2A, a member of the DREBP subfamily of AP2/ERF transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa), is involved in the abiotic stress response. OsDREB2A expression is induced by drought, low-temperature and salt stresses. Here, we report the ability of OsDREB2A to regulate high-salt response in transgenic soybean. Overexpressing OsDREB2A in soybeans enhanced salt tolerance by accumulating osmolytes, such as soluble sugars and free proline, and improving the expression levels of some stress-responsive transcription factors and key genes. The phenotypic characterization of transgenic soybean were significantly better than those of wild-type (WT). Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the OsDREB2A can bind to the DRE core element in vitro. These results indicate that OsDREB2A may participate in abiotic stress by directly binding with DRE element to regulate the expression of downstream genes. Overexpression of OsDREB2A in soybean might be used to improve tolerance to salt stress.
23661451	DNA methylation involved in proline accumulation in response to osmotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Genet Mol Res	Proline accumulation is involved in plant osmotic stress tolerance. Given that DNA methylation is related to almost all metabolic processes through regulation of gene expression, we suspected that this epigenetic modification and proline biosynthesis are probably related. To test this, we investigated whether osmotic stress-induced proline accumulation is associated with DNA methylation modifications in rice. We assessed DNA methylation and expression of 3 key genes (P5CR, P5CS, and δ-OAT) involved in proline biosynthesis, and measured proline content under both osmotic stress (15% polyethylene glycol) and control conditions. After osmotic stress, selfed progenies of osmotic-stressed plants accumulated higher concentrations of proline in leaves under both normal conditions and under osmotic stress than the unstressed control plants. Concomitantly, under osmotic stress, the selfed progeny plants showed higher expression levels of P5CS and δ-OAT than the control. This up-regulated expression was stably inherited by the subsequent generation. Methylation-sensitive Southern blotting indicated that 2 of the 3 genes, P5CS and δ-OAT, had greater DNA demethylation in the selfed progenies than in the control. Apparently DNA demethylation facilitated proline accumulation by up-regulating expression of the P5CS and δ-OAT genes in response to osmotic stress.
23697167	[Optimized condition for protoplast isolation from maize, wheat and rice leaves].	2013	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	Maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) are three staple crops and accordingly it is very meaningful to optimize the condition of their protoplasts isolation. The concentration of the enzyme, the time of isolation and centrifugal force in protoplast isolation were investigated to find their effects on protoplast yield and viability using leaves of maize (Zong 3), wheat (Chinese Spring) and rice (Nipponbare). The results show that the concentration of the enzyme and the time of isolation affected the protoplast yield significantly. Although the yield of protoplast was increased with high concentration of enzyme and long incubated time, it led to too much cells breakdown. The orthogonal experimental design results show that the best condition of maize protoplast isolation was Cellulase R-10 1.5%, Macerozyme R-10 0.5%, 50 r/min 7 h, 100 x g 2 min and the protoplasts yield was 7x106 cells/g fresh weight (FW); the best condition of wheat protoplast isolation was Cellulase R-10 1.5%, Macerozyme R-10 0.5%, 50 r/min 5 h, 100 x g 2 min and the protoplasts yield was 6 x 10(6) cells/g FW; the best condition of rice protoplast isolation was Cellulase R-10 2.0%, Macerozyme R-10 0.7%, 50 r/min 7 h, 1 000 x g 2 min and the protoplasts yield was 6x10(6) cells/g FW. The vitalities were more than 90% using fluorescein diacetate staining method. 50%-80% transformation efficiency was obtained when protoplasts were transformed by green fluorescent protein using PEG-Ca2+ method.
24301915	Overexpression of an alternative oxidase gene, OsAOX1a, improves cold tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Low temperature is a major environmental stress in rice cultivating and production. The alternative oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene is potentially important for genetic engineering to increase cold adaptation. However, previous studies related to this effect have mostly focused on the dicot plants Arabidopsis and tobacco, whereas functional research on rice is limited. In this study, we cloned a rice predominant cold-response AOX1 gene, OsAOX1a. Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsAOX1a were obtained. We found that OsAOX1a overexpression could strongly enhance the cold growth of seedlings, especially with respect to root extension. However, growth between transgenic and control plants did not differ under normal conditions. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation and ion leakage rate were determined after cold treatment in transgenic plants. Both factors were reduced by OsAOX1a overexpression, which revealed that OsAOX1a could reduce oxidative damage under cold stress. Taken together, our results suggested that overexpressing OsAOX1a could improve growth performance of rice under cold stress, which might be closely related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage.
23819293	Effects of cadmium on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative defences of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Int J Phytoremediation	The effects of 60-d cadmium (Cd) exposure on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative system of Oryza sativa L. seedlings at tillering stage were studied using soil culture experiment. Research findings showed that chlorophyll content of Oryza sativa L. declined with the increase in soil metal concentration. Cd pollution induced the antioxidant stress by inducing O2(-1) and H2O2, which increased in plants; at the same time, MDA as the final product of peroxidation of membrane lipids, accumulated in plant. The antioxidant enzyme system was initiated under the Cd exposure, i.e. almost all the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase were elevated both in leaves and roots. The non-protein thiols including phytochelatins and glutathione to scavenge toxic free radicals caused by Cd stress was also studied. The contents of phytochelatins and glutathione were about 3.12-6.65-fold and 3.27-10.73-fold in leaves, against control; and the corresponding values were about 3.53-9.37-fold and 1.41-5.11-fold in roots, accordingly.
23436553	Determination of endogenous brassinosteroids in plant tissues using solid-phase extraction with double layered cartridge followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.	None	Phytochem Anal	INTRODUCTION: Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of important phytohormones that play vital roles in plant growth, development and a series of physiological phenomena. In order to understand biosynthesis, degradation and metabolic pathways of BRs, a reliable analytical method of BRs with effective sample pre-treatment process is favourable.

OBJECTIVE: The development of a quick and effective method for the quantification of endogenous BRs in plant tissue with the aid of double layered solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (graphite carbon black and primary secondary amine silica sorbent: GCB/PSA).

METHOD: The method involved an initial extraction of BRs with acetonitrile, a dehydration process with anhydrous MgSO4 and NaCl, a SPE purification process with a double layered cartridge, and a further clean-up step utilising liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). The purification process was mainly realised on the GCB/PSA cartridge. GCB could eliminate hydrophobic compounds, especially those containing a π system, and PSA was introduced to remove the polar interferences. Endogenous BRs were quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.

RESULTS: Good linearities were obtained in the range of 0.4-500 ng/mL (0.0124-15 ng), with the correlation coefficients above 0.9957. The relative recoveries of BRs of this method were in the range of 71.1-113.1%, with intra- and interday relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 16.3%. With the proposed method, the requirement of plant tissue amount was minimised to 1 g fresh weight, which is the smallest amount reported so far, to our knowledge.
24391034	Molecular cloning and expression of drought-induced protein 3 (DIP3) encoding a class III chitinase in upland rice.	2013	Genet Mol Res	A drought-induced gene, DIP3, encoding a chitinase III protein was isolated from the roots of upland rice by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis demonstrated that the cDNA and deduced protein showed high identity to Oryza sativa class III chitinase. The deduced protein contained a signal peptide sequence in the N-terminal region of 21aa and a conserved glycosyl hydrolase (GH) 18 domain. The secondary and 3D structures were analyzed and showed that it contained α-helix, β-sheets, extended strand and random coil structures and that it was approximately spheroidal. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression levels accumulated rapidly under different forms of abiotic stress (drought, salt and low temperature), peaked at different times and then decreased. These results implied that as a member of class III chitinases, DIP3 may function as a stress-induced protein involved in the regulation of plant stress response.
24301783	Development of 1047 insertion-deletion markers for rice genetic studies and breeding.	2013	Genet Mol Res	In this study, a total of 1047 insertion-deletion (InDel) primer pairs distributed across the rice genome were developed and experimentally validated. The primer pairs were designed based on the InDel length polymorphisms between 93-11 (Oryza sativa ssp indica cv.) and Nipponbare (Oryza sativa ssp japonica cv.), aiming for utilization between indica and japonica rice, or between other inter-subspecific rice cultivars. The 1047 primer pairs were dispersed across all 12 of the rice chromosomes, with one InDel marker found every 371.3 kb on average. The InDel length of the markers varied from 3 to 39 bp: 88.2% of the markers contained 6 to 25 bp, only 6.2% of markers were ≤ 5 bp, and 5.6% were ≥ 26 bp. Six hundred and twenty-three (59.5%) of the 1047 InDel markers were shown to amplify well and were polymorphic between Taichung65 and IR8, and 476 (45.5%) markers were polymorphic between Lemont and Yangdao4, while 398 (38.0%) were polymorphic in both combinations. These results demonstrated that the polymerase chain reaction-based InDel markers developed in this study could be of immediate use for rice genetic studies and breeding programs.
24341590	A BAC based physical map and genome survey of the rice false smut fungus Villosiclava virens.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice false smut caused by Villosiclava virens is a devastating fungal disease that spreads in major rice-growing regions throughout the world. However, the genomic information for this fungal pathogen is limited and the pathogenic mechanism of this disease is still not clear. To facilitate genetic, molecular and genomic studies of this fungal pathogen, we constructed the first BAC-based physical map and performed the first genome survey for this species.

RESULTS: High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from young mycelia of the Villosiclava virens strain UV-8b and a high-quality, large-insert and deep-coverage Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library was constructed with the restriction enzyme HindIII. The BAC library consisted of 5,760 clones, which covers 22.7-fold of the UV-8b genome, with an average insert size of 140 kb and an empty clone rate of lower than 1%. BAC fingerprinting generated successful fingerprints for 2,290 BAC clones. Using the fingerprints, a whole genome-wide BAC physical map was constructed that contained 194 contigs (2,035 clones) spanning 51.2 Mb in physical length. Bidirectional-end sequencing of 4,512 BAC clones generated 6,560 high quality BAC end sequences (BESs), with a total length of 3,030,658 bp, representing 8.54% of the genome sequence. Analysis of the BESs revealed general genome information, including 51.52% GC content, 22.51% repetitive sequences, 376.12/Mb simple sequence repeat (SSR) density and approximately 36.01% coding regions. Sequence comparisons to other available fungal genome sequences through BESs showed high similarities to Metarhizium anisopliae, Trichoderma reesei, Nectria haematococca and Cordyceps militaris, which were generally in agreement with the 18S rRNA gene analysis results.

CONCLUSION: This study provides the first BAC-based physical map and genome information for the important rice fungal pathogen Villosiclava virens. The BAC clones, physical map and genome information will serve as fundamental resources to accelerate the genetic, molecular and genomic studies of this pathogen, including positional cloning, comparative genomic analysis and whole genome sequencing. The BAC library and physical map have been opened to researchers as public genomic resources (http://gresource.hzau.edu.cn/resource/resource.html).

23659171	Cell death of rice roots under salt stress may be mediated by cyanide-resistant respiration.	None	Z Naturforsch C	Treatment with solutions containing high concentrations of NaCl (200 or 300 mM) induced cell death in rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots, as well as the application of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Moreover, the pretreatment with dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a scavenger of H2O2, partially alleviated the root cell death induced by 200 mM NaCl. These observations suggest that the cell death of rice roots under high salt stress is linked to H2O2 accumulation in vivo. NaCl stress increased the level of cyanide-resistant respiration to some extent and enhanced the transcript levels of the alternative oxidase (AOX) genes AOX1a and AOX1b in rice roots. High-salt-stressed (200 mM NaCl) rice roots pretreated with 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), a specific inhibitor of alternative oxidase, exhibited higher levels of cell death and H2O2 production than roots subjected to either 200 mM NaCl stress or SHAM treatment alone. These results suggest that cyanide-resistant respiration could play a role in mediating root cell death under high salt stress. Furthermore, this function of cyanide-resistant respiration could relate to its ability to reduce the generation of H2O2.
24280625	Roles of plant growth regulators on yield, grain qualities and antioxidant enzyme activities in super hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Plant growth regulators play important roles in plant growth and development, but little is known about roles of plant growth regulators in yield, grain qualities and antioxidant enzyme activities in super hybrid rice. In this study, gibberellic acid(GA3), paclobutrazol (PBZ), 6-Benzylaminopurine(6-BA) treatments and distilled water (control) were sprayed to two hybrid rice cultivars (Peizataifeng and Huayou 86) at the heading stage in the field experiments in both early and late season in 2007. Treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. Cultivars treatments with two newly developed super hybrid rice Peizataifeng and Huayou86 were the main plots and plant growth regulators treatments were the subplots. Subplot treatments included (1) plots sprayed with distilled water(CK), (2) plots sprayed with 20 mg L-1 GA3 prepared using 95% ethanol as surfactant(GA3), (3) plots sprayed with 50 mg L-1 PBZ(PBZ), (4) plots sprayed with 30 mg L-1 6-BA(6-BA).

RESULTS: Spraying PBZ with 50 mg L-1 or 6-BA with 30 mg L-1 at the heading stage could increase the number of spikelets per panicle, seed setting rate and grain yields in Peizataifeng and Huayou86 in both seasons. PBZ treatment also significantly improved head rice rate and amylose content in Peizataifeng and Huayou86 in early season. Furthermore, it was observed that spraying PBZ or 6-BA could increase super oxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, decrease accumulation of malendialdehyde (MDA) in flag leaves at the late growth stage.

CONCLUSIONS: Application of PBZ or 6-BA partially alleviated the detrimental effects of rice senescence by modulating the activity of enzymatic antioxidants, and improving antioxidant system, which helped in sustaining plant growth. Therefore, spraying PBZ with 50 mg L-1 or 6-BA with 30 mg L-1 at the heading stage could increase grain yields and improve grain qualities in the two super hybrid rice.
24065663	Identification of a new locus conferring antixenosis to the brown planthopper in rice cultivar Swarnalata (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Genet Mol Res	The brown planthopper [Nilaparvata lugens (Stål); BPH] has caused severe damage to rice production. The identification of resistance genes and the development of BPH-resistant varieties are economical and effective ways to manage this pest. Using an F2 population from a cross between the Indica cultivars 93-11 and Swarnalata, we mapped the Qbph-8 locus to a 7.3-cM region on chromosome 8 in two tests, flanked by the markers RM339 and RM515. In this population, Qbph-8 explained 7.7 and 6.6% of the phenotypic variance of BPH preference in both tests. In the BPH host choice test, the average number of settled BPHs on the Qbph-8 plants was less than that on the 93-11 plants over the 24- to 120-h observation period. Furthermore, less BPH insects were observed on the BPH6+Qbph-8 plant compared with the BPH6 plant or Qbph-8 plant, indicating a stronger antixenotic effect shown in the gene pyramiding plants. Hence, this locus can be pyramided with other BPH resistance genes and applied to breed-resistant varieties, which possibly can improve the resistance level and durable resistance to the BPH.
24386120	Identification and functional analysis of flowering related microRNAs in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is a class of non-coding RNAs involved in post- transcriptional control of gene expression, via degradation and/or translational inhibition. Six-hundred sixty-one rice miRNAs are known that are important in plant development. However, flowering-related miRNAs have not been characterized in Oryza rufipogon Griff. It was approved by supervision department of Guangdong wild rice protection. We analyzed flowering-related miRNAs in O. rufipogon using high-throughput sequencing (deep sequencing) to understand the changes that occurred during rice domestication, and to elucidate their functions in flowering.

RESULTS: Three O. rufipogon sRNA libraries, two vegetative stage (CWR-V1 and CWR-V2) and one flowering stage (CWR-F2) were sequenced using Illumina deep sequencing. A total of 20,156,098, 21,531,511 and 20,995,942 high quality sRNA reads were obtained from CWR-V1, CWR-V2 and CWR-F2, respectively, of which 3,448,185, 4,265,048 and 2,833,527 reads matched known miRNAs. We identified 512 known rice miRNAs in 214 miRNA families and predicted 290 new miRNAs. Targeted functional annotation, GO and KEGG pathway analyses predicted that 187 miRNAs regulate expression of flowering-related genes. Differential expression analysis of flowering-related miRNAs showed that: expression of 95 miRNAs varied significantly between the libraries, 66 are flowering-related miRNAs, such as oru-miR97, oru-miR117, oru-miR135, oru-miR137, et al. 17 are early-flowering -related miRNAs, including osa-miR160f, osa-miR164d, osa-miR167d, osa-miR169a, osa-miR172b, oru-miR4, et al., induced during the floral transition. Real-time PCR revealed the same expression patterns as deep sequencing. miRNAs targets were confirmed for cleavage by 5'-RACE in vivo, and were negatively regulated by miRNAs.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first investigation of flowering miRNAs in wild rice. The result indicates that variation in miRNAs occurred during rice domestication and lays a foundation for further study of phase change and flowering in O. rufipogon. Complicated regulatory networks mediated by multiple miRNAs regulate the expression of flowering genes that control the induction of flowering.
24338404	Genome-wide multilocus analysis of intraspecific differentiation in Oryza rufipogon Griff. from China and the influence of introgression from O. sativa L.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Twenty-five populations of Oryza rufipogon from China and 144 cultivars of Oryza sativa were selected for this study. Based on the DNA fragment of Ehd1-4 and subspecies-specific sequence-tagged site markers in different chromosomes, intraspecific differentiation in O. rufipogon from China was analyzed. The introgression from O. sativa to O. rufipogon was also analyzed based on simple sequence repeat markers. The results revealed that the DNA fragment of Ehd1-4 could distinguish the O. sativa subspecies japonica and indica. Furthermore, although significant indica-japonica differentiation did not occur in most O. rufipogon populations from China, O. rufipogon varieties from Hainan Island and from the mainland of China showed differentiation tendencies. Japonica-like O. rufipogon varieties were predominant in Mainland China. However, more indica-like O. rufipogon varieties were found in Hainan Island. Finally, although cultivar-specific alleles were found in most of the O. rufipogon varieties from Hainan Island and Guangdong Province, some varieties remain pure and non-introgressive.
23774898	Two distinct secretion systems facilitate tissue invasion by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Nat Commun	To cause plant diseases, pathogenic micro-organisms secrete effector proteins into host tissue to suppress immunity and support pathogen growth. Bacterial pathogens have evolved several distinct secretion systems to target effector proteins, but whether fungi, which cause the major diseases of most crop species, also require different secretory mechanisms is not known. Here we report that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae possesses two distinct secretion systems to target effectors during plant infection. Cytoplasmic effectors, which are delivered into host cells, preferentially accumulate in the biotrophic interfacial complex, a novel plant membrane-rich structure associated with invasive hyphae. We show that the biotrophic interfacial complex is associated with a novel form of secretion involving exocyst components and the Sso1 t-SNARE. By contrast, effectors that are secreted from invasive hyphae into the extracellular compartment follow the conventional secretory pathway. We conclude that the blast fungus has evolved distinct secretion systems to facilitate tissue invasion.
24166434	High-throughput analysis of rice genes by means of the heterologous full-length cDNA overexpressor (FOX)-hunting system.	2013	Int J Dev Biol	Mutant populations are indispensable tools for investigating plant gene functions. Gain-of-function technology is one of the approaches used for the systematic production of mutant resources and activation tagging is a well-established method to generate gain-of-function mutants in plants. As an alternative approach for the systematic generation of a gain-of-function mutant population, we developed the Full-length cDNA OvereXpressor (FOX)-hunting system in which full-length cDNAs (fl-cDNAs) are overexpressed in plants to quickly identify candidate genes. The FOX-hunting system was used for high-throughput analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genes heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana (rice FOX Arabidopsis lines). A large screening to identify and characterize rice genes with rice FOX Arabidopsis lines revealed that one of the isolated genes, BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1) conferred multiple or broad-spectrum disease resistance in both a dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant. We found that expression of rice fl-cDNAs without a homolog in Arabidopsis affected morphological traits. In addition, overexpression of homologous genes of rice and Arabidopsis led to a similar phenotype. Thus, we conclude that the FOX-hunting system is an excellent heterologous system and offers a new tool with which to explore gene function in rice.
23683923	DOG1-like genes in cereals: investigation of their function by means of ectopic expression in Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Sci	The Arabidopsis gene DOG1 (AtDOG1) functions in seed dormancy and in sugar signaling. Little is known about the structural and functional features of plant genes homologous to AtDOG1, except for one type (clade 1) of Triticeae AtDOG1-like genes, which was previously demonstrated to be functionally orthologous to AtDOG1. Here, through phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses of cereal AtDOG1-like genes, we characterized their features: these genes exist as a gene family that can be classified into five distinct clades (1-5). Of these, AtDOG1-like genes in clades 1-4 have a similar architecture to AtDOG1: they encode proteins with three conserved regions. In contrast, the clade 5 genes are distinct; their encoded proteins lack these conserved regions, but harbor domains that interact with DNA. Ectopic expression of the cereal AtDOG1-like genes of clades 2-4 in Arabidopsis demonstrated that like the clade 1 genes, they performed the same function as AtDOG1. The correlation between the depth of seed dormancy and the efficiency of sugar signaling in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred by genes in clades 1-4 suggests a close link in the underlying mechanisms between the seed dormancy and sugar signaling functions of AtDOG1.
23830635	The role of plant Bax inhibitor-1 in suppressing H2O2-induced cell death.	2013	Methods Enzymol	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to be a typical endogenous signaling molecule that triggers programmed cell death in plants and metazoan. In this respect, they seem to share the mechanism of cell death caused by H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a well-conserved protein in plants and animals that serves as the inhibitor of mammalian proapoptotic proteins as well as plant ROS-induced cell death. As a target of H2O2, mitochondrion is considered to be an organelle of the primary ROS generation and perception. Thus, analysis of mitochondrial behavior in relation to functional roles of regulatory proteins (e.g., BI-1) will lead us to understand the core mechanisms of cell death regulation conserved in eukaryotes. In this chapter, we first introduce techniques of analyzing H2O2- (and ROS-) mediated changes in mitochondrial behavior. Next, we describe our understanding of the functions of plant BI-1 in regulation of ROS-induced cell death, with a technical basis for assessment of tolerance to ROS-mediated cell death in model plant systems.
24025801	Subfunctionalization of sigma factors during the evolution of land plants based on mutant analysis of liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha L.) MpSIG1.	2013	Genome Biol Evol	Sigma factor is a subunit of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase that regulates the transcription of plastid-encoded genes by recognizing a set of promoters. Sigma factors have increased in copy number and have diversified during the evolution of land plants, but details of this process remain unknown. Liverworts represent the basal group of embryophytes and are expected to retain the ancestral features of land plants. In liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha L.), we isolated and characterized a T-DNA-tagged mutant (Mpsig1) of sigma factor 1 (MpSIG1). The mutant did not show any visible phenotypes, implying that MpSIG1 function is redundant with that of other sigma factors. However, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA gel blot analysis revealed that genes related to photosynthesis were downregulated, resulting in the minor reduction of some protein complexes. The transcript levels of genes clustered in the petL, psaA, psbB, psbK, and psbE operons of liverwort were lower than those in the wild type, a result similar to that in the SIG1 defective mutant in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression analysis revealed primitive functional divergence between the SIG1 and SIG2 proteins in bryophytes, whereas these proteins still retain functional redundancy. We also discovered that the predominant sigma factor for ndhF mRNA expression has been diversified in liverwort, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and rice. Our study shows the ancestral function of SIG1 and the process of functional partitioning (subfunctionalization) of sigma factors during the evolution of land plants.
24399907	Genetic mechanisms of postzygotic reproductive isolation: An epistatic network in rice.	2013	Breed Sci	Products of interspecific crosses often show abnormal phenotypes such as sterility, weakness and inviability. These phenomena play an important role in speciation as mechanisms of postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI). During the past two decades, genetics studies in rice have characterized a number of gene loci responsible for postzygotic RI. I have identified 10 loci including three sets of epistatic networks in a single inter-subspecific cross (Oryza sativa ssp. indica × japonica). These results suggest that RI genes cause developmental dysfunction of vegetative and/or reproductive organs through a variety of molecular pathways. The latest molecular studies demonstrated that hybrid incompatibility is mainly due to deleterious interactions caused by species-specific mutations of two or more genes, mediated by proteins acting within the same molecular pathway. Because genetic interactions provide a perspective on gene function, epistatic networks are a key to the understanding of the molecular basis of postzygotic RI. In this review, I focus on recent progress in postzygotic RI studies in rice and discuss the evolutionary significance as well as implications for improving rice productivity.
23888867	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance.	2013	Plant J	A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine. Knockdown of this gene resulted in decreased tolerance to Al, but did not affect the tolerance to Cd. The aluminum (Al) content in the root residues including cell wall and the plasma membrane of knockdown lines decreased, but the Al concentration in the root cell sap increased compared with those of the wild-type rice. OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals. There was a small genotypic variation in OsCDT3 expression level, but no correlation between Al tolerance and the OsCDT3 variation was found among 17 rice cultivars. Analysis of pOsCDT3::GFP transgenic rice showed that OsCDT3 was expressed at all cells in the root tips. Transient expression of OsCDT3 fused with GFP at both N- and C-termini showed that OsCDT3 was anchored to the plasma membrane. Expression of OsCDT3 in yeast conferred tolerance to Al, but not to Cd. Furthermore, OsCDT3 did not show transport activity for Al in yeast, but was able to directly bind Al in vitro. Taken together, our results indicate that OsCDT3 anchoring to the plasma membrane may play a role in stopping entry of Al into the root cells by binding Al, therefore, contributing to high Al tolerance in rice.
24511713	Application of stress indices for low temperature and deep sowing stress screening of rice genotypes.	2013	Pak J Biol Sci	Low temperature or cold stress and deep sowing plays a pivotal role in limiting rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity in the temperate rice growing regions as well as in tropical high lands worldwide. A better understanding of stress tolerance mechanism in rice plants will help to develop rice germplasm with improved field level tolerance under variable temperature and sowing deep conditions. Using previously developed stress indices, this study presents results from low temperature and deep sowing screening of four rice genotypes. A group of 25 seeds per replicate (total of 3 replicates) was subjected to stress by deep sowing (15 cm) while another group was subjected to cold stress (13 degrees C-10 h/18 degrees C-14 h) and the control group remained under optimum conditions (25 degrees C and sowing depth of 1.5 cm). The Geometric Mean (GM), Stress Tolerance Index (STI) and Stress Susceptibility Index (SSI) were used to evaluate the genotypic performance under control and stress conditions. The results indicate that it was possible to identify superior genotypes for tolerance based on their stress indices. The indices although correlated, were found to be effective for the selection of genotypes with good yield potential under control and stress treatments and can now be used for genotypic screening under field conditions.
24511695	Temporal patterns and source apportionment of nitrate-nitrogen leaching in a paddy field at Kelantan, Malaysia.	2013	Pak J Biol Sci	Nitrate-nitrogen leaching from agricultural areas is a major cause for groundwater pollution. Polluted groundwater with high levels of nitrate is hazardous and cause adverse health effects. Human consumption of water with elevated levels of NO3-N has been linked to the infant disorder methemoglobinemia and also to non-Hodgkin's disease lymphoma in adults. This research aims to study the temporal patterns and source apportionment of nitrate-nitrogen leaching in a paddy soil at Ladang Merdeka Ismail Mulong in Kelantan, Malaysia. The complex data matrix (128 x 16) of nitrate-nitrogen parameters was subjected to multivariate analysis mainly Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). PCA extracted four principal components from this data set which explained 86.4% of the total variance. The most important contributors were soil physical properties confirmed using Alyuda Forecaster software (R2 = 0.98). Discriminant analysis was used to evaluate the temporal variation in soil nitrate-nitrogen on leaching process. Discriminant analysis gave four parameters (hydraulic head, evapotranspiration, rainfall and temperature) contributing more than 98% correct assignments in temporal analysis. DA allowed reduction in dimensionality of the large data set which defines the four operating parameters most efficient and economical to be monitored for temporal variations. This knowledge is important so as to protect the precious groundwater from contamination with nitrate.
24494531	Pest and disease tolerance in rice cv Pusa Basmati as related to different locally available organic manures grown in new alluvail region of West Bengal, India.	2013	Pak J Biol Sci	Field experiments were carried out to evaluate relative efficacy of organic manures in improving productivity, pest tolerance of rice in lateritic soil. Three commercial manures viz., Processed Municipality Waste (PMW), Vermicompost (VC) and Oil Cake Pellets (OCP) were assessed in relation to Farmyard Manure (FYM) and with Chemical Fertilizer (CF). Among the organic manures tested, FYM produced maximum grain yield. Maximum tolerance to pests and pathogens in terms of per cent affected hills/panicles was observed when manured with VC followed by FYM. Chemical fertilizer showed significantly higher per cent affected hills and plants compared to all other organic manures. Among the commercial manures, PMW emerged as a potential alternative to FYM and VC.
24199713	Analysis of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola population in Mali and Burkina Faso reveals a high level of genetic and pathogenic diversity.	2014	Phytopathology	Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola was first reported in Africa in the 1980s. Recently, a substantial reemergence of this disease was observed in West Africa. Samples were collected at various sites in five and three different rice-growing regions of Burkina Faso and Mali, respectively. Sixty-seven X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains were isolated from cultivated and wild rice varieties and from weeds showing BLS symptoms. X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains were evaluated for virulence on rice and showed high variation in lesion length on a susceptible cultivar. X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains were further characterized by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using six housekeeping genes. Inferred dendrograms clearly indicated different groups among X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using the transcriptional activator like effector avrXa7 as probe resulted in the identification of 18 haplotypes. Polymerase chain reaction-based analyses of two conserved type III effector (T3E) genes (xopAJ and xopW) differentiated the strains into distinct groups, with xopAJ not detected in most African X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. XopAJ functionality was confirmed by leaf infiltration on 'Kitaake' rice Rxo1 lines. Sequence analysis of xopW revealed four groups among X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. Distribution of 43 T3E genes shows variation in a subset of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. Together, our results show that African X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains are diverse and rapidly evolving, with a group endemic to Africa and another one that may have evolved from an Asian strain.
24158358	Gene editing a constitutively active OsRac1 by homologous recombination-based gene targeting induces immune responses in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	OsRac1 is a member of the plant small GTPase Rac/Rop family and plays a key role in rice immunity. The constitutively active (CA) G19V mutation of OsRac1 was previously shown to induce reactive oxygen species production, phytoalexin synthesis and defense gene activation, leading to resistance to rice blast infection. To study further the effect of the G19V mutation in disease resistance, we introduced a single base substitution by gene targeting and removed the selectable marker using Cre-loxP site-specific recombination. The CA-OsRac1 gene generated by gene targeting was termed CA-gOsRac1. The G19V mutation was transferred from a targeting vector to the OsRac1 locus and stably transmitted to the next generation. In the leaf blade of homozygous CA-gOsRac1 plants, mutant transcript levels were much lower than in those of wild-type plants. In contrast, mutant transcripts in roots, leaf sheaths and panicles were more abundant than those in leaf blades. However, upon chitin treatment, the expression of defense-related genes PAL1 and PBZ1 in the cell culture was greater in the mutants compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, induction of hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death was observed in the leaf sheaths of mutant plants infected with a compatible race of rice blast fungus. In the CA-gOsRac1 plants, a number of genes previously shown to be induced by Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection were induced in the leaf sheath without pathogen infection. These results suggest that gene targeting will provide mutations useful for gene function studies and crop improvement.
23807236	Multi-component immunochromatographic assay for simultaneous detection of aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A and zearalenone in agro-food.	2013	Biosens Bioelectron	Mycotoxins are highly toxic contaminants and have induced health threat to human and animals. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) commonly occur in food and feed. A multi-component immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed for rapid and simultaneous determination of these three mycotoxins in agro-food. The strategy was performed based on the competitive immunoreactions between antibody-colloidal gold nanoparticle conjugate probes and mycotoxins or mycotixin antigens. Each monoclonal antibody specially recognize its corresponding mycotoxin and antigen, and there was no cross reactivity in the assay. Three mycotixin antigens were immobilized as three test lines in the nitrocellulose membrane reaction zone, which enable the simultaneous detection in one single test. The visible ICA results were obtained in 20 min. The visual detection limits of this strip test for the AFB1, OTA and ZEA were 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The assay was evaluated using spiked and naturally contaminated peanuts, maize and rice samples. The results were in accordance with those obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In summary, this developed ICA could provide an effective and rapid approach for onsite detection of multi-mycotoxin in agro-food samples without any expensive instrument.
24236092	Identification of miRNAs and their target genes in peach (Prunus persica L.) using high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis.	2013	PLoS One	MicroRNAs play critical roles in various biological and metabolic processes. The function of miRNAs has been widely studied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. However, the number of identified miRNAs and related miRNA targets in peach (Prunus persica) is limited. To understand further the relationship between miRNAs and their target genes during tissue development in peach, a small RNA library and three degradome libraries were constructed from three tissues for deep sequencing. We identified 117 conserved miRNAs and 186 novel miRNA candidates in peach by deep sequencing and 19 conserved miRNAs and 13 novel miRNAs were further evaluated for their expression by RT-qPCR. The number of gene targets that were identified for 26 conserved miRNA families and 38 novel miRNA candidates, were 172 and 87, respectively. Some of the identified miRNA targets were abundantly represented as conserved miRNA targets in plant. However, some of them were first identified and showed important roles in peach development. Our study provides information concerning the regulatory network of miRNAs in peach and advances our understanding of miRNA functions during tissue development.
24265739	Genome-wide comparative in silico analysis of the RNA helicase gene family in Zea mays and Glycine max: a comparison with Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa.	2013	PLoS One	RNA helicases are enzymes that are thought to unwind double-stranded RNA molecules in an energy-dependent fashion through the hydrolysis of NTP. RNA helicases are associated with all processes involving RNA molecules, including nuclear transcription, editing, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA export, and organelle gene expression. The involvement of RNA helicase in response to stress and in plant growth and development has been reported previously. While their importance in Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa has been partially studied, the function of RNA helicase proteins is poorly understood in Zea mays and Glycine max. In this study, we identified a total of RNA helicase genes in Arabidopsis and other crop species genome by genome-wide comparative in silico analysis. We classified the RNA helicase genes into three subfamilies according to the structural features of the motif II region, such as DEAD-box, DEAH-box and DExD/H-box, and different species showed different patterns of alternative splicing. Secondly, chromosome location analysis showed that the RNA helicase protein genes were distributed across all chromosomes with different densities in the four species. Thirdly, phylogenetic tree analyses identified the relevant homologs of DEAD-box, DEAH-box and DExD/H-box RNA helicase proteins in each of the four species. Fourthly, microarray expression data showed that many of these predicted RNA helicase genes were expressed in different developmental stages and different tissues under normal growth conditions. Finally, real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of 10 genes in Arabidopsis and 13 genes in Zea mays were in close agreement with the microarray expression data. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a comparative genome-wide analysis of the RNA helicase gene family in Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Glycine max. This study provides valuable information for understanding the classification and putative functions of the RNA helicase gene family in crop growth and development.
24253199	New insights into aluminum tolerance in rice: the ASR5 protein binds the STAR1 promoter and other aluminum-responsive genes.	2014	Mol Plant	Aluminum (Al) toxicity in plants is one of the primary constraints in crop production. Al³⁺, the most toxic form of Al, is released into soil under acidic conditions and causes extensive damage to plants, especially in the roots. In rice, Al tolerance requires the ASR5 gene, but the molecular function of ASR5 has remained unknown. Here, we perform genome-wide analyses to identify ASR5-dependent Al-responsive genes in rice. Based on ASR5_RNAi silencing in plants, a global transcriptome analysis identified a total of 961 genes that were responsive to Al treatment in wild-type rice roots. Of these genes, 909 did not respond to Al in the ASR5_RNAi plants, indicating a central role for ASR5 in Al-responsive gene expression. Under normal conditions, without Al treatment, the ASR5_RNAi plants expressed 1.756 genes differentially compared to the wild-type plants, and 446 of these genes responded to Al treatment in the wild-type plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing identified 104 putative target genes that were directly regulated by ASR5 binding to their promoters, including the STAR1 gene, which encodes an ABC transporter required for Al tolerance. Motif analysis of the binding peak sequences revealed the binding motif for ASR5, which was confirmed via in vitro DNA-binding assays using the STAR1 promoter. These results demonstrate that ASR5 acts as a key transcription factor that is essential for Al-responsive gene expression and Al tolerance in rice.
24237627	Characterization of a novel DUF1618 gene family in rice.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Domain of unknown function (DUF) proteins represent a number of gene families that encode functionally uncharacterized proteins in eukaryotes. For example, DUF1618 family members in plants possess a 56-199-amino acid conserved domain and this family has not been described previously. Here, we report the characterization of 121 DUF1618 genes identified in the rice genome. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the rice DUF1618 family was divided into two major groups, each group consisting of two clades. Most DUF1618 genes with close phylogenetic relationships are located in gene clusters on the chromosomes, indicating that gene duplications increased the number of DUF1618 genes. A search for DUF1618 genes in genomic and/or expressed sequence tag databases for 35 other plant species showed that DUF1618 genes are only present in several monocot plants, suggesting that DUF1618 is a new gene family that originated after the dicot-monocot divergence. Based on public microarray databases, most rice DUF1618 genes are expressed at relatively low levels. Further experimental analysis showed that the transcriptional levels of some DUF1618 genes varied in different cultivars, and some responded to stress and hormone conditions, suggesting their important roles for development and fitness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
24209631	Over-expression of BvMTSH, a fusion gene for maltooligosyltrehalose synthase and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase, enhances drought tolerance in transgenic rice.	2014	BMB Rep	Plant abiotic stress tolerance has been modulated by engineering the trehalose synthesis pathway. However, many stress-tolerant plants that have been genetically engineered for the trehalose synthesis pathway also show abnormal development. The metabolic intermediate trehalose 6-phosphate has the potential to cause aberrations in growth. To avoid growth inhibition by trehalose 6-phosphate, we used a gene that encodes a bifunctional in-frame fusion (BvMTSH) of maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (BvMTS) and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (BvMTH) from the nonpathogenic bacterium Brevibacterium helvolum. BvMTS converts maltooligosaccharides into maltooligosyltrehalose and BvMTH releases trehalose. Transgenic rice plants that over-express BvMTSH under the control of the constitutive rice cytochrome c promoter (101MTSH) or the ABA-inducible Ai promoter (105MTSH) show enhanced drought tolerance without growth inhibition. Moreover, 101MTSH and 105MTSH showed an ABA-hyposensitive phenotype in the roots. Our results suggest that over-expression of BvMTSH enhances drought-stress tolerance without any abnormal growth and showes ABA hyposensitive phenotype in the roots.
24214894	Fifteen million years of evolution in the Oryza genus shows extensive gene family expansion.	2014	Mol Plant	In analyzing gene families in the whole-genome sequences available for O. sativa (AA), O. glaberrima (AA), and O. brachyantha (FF), we observed large size expansions in the AA genomes compared to FF genomes for the super-families F-box and NB-ARC, and five additional families: the Aspartic proteases, BTB/POZ proteins (BTB), Glutaredoxins, Trypsin α-amylase inhibitor proteins, and Zf-Dof proteins. Their evolutionary dynamic was investigated to understand how and why such important size variations are observed between these closely related species. We show that expansions resulted from both amplification, largely by tandem duplications, and contraction by gene losses. For the F-box and NB-ARC gene families, the genes conserved in all species were under strong purifying selection while expanded orthologous genes were under more relaxed purifying selection. In F-box, NB-ARC, and BTB, the expanded groups were enriched in genes with little evidence of expression, in comparison with conserved groups. We also detected 87 loci under positive selection in the expanded groups. These results show that most of the duplicated copies in the expanded groups evolve neutrally after duplication because of functional redundancy but a fraction of these genes were preserved following neofunctionalization. Hence, the lineage-specific expansions observed between Oryza species were partly driven by directional selection.
24231918	Mapping and validation of quantitative trait loci associated with concentrations of 16 elements in unmilled rice grain.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: QTLs controlling the concentrations elements in rice grain were identified in two mapping populations. The QTLs were clustered such that most genomic regions were associated with more than one element. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the concentrations of 16 elements in whole, unmilled rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain were identified. Two rice mapping populations, the ‘Lemont’ × ‘TeQing’ recombinant inbred lines (LT-RILs), and the TeQing-into-Lemont backcross introgression lines (TILs) were used. To increase opportunity to detect and characterize QTLs, the TILs were grown under two contrasting field conditions, flooded and irrigated-but-unflooded. Correlations between the individual elements and between each element with grain shape, plant height, and time of heading were also studied. Transgressive segregation was observed among the LT-RILs for all elements. The 134 QTLs identified as associated with the grain concentrations of individual elements were found clustered into 39 genomic regions, 34 of which were found associated with grain element concentration in more than one population and/or flooding treatment. More QTLs were found significant among flooded TILs (92) than among unflooded TILs (47) or among flooded LT-RILs (40). Twenty-seven of the 40 QTLs identified among the LT-RILs were associated with the same element among the TILs. At least one QTL per element was validated in two or more population/environments. Nearly all of the grain element loci were linked to QTLs affecting additional elements, supporting the concept of element networks within plants. Several of the grain element QTLs co-located with QTLs for grain shape, plant height, and days to heading; but did not always differ for grain elemental concentration as predicted by those traits alone. A number of interesting patterns were found, including a strong Mg–P–K complex.
24193246	Microbial degradation of the herbicide molinate by defined cultures and in the environment.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Molinate is a thiocarbamate herbicide used worldwide in rice crop protection. As with other pesticides, molinate is a recognized environmental pollutant, detected in soils, irrigation water, or rivers and bio-accumulated by some wildlife forms. For this reason, and in spite of its low toxicity to humans, environmental protection measures, which include reduction of use and/or remediation processes, are recommended. Due to its physic-chemical properties, molinate can easily disperse and react in the environment, originating diverse transformation products, some with increased toxicity. In spite of being a xenobiotic compound, molinate can also suffer microbial transformation by bacteria or fungi, sometimes serving as nutrient and energy source. In an attempt to isolate microorganisms to be used in the bioremediation of molinate-contaminated sites, a mixed culture, dominated by the actinobacterium Gulosibacter molinativorax ON4(T), was recovered from the runoff of a molinate-producing plant. Beyond a promising tool to decontaminate molinate-polluted sites, this culture also brought interesting insights into the biology of the degradation of this herbicide. In this review, an overview of the distribution and properties of molinate as environmental contaminant, the capability of microorganisms to transform this herbicide, and some reflections about possible bioremediation approaches are made.
24279930	Optimization of solid-state fermentation for phytase production by Thermomyces lanuginosus using response surface methodology.	2014	Prep Biochem Biotechnol	A strain of Thermomyces lanuginosus, isolated from hot spring water in Turkey, was studied for optimization of phytase production using solid-state fermentation. Effects on fermentation of different production parameters such as substrate type, moisture, culture time, and inoculum size were investigated using a one-factor-at-a-time approach. Central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology was applied for the optimization of four factors (culture temperature, initial pH, aeration area, age of seeding culture) that were affecting phytase production by Thermomyces lanuginosus in rice bran. Maximum phytase activity was achieved by using rice bran. The optimum levels of variables that supported maximum enzyme activity were moisture 70%, culture time 7 days, inoculum size 40%, culture temperature 55°C, initial pH 7.5, aeration area 30%, age of seeding culture 5 days, sucrose 1%, and ZnSO4 2.5 mM. An overall 10.83-fold enhancement in phytase activity (0.30 to 3.248 U) was attained due to the optimization.
24214893	Interaction between Rice stripe virus disease-specific protein and host PsbP enhances virus symptoms.	2014	Mol Plant	Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes severe diseases in Oryza sativa (rice) in many Eastern Asian countries. Disease-specific protein (SP) of RSV is a non-structural protein and its accumulation level in rice plant was shown to determine the severity of RSV symptoms. Here, we present evidence that expression of RSV SP alone in rice or Nicotiana benthamiana did not produce visible symptoms. Expression of SP in these two plants, however, enhanced RSV- or Potato virus X (PVX)-induced symptoms. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we demonstrated that RSV SP interacted with PsbP, a 23-kDa oxygen-evolving complex protein, in both rice and N. benthamiana. Furthermore, our investigation showed that silencing of PsbP expression in both plants increased disease symptom severity and virus accumulation. Confocal microscopy using N. benthamiana protoplast showed that PsbP accumulated predominantly in chloroplast in wild-type N. benthamiana cells. In the presence of RSV SP, most PsbP was recruited into cytoplasm of the assayed cells. In addition, accumulation of SP during RSV infection resulted in alterations of chloroplast structure and function. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying RSV disease symptom development.
24148412	Highly sensitive determination of nitric oxide in biologic samples by a near-infrared BODIPY-based fluorescent probe coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography.	2013	Talanta	Nitric oxide (NO) acts as an important regulator and mediator in numerous processes of biological systems. In this work, the analytical potential of a novel near-infrared (NIR, >600 nm) BODIPY-based fluorescent probe for NO, 8-(3,4-diaminophenyl)-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-di(1,2-dihydro) naphtho[b, g]s-indacene (DANPBO-H) has been evaluated in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In 25 mM pH 6.50 borate buffer, DANPBO-H reacted with NO to give the corresponding triazole, DANPBO-H-T, at 35 °C for 20 min. DANPBO-H-T was eluted using a mobile phase of methanol/tetrahydrofuran/50mM pH 7.00 H3Cit-NaOH buffer (81:7:12, v/v/v) in 4 min on a C8 column and detected with fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 621 and 631 nm, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) (signal-to-noise=3) reached to 5.50×10(-10) M. Excellent selectivity was observed against other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Various representative biological matrixes including the whole blood and organs of mice, the pangen and radical of rice, human vascular endothelial (ECV-304) cells and mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells were used to verify the feasibility and resistance to interfering effects from complex biological sample matrixes of the developed DANPBO-H-based HPLC method. Compared to the existing derivatization-based HPLC methods for NO, the proposed method eliminates interfering effects from complex biological sample matrixes efficiently owing to the fluorescence detection in the NIR region, and is more advantageous and robust for the sensitive and selective determination of NO in complex biological samples.
24231122	Characterization of a type D1A EUL-related lectin from rice expressed in Pichia pastoris.	2014	Biol Chem	OrysaEULD1A is one of the five EUL genes in rice (Oryza sativa) encoding a putative carbohydrate-binding protein belonging to the family of Euonymus related lectins (EUL). The OrysaEULD1A sequence comprises two highly similar EUL domains (91% sequence similarity and 72% sequence identity) separated by a 23 amino acid linker sequence and preceded by a 19 amino acid N-terminal sequence. In the present study, the full-length protein OrysaEULD1A as well as its individual domains OrysaEULD1A domain 1 and 2 were expressed in Pichia pastoris. After purification of the recombinant proteins, their carbohydrate-binding specificity was analyzed and compared. Interestingly, all recombinant lectins showed clear specificity towards galactosylated structures. Furthermore, all recombinant proteins agglutinated red blood cells, indicating that the full-length protein OrysaEULD1A and its domains are true lectins. These results taken together with data previously reported for single-domain EUL proteins indicate that although the amino acids--responsible for the formation of the carbohydrate-binding site--are identical for all EUL proteins in rice, these lectins show different carbohydrate specificities. This promiscuity of the carbohydrate-binding site can be attributed to gene divergence.
24201892	Greenhouse gas emissions from rice microcosms amended with a plant microbial fuel cell.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Methane (CH4) release from wetlands is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. Gas exchange occurs mainly through the aerenchyma of plants, and production of greenhouse gases is heavily dependent on rhizosphere biogeochemical conditions (i.e. substrate availability and redox potential). It is hypothesized that by introducing a biocatalyzed anode electrode in the rhizosphere of wetland plants, a competition for carbon and electrons can be invoked between electrical current-generating bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. The anode electrode is part of a bioelectrochemical system (BES) capable of harvesting electrical current from microbial metabolism. In this work, the anode of a BES was introduced in the rhizosphere of rice plants (Oryza sativa), and the impact on methane emissions was monitored. Microbial current generation was able to outcompete methanogenic processes when the bulk matrix contained low concentrations of organic carbon, provided that the electrical circuit with the effective electroactive microorganisms was in place. When interrupting the electrical circuit or supplying an excess of organic carbon, methanogenic metabolism was able to outcompete current generating metabolism. The qPCR results showed hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the most abundant methanogenic group present, while mixotrophic or acetoclastic methanogens were hardly detected in the bulk rhizosphere or on the electrodes. Competition for electron donor and acceptor were likely the main drivers to lower methane emissions. Overall, electrical current generation with BESs is an interesting option to control CH4 emissions from wetlands but needs to be applied in combination with other mitigation strategies to be successful and feasible in practice.
24223754	Repression of tropolone production and induction of a Burkholderia plantarii pseudo-biofilm by carot-4-en-9,10-diol, a cell-to-cell signaling disrupter produced by Trichoderma virens.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The tropolone-tolerant Trichoderma virens PS1-7 is a biocontrol agent against Burkholderia plantarii, causative of rice seedling blight. When exposed to catechol, this fungus dose-dependently produced carot-4-en-9,10-diol, a sesquiterpene-type autoregulatory signal molecule that promotes self-conidiation of T. virens PS1-7 mycelia. It was, however, uncertain why T. virens PS1-7 attenuates the symptom development of the rice seedlings infested with B. plantarii.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To reveal the antagonism by T. virens PS1-7 against B. plantarii leading to repression of tropolone production in a coculture system, bioassay-guided screening for active compounds from a 3-d culture of T. virens PS1-7 was conducted. As a result, carot-4-en-9,10-diol was identified and found to repress tropolone production of B. plantarii from 10 to 200 µM in a dose-dependent manner as well as attenuate virulence of B. plantarii on rice seedlings. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcriptional suppression of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone synthase plaI in B. plantarii was the main mode of action by which carot-4-en-9,10-diol mediated the quorum quenching responsible for repression of tropolone production. In addition, the unique response of B. plantarii to carot-4-en-9,10-diol in the biofilm formed in the static culture system was also found. Although the initial stage of B. plantarii biofilm formation was induced by both tropolone and carot-4-en-9,10-diol, it was induced in different states. Moreover, the B. plantarii biofilm that was induced by carot-4-en-9,10-diol at the late stage showed defects not only in matrix structure but also cell viability.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that carot-4-en-9,10-diol released by T. virens PS1-7 acts as an interkingdom cell-to-cell signaling molecule against B. plantarii to repress tropolone production and induces pseudo-biofilm to the cells. This observation also led to another discovery that tropolone is an autoregulatory cell-to-cell signaling molecule of B. plantarii that induces a functional biofilm other than a simple B. plantarii virulence factor.
24220652	Endoreduplication is not involved in bundle-sheath formation in the C4 species Cleome gynandra.	2014	J Exp Bot	There is currently significant interest in engineering the two-celled C4 photosynthesis pathway into crops such as rice in order to increase yield. This will require alterations to the biochemistry of photosynthesis in both mesophyll (M) and bundle-sheath (BS) cells, but also alterations to leaf anatomy. For example, the BS of C4 species is enlarged compared with that in C3 species. Because cell and nucleus size are often correlated, this study investigated whether nuclear endoreduplication is associated with increased differentiation and expansion of BS cells. Nuclei in the BS of C4 Cleome gynandra were tagged with green fluorescent protein. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy and flow cytometry of isolated nuclei were used to quantify size and DNA content in BS cells. The results showed a significant endoreduplication in BS cells of C. gynandra but not in additional C4 lineages from both the monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous plants. Furthermore, in the C3 species Arabidopsis thaliana, BS cells undergo endoreduplication. Due to this significant endoreduplication in the small BS cells of C3 A. thaliana, it was concluded that endoreduplication of BS nuclei in C4 plants is not linked to expansion and differentiation of BS cells, and therefore that alternative strategies to increase this compartment need to be sought in order to engineer C4 traits into C3 crops such as rice.
24244664	Transgenerational variations in DNA methylation induced by drought stress in two rice varieties with distinguished difference to drought resistance.	2013	PLoS One	Adverse environmental conditions have large impacts on plant growth and crop production. One of the crucial mechanisms that plants use in variable and stressful natural environments is gene expression modulation through epigenetic modification. In this study, two rice varieties with different drought resistance levels were cultivated under drought stress from tilling stage to seed filling stage for six successive generations. The variations in DNA methylation of the original generation (G0) and the sixth generation (G6) of these two varieties in normal condition (CK) and under drought stress (DT) at seedling stage were assessed by using Methylation Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism (MSAP) method. The results revealed that drought stress had a cumulative effect on the DNA methylation pattern of both varieties, but these two varieties had different responses to drought stress in DNA methylation. The DNA methylation levels of II-32B (sensitive) and Huhan-3 (resistant) were around 39% and 32%, respectively. Genome-wide DNA methylation variations among generations or treatments accounted for around 13.1% of total MSAP loci in II-32B, but was only approximately 1.3% in Huhan-3. In II-32B, 27.6% of total differentially methylated loci (DML) were directly induced by drought stress and 3.2% of total DML stably transmitted their changed DNA methylation status to the next generation. In Huhan-3, the numbers were 48.8% and 29.8%, respectively. Therefore, entrainment had greater effect on Huhan-3 than on II-32B. Sequence analysis revealed that the DML were widely distributed on all 12 rice chromosomes and that it mainly occurred on the gene's promoter and exon region. Some genes with DML respond to environmental stresses. The inheritance of epigenetic variations induced by drought stress may provide a new way to develop drought resistant rice varieties.
24270514	Abscisic acid metabolizing rhizobacteria decrease ABA concentrations in planta and alter plant growth.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Although endogenous phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) regulate root growth, and many rhizobacteria can modulate root phytohormone status, hitherto there have been no reports of rhizobacteria mediating root ABA concentrations and growth by metabolising ABA. Using a selective ABA-supplemented medium, two bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings grown in sod-podzolic soil and assigned to Rhodococcus sp. P1Y and Novosphingobium sp. P6W using partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phenotypic patterns by the GEN III MicroPlate test. Although strain P6W had more rapid growth in ABA-supplemented media than strain P1Y, both could utilize ABA as a sole carbon source in batch culture. When rice seeds were germinated on filter paper in association with bacteria, root ABA concentration was not affected, but shoot ABA concentration of inoculated plants decreased by 14% (strain P6W) and 22% (strain P1Y). When tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genotypes differing in ABA biosynthesis (ABA deficient mutants flacca - flc, and notabilis - not and the wild-type cv. Ailsa Craig, WT) were grown in gnotobiotic cultures on nutrient solution agar, rhizobacterial inoculation decreased root and/or leaf ABA concentrations, depending on plant and bacteria genotypes. Strain P6W inhibited primary root elongation of all genotypes, but increased leaf biomass of WT plants. In WT plants treated with silver ions that inhibit ethylene perception, both ABA-metabolising strains significantly decreased root ABA concentration, and strain P6W decreased leaf ABA concentration. Since these changes in ABA status also occurred in plants that were not treated with silver, it suggests that ethylene was probably not involved in regulating bacteria-mediated changes in ABA concentration. Correlations between plant growth and ABA concentrations in planta suggest that ABA-metabolising rhizobacteria may stimulate growth via an ABA-dependent mechanism.
24280269	Isolation of a novel mutant gene for soil-surface rooting in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Root system architecture is an important trait affecting the uptake of nutrients and water by crops. Shallower root systems preferentially take up nutrients from the topsoil and help avoid unfavorable environments in deeper soil layers. We have found a soil-surface rooting mutant from an M2 population that was regenerated from seed calli of a japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. In this study, we examined the genetic and physiological characteristics of this mutant.

RESULTS: The primary roots of the mutant showed no gravitropic response from the seedling stage on, whereas the gravitropic response of the shoots was normal. Segregation analyses by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the soil-surface rooting mutant and wild-type Nipponbare indicated that the trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, designated as sor1. Fine mapping by using an F2 population derived from a cross between the mutant and an indica rice cultivar, Kasalath, revealed that sor1 was located within a 136-kb region between the simple sequence repeat markers RM16254 and 2935-6 on the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 4, where 13 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were found. We sequenced these ORFs and detected a 33-bp deletion in one of them, Os04g0101800. Transgenic plants of the mutant transformed with the genomic fragment carrying the Os04g0101800 sequence from Nipponbare showed normal gravitropic responses and no soil-surface rooting.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sor1, a rice mutant causing soil-surface rooting and altered root gravitropic response, is allelic to Os04g0101800, and that a 33-bp deletion in the coding region of this gene causes the mutant phenotypes.
23994306	One-step production of biodiesel from rice bran oil catalyzed by chlorosulfonic acid modified zirconia via simultaneous esterification and transesterification.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Due to the high content (25-50%) of free fatty acid (FFA), crude rice bran oil usually requires a two steps conversion or one step conversion with very harsh condition for simultaneous esterification and transesterification. In this study, chlorosulfonic acid modified zirconia (HClSO3-ZrO2) with strong acidity and durability is prepared and it shows excellent catalytic activity toward simultaneous esterification and transesterification. Under a relative low reaction temperature of 120 °C, HClSO3-ZrO2 catalyzes a complete conversion of simulated crude rice bran oil (refined oil with 40 wt% FFA) into biodiesel and the conversion yield keep at above 92% for at least three cycles. Further investigation on the tolerance towards FFA and water reveals that it maintains high activity even with the presence of 40 wt% FFA and 3 wt% water. It shows that HClSO3-ZrO2 is a robust and durable catalyst which shows high potential to be commercial catalyst for biodiesel production from low grade feedstock.
24283297	QTL mapping reveals a tight linkage between QTLs for grain weight and panicle spikelet number in rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: A number of QTL studies reported that one genomic region was associated with several traits, indicating linkage and/or pleiotropic effects. The question of pleiotropy versus tight linkage in these studies should be solved using a large-size population combined with high-density mapping. For example, if each of the 2 parents has a TGW-increasing or SPP-increasing QTL that is tightly linked, complementary combination of the 2 beneficial QTLs by using molecular markers could produce higher yields compared to the 2 parents. However, a pleiotropic QTL with opposite effects on the SPP and 1,000-grain weight (TGW) is complicated and challenging in terms of its application to rice improvement.

RESULTS: In this study, using a series of BC5F4 nearly isogenic lines (NILs) that were derived from a cross between the Korean japonica cultivar Hwayeongbyeo and Oryza rufipogon, we demonstrated that 2 QTLs, qSPP5 for spikelets per panicle (SPP) and qTGW5 for grain weight (TGW), are tightly linked on chromosome 5. Alleles from the O. rufipogon parent increased the SPP and decreased TGW in the Hwayeongbyeo background. qSPP5 was located within a 803-kb interval between the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers INDEL3 and RM18076. Based on the map position, qTGW5 seemed to be the same gene as qSW5, which controls grain morphology. The additive effect of the O. rufipogon allele at qSPP5 was 10-15 SPP, and 33.0% of the phenotypic variance could be explained by the segregation of the SSR marker RM18058. Yield trials with BC5F4 NILs showed that lines that contained a homozygous O. rufipogon introgression at the qSPP5 region out-yielded sibling NILs that contained Hwayeongbyeo DNA by 15.3% and out-yielded the Hwayeongbyeo parent by 7.3%.

CONCLUSION: Based on the finding that the O. rufipogon allele for the SPP was beneficial in the japonica and indica cultivar backgrounds, the qSPP5 allele could be valuable for improving rice yields. In addition, the NIL populations and molecular markers are useful for cloning qSPP5.
24185848	Metabolic engineering of the regulators in nitrogen catabolite repression to reduce the production of ethyl carbamate in a model rice wine system.	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	Rice wine has been one of the most popular traditional alcoholic drinks in China. However, the presence of potentially carcinogenic ethyl carbamate (EC) in rice wine has raised a series of food safety issues. During rice wine production, the key reason for EC formation is urea accumulation, which occurs because of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NCR represses urea utilization by retaining Gln3p in the cytoplasm when preferred nitrogen sources are present. In order to increase the nuclear localization of Gln3p, some possible phosphorylation sites on the nuclear localization signal were mutated and the nuclear localization regulation signal was truncated, and the disruption of URE2 provided an additional method of reducing urea accumulation. By combining these strategies, the genes involved in urea utilization (DUR1,2 and DUR3) could be significantly activated in the presence of glutamine. During shake flask fermentations of the genetically modified strains, very little urea accumulated in the medium. Furthermore, the concentrations of urea and EC were reduced by 63% and 72%, respectively, in a model rice wine system. Examination of the normal nutrients in rice wine indicated that there were few differences in fermentation characteristics between the wild-type strain and the genetically modified strain. These results show that metabolic engineering of the NCR regulators has great potential as a method for eliminating EC during rice wine production.
24279508	Two splicing variants of a novel family of octopamine receptors with different signaling properties.	2014	J Neurochem	The octopamine and tyramine, as the invertebrate counterparts of the vertebrate adrenergic transmitters, control and modulate many physiological and behavioral processes. Both molecules mediate their effects by binding to specific receptors belonging to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. So far, four families of octopamine and tyramine receptors have been reported. Here, we described the functional characterization of one putative octopamine/tyramine receptor gene from the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. By a mechanism of alternative splicing, this receptor gene (CsOA3) encodes two molecularly distinct transcripts, CsOA3S and CsOA3L. CsOA3L differs from CsOA3S on account of the presence of an additional 30 amino acids within the third intracellular loop. When heterologously expressed, both receptors cause increases of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. The short form, CsOA3S, was activated by both octopamine and tyramine, resulting in decreased intracellular cAMP levels ([cAMP]i ) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas dopamine and serotonin are not effective. However, CsOA3L did not show any impact on [cAMP]i . Studies with series of agonists and antagonists confirmed that CsOA3 has a different pharmacological profile from that of other octopamine receptor families. The CsOA3 is, to our knowledge, a novel family of insect octopamine receptors.
24244410	Transgenic Bt rice does not challenge host preference of the target pest of rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Transgenic Bt rice line T2A-1 expresses a synthesized cry2A gene that shows high resistance to Lepidoptera pests, including Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Plant volatile orientation cues and the physical characteristics of the leaf surface play key roles in host location or host-plant acceptance of phytophagous insects. These volatile compounds and physical traits may become altered in Bt rice and it is not known whether this influences the behavior of C. medinalis when searching for oviposition sites.

RESULTS: The results of electronic nose analysis showed that the Radar map of Bt rice cultivars was analogous to the non- Bt rice cultivars at each growing stage. PCA analysis was able to partly discriminate between some of the Bt vs. non-Bt rice sensors, but could not to separate Bt cultivars from non-Bt cultivars. The total ion chromatogram between Bt and non-Bt rice cultivars at the seedling, booting and tillering stages were similar and 25 main compounds were identified by GC-MS. For most compounds, there was no significant difference in compound quantities between Bt and non-Bt rice cultivars at equivalent growth stages. The densities of the tubercle papicles and the trichomes on the upper and lower surfaces were statistically equal in Bt and non-Bt rice. The target pest, C. medinalis, was attracted to host rice plants, but it could not distinguish between the transgenic and the isogenic rice lines.

CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between the Bt rice line, T2A-1 and the non-Bt rice for volatiles produced or in its physical characteristics and there were no negative impacts on C. medinalis oviposition behavior. These results add to the mounting evidence that Bt rice has no negative impact on the target insect oviposition behavior.
24235132	Machine learning approaches distinguish multiple stress conditions using stress-responsive genes and identify candidate genes for broad resistance in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Abiotic and biotic stress responses are traditionally thought to be regulated by discrete signaling mechanisms. Recent experimental evidence revealed a more complex picture where these mechanisms are highly entangled and can have synergistic and antagonistic effects on each other. In this study, we identified shared stress-responsive genes between abiotic and biotic stresses in rice (Oryza sativa) by performing meta-analyses of microarray studies. About 70% of the 1,377 common differentially expressed genes showed conserved expression status, and the majority of the rest were down-regulated in abiotic stresses and up-regulated in biotic stresses. Using dimension reduction techniques, principal component analysis, and partial least squares discriminant analysis, we were able to segregate abiotic and biotic stresses into separate entities. The supervised machine learning model, recursive-support vector machine, could classify abiotic and biotic stresses with 100% accuracy using a subset of differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, using a random forests decision tree model, eight out of 10 stress conditions were classified with high accuracy. Comparison of genes contributing most to the accurate classification by partial least squares discriminant analysis, recursive-support vector machine, and random forests revealed 196 common genes with a dynamic range of expression levels in multiple stresses. Functional enrichment and coexpression network analysis revealed the different roles of transcription factors and genes responding to phytohormones or modulating hormone levels in the regulation of stress responses. We envisage the top-ranked genes identified in this study, which highly discriminate abiotic and biotic stresses, as key components to further our understanding of the inherently complex nature of multiple stress responses in plants.
23995923	Substrate-induced transcriptional activation of the MoCel7C cellulase gene is associated with methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Appl Environ Microbiol	The mechanisms involved in substrate-dependent regulation of a Magnaporthe oryzae gene encoding a cellulase which we designate MoCel7C (MGG_14954) were investigated. The levels of MoCel7C transcript were dramatically increased more than 1,000-fold, 16 to 24 h after transfer to a medium containing 2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), while levels were very low or undetectable in conventional rich medium. Green fluorescent protein reporter assays showed that the MoCel7C promoter was activated by cello-oligosaccharides larger than a pentamer. CMC-induced activation of the MoCel7C promoter was suppressed by glucose and cellobiose. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that histone H3 methylation on lysine 4 (H3K4) at the MoCel7C locus was associated with activation of the gene by CMC. Consistently, CMC-induced MoCel7C gene activation was drastically diminished in a knockout (KO) mutant of the MoSET1 gene, which encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K4 methylation in M. oryzae. Interestingly, however, MoCel7C transcript levels under noninducing conditions were significantly increased in the MoSET1 KO mutant, suggesting that MoSET1 directly or indirectly plays a role in both activation and suppression of the MoCel7C gene in response to environmental signals. In addition, gene expression and silencing vectors using the MoCel7C promoter were constructed.
24200076	Two distinct EF-Tu epitopes induce immune responses in rice and Arabidopsis.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plants sense potential pathogens by recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that cause PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). We previously reported that rice recognizes flagellin from the rice-incompatible N1141 strain of Acidovorax avenae and subsequently induces immune responses. Cell extracts isolated from flagellin-deficient N1141 (Δfla1141) still induced PTI responses, suggesting that Δfla1141 possesses an additional PAMP distinct from flagellin. Here, we show that elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), one of the most abundant bacterial proteins, acts as a PAMP in rice and causes several PTI responses. In Brassicaceae species, EF-Tu and an N-acetylated peptide comprising the first 18 amino acids of the N-terminus, termed elf18, are fully active as inducers of PTI responses. By contrast, elf18 did not cause any immune responses in rice, whereas an EF-Tu middle region comprising Lys176 to Gly225, termed EFa50, is fully active as a PAMP in rice. In the leaves of rice plants, EF-Tu induced H2O2 generation and callose deposition, and also triggered resistance to coinfection with pathogenic bacteria. Taken together, these data demonstrate that rice recognizes EFa50, which is distinct from elf18, and that this epitope induces PTI responses.
24241166	Genome-wide analysis of the bHLH transcription factor family in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis).	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and are thought to be one of the largest families of regulatory proteins. This important family of transcriptional regulators plays crucial roles in plant development. However, a systematic analysis of the bHLH transcription factor family has not been reported in Chinese cabbage. In this study, 230 bHLH transcription factors were identified from the whole Chinese cabbage genome and compared with proteins from other representative plants, fungi and metazoans. The Chinese cabbage bHLH (BrabHLH) gene family could be classified into 24 subfamilies. Phylogenetic analysis of BrabHLHs along with bHLHs from Arabidopsis and rice indicated 26 subfamilies. The identification, classification, phylogenetic reconstruction, conserved motifs, chromosome distribution, functional annotation, expression patterns and interaction networks of BrabHLHs were analyzed. Distribution mapping showed that BrabHLHs were non-randomly located on the ten Chinese cabbage chromosomes. One hundred and twenty-four orthologous bHLH genes were identified between Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis, and the interaction networks of the orthologous genes were constructed in Chinese cabbage. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that expressions of BrabHLH genes varied widely under different abiotic stress treatments for different times. Thus, this comprehensive analysis of BrabHLHs represents a rich resource, aiding the elucidation of the roles of bHLH family members in plant growth and development. Furthermore, the comparative genomics analysis deepened our understanding of the evolution of this gene family after a polyploidy event.
24250219	Identification of new aquaporin genes and single nucleotide polymorphism in bread wheat.	2013	Evol Bioinform Online	Major facilitators of water movement through plant cell membranes include aquaporin proteins. Wheat is among the largest and most important cereal crops worldwide; however, unlike other model plants such as rice, maize and Arabidopsis, little has been reported on wheat major intrinsic proteins (MIPs). This study presents a comprehensive computational identification of 349 new wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs), encoding 13 wheat aquaporin genes. Identified aquaporins consist of 6 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) and 1 TIP showing high sequence similarity with rice aquaporins. We also identified 4 NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIP) and 2 SIP members that showed more divergence. Further, expression analysis of the aquaporin genes using the available EST information in UniGene revealed their transcripts were differentially regulated in various stress- and tissue-specific libraries. Allele specific Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were designed using PIP as the target gene and validated on a core set of Indian wheat genotypes. A 3D theoretical model of the wheat aquaporin protein was built by homology modeling and could prove to be useful in the further functional characterization of this protein. Collectively with expression and bioinformatics analysis, our results support the idea that the genes identified in this study signify an important genetic resource providing potential targets to modify the water use properties of wheat.
24274685	High-resolution hydrodynamic chromatographic separation of large DNA using narrow, bare open capillaries: a rapid and economical alternative technology to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis?	2014	Anal Chem	A high-resolution, rapid, and economical hydrodynamic chromatographic (HDC) method for large DNA separations in free solution was developed using narrow (5 μm diameter), bare open capillaries. Size-based separation was achieved in a chromatographic format with larger DNA molecules being eluting faster than smaller ones. Lambda DNA Mono Cut Mix was baseline-separated with the percentage resolutions generally less than 9.0% for all DNA fragments (1.5 to 48.5 kbp) tested in this work. High efficiencies were achieved for large DNA from this chromatographic technique, and the number of theoretical plates reached 3.6 × 10(5) plates for the longest (48.5 kbp) and 3.7 × 10(5) plates for the shortest (1.5 kbp) fragments. HDC parameters and performances were also discussed. The method was further applied for fractionating large DNA fragments from real-world samples (SacII digested Arabidopsis plant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA and PmeI digested Rice BAC DNA) to demonstrate its feasibility for BAC DNA finger printing. Rapid separation of PmeI digested Rice BAC DNA covering from 0.44 to 119.041 kbp was achieved in less than 26 min. All DNA fragments of these samples were baseline separated in narrow bare open capillaries, while the smallest fragment (0.44 kbp) was missing in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) separation mode. It is demonstrated that narrow bare open capillary chromatography can realize a rapid separation for a wide size range of DNA mixtures that contain both small and large DNA fragments in a single run.
24244592	Dynamic quantitative trait loci analysis of seed reserve utilization during three germination stages in rice.	2013	PLoS One	In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of seed reserve utilization during the early (day 6), middle (day 10) and late (day 14) germination stages. The seedling dry weight (SDW) and weight of the mobilized seed reserve (WMSR) were increased, while the seed reserve utilization efficiency (SRUE) decreased, during the process of seed germination. The SDW and WMSR were affected by the seed weight, while the SRUE was not affected by the seed weight. A total of twenty unconditional and twenty-one conditional additive QTLs and eight epistatic QTLs were identified at three germination stages, and the more QTLs were expressed at the late germination stage. Among them, twelve additive and three epistatic QTLs for SDW, eight additive and three epistatic QTLs for WMSR and thirteen additive and two epistatic QTLs for SRUE were identified, respectively. The phenotypic variation explained by each additive QTL, epistatic QTL and QTL × development interaction ranged from 6.10 to 23.91%, 1.79 to 6.88% and 0.22 to 2.86%, respectively. Two major additive QTLs qWMSR7.1 and qSRUE4.3 were identified, and each QTL could explain more than 20% of the total phenotypic variance. By comparing the chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, eleven QTLs might represent novel genes. The best four cross combinations of each trait for the development of RIL populations were selected. The selected RILs and the identified QTLs might be applicable to improve rice seed reserve utilization by the marker-assisted selection approach.
24191997	Isolation and identification of a lethal rhabdovirus from farmed rice field eels Monopterus albus.	2013	Dis Aquat Organ	We provide the first description of a virus responsible for a systemic hemorrhagic disease causing high mortality in farmed rice field eels Monopterus albus in China. Typical signs exhibited by the diseased fish were extensive hemorrhages in the skin and viscera and some neurological signs, such as loss of equilibrium and disorganized swimming. Histopathological examination revealed various degrees of necrosis within the spleen and liver. Virus isolation was attempted from visceral tissues of diseased fish by inoculation on 6 fish cell lines. Typical cytopathic effects (CPE) were produced in bluegill fry (BF2) cells, so this cell line was chosen for further isolation and propagation of the virus. Electron microscopy observation showed that the negative stained viral particles had the characteristic bullet shape of rhabdoviruses and an estimated size of 60 × 120 nm. We therefore tentatively refer to this virus as Monopterus albus rhabdovirus (MoARV). Molecular characterization of MoARV, including sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and glycoprotein (G) genes, revealed 94.5 to 97.3% amino acid similarity to that of Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of N and G proteins indicated that MoARV should be a member of the genus Vesiculovirus. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by infecting healthy rice field eels with MoARV, which produced an acute infection. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MoARV RNA could be detected in both naturally and experimentally infected fish. The data suggest that MoARV was the causative pathogen of the disease.
24192013	Differential expression of CPKs and cytosolic Ca2+ variation in resistant and susceptible apple cultivars (Malus x domestica) in response to the pathogen Erwinia amylovora and mechanical wounding.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant calcium (Ca2+) signals are involved in a wide array of intracellular signalling pathways following pathogen invasion. Ca2+-binding sensory proteins such as Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) have been predicted to mediate signalling following Ca2+ influx after pathogen infection. However, to date this prediction has remained elusive.

RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide identification of the Malus x domestica CPK (MdCPK) gene family and identified 30 CPK genes. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of Malus CPKs with CPKs of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCPKs), Oryza sativa (OsCPKs), Populous trichocarpa (PtCPKs) and Zea mays (ZmCPKs) revealed four different groups. From the phylogenetic tree, we found that MdCPKs are closely related to AtCPKs and PtCPKs rather than OsCPKs and ZmCPKs, indicating their dicot-specific origin. Furthermore, comparative quantitative real time PCR and intracellular cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) analysis were carried out on fire blight resistant and susceptible M. x domestica apple cultivars following infection with a pathogen (Erwinia amylovora) and/or mechanical damage. Calcium analysis showed an increased [Ca2+]cyt over time in resistant cultivars as compared to susceptible cultivars. Gene expression studies showed that 11 out of the 30 MdCPKs were differentially expressed following pathogen infection.

CONCLUSIONS: We studied the genome-wide analysis of MdCPK gene family in Malus x domestica and analyzed their differential gene expression along with cytosolic calcium variation upon pathogen infection. There was a striking difference in MdCPKs gene expressions and [Ca2+]cyt variations between resistant and susceptible M. x domestica cultivars in response to E. amylovora and mechanical wounding. Our genomic and bioinformatic analysis provided an important insight about the role of MdCPKs in modulating defence responses in susceptible and resistant apple cultivars. It also provided further information on early signalling and downstream signalling cascades in response to pathogenic and mechanical stress.
24267591	An in vitro system for the rapid functional characterization of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation.	2014	Plant J	We have developed an assay based on rice embryogenic callus for rapid functional characterization of metabolic genes. We validated the assay using a selection of well-characterized genes with known functions in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, allowing rapid visual screening of callus phenotypes based on tissue color. We then used the system to identify the functions of two uncharacterized genes: a chemically synthesized β-carotene ketolase gene optimized for maize codon usage, and a wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog of the cauliflower Orange gene. In contrast to previous reports (Lopez, A.B., Van Eck, J., Conlin, B.J., Paolillo, D.J., O'Neill, J. and Li, L. () J. Exp. Bot. 59, 213-223; Lu, S., Van Eck, J., Zhou, X., Lopez, A.B., O'Halloran, D.M., Cosman, K.M., Conlin, B.J., Paolillo, D.J., Garvin, D.F., Vrebalov, J., Kochian, L.V., Küpper, H., Earle, E.D., Cao, J. and Li, L. () Plant Cell 18, 3594-3605), we found that the wild-type Orange allele was sufficient to induce chromoplast differentiation. We also found that chromoplast differentiation was induced by increasing the availability of precursors and thus driving flux through the pathway, even in the absence of Orange. Remarkably, we found that diverse endosperm-specific promoters were highly active in rice callus despite their restricted activity in mature plants. Our callus system provides a unique opportunity to predict the effect of metabolic engineering in complex pathways, and provides a starting point for quantitative modeling and the rational design of engineering strategies using synthetic biology. We discuss the impact of our data on analysis and engineering of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.
24239699	Molecular characterization of the PR-toxin gene cluster in Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium chrysogenum: cross talk of secondary metabolite pathways.	2014	Fungal Genet Biol	The PR-toxin is a potent mycotoxin produced by Penicillium roqueforti in moulded grains and grass silages and may contaminate blue-veined cheese. The PR-toxin derives from the 15 carbon atoms sesquiterpene aristolochene formed by the aristolochene synthase (encoded by ari1). We have cloned and sequenced a four gene cluster that includes the ari1 gene from P. roqueforti. Gene silencing of each of the four genes (named prx1 to prx4) resulted in a reduction of 65-75% in the production of PR-toxin indicating that the four genes encode enzymes involved in PR-toxin biosynthesis. Interestingly the four silenced mutants overproduce large amounts of mycophenolic acid, an antitumor compound formed by an unrelated pathway suggesting a cross-talk of PR-toxin and mycophenolic acid production. An eleven gene cluster that includes the above mentioned four prx genes and a 14-TMS drug/H(+) antiporter was found in the genome of Penicillium chrysogenum. This eleven gene cluster has been reported to be very poorly expressed in a transcriptomic study of P. chrysogenum genes under conditions of penicillin production (strongly aerated cultures). We found that this apparently silent gene cluster is able to produce PR-toxin in P. chrysogenum under static culture conditions on hydrated rice medium. Noteworthily, the production of PR-toxin was 2.6-fold higher in P. chrysogenum npe10, a strain deleted in the 56.8kb amplifiable region containing the pen gene cluster, than in the parental strain Wisconsin 54-1255 providing another example of cross-talk between secondary metabolite pathways in this fungus. A detailed PR-toxin biosynthesis pathway is proposed based on all available evidence.
24192297	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Maintenance of organ separation is one of the essential phenomena for normal plant development. We have identified and analyzed ONION3 (ONI3), which is required for avoiding organ fusions in rice. Loss-of-function mutations of ONI3, which were identified as mutants with ectopic expression of KNOX genes in leaves and morphologically resembling KNOX overexpressors, showed abnormal organ fusions in developing shoots. The mutant seedlings showed fusions between neighboring organs and also within an organ; they stopped growing soon after germination and subsequently died. ONI3 was shown to encode an enzyme that is most similar to Arabidopsis HOTHEAD and is involved in biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids. Expression analyses showed that ONI3 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer in the shoot apex throughout life cycle, and the oni3 mutants had an aberrant outermost cell layer. Our results together with previous studies suggest that long-chain fatty acids are required for avoiding organ fusions and promoting normal shoot development in rice.
24247851	Overexpression of an adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor gene from the halophytic grass Spartina alterniflora confers salinity and drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that play an important role in intracellular protein trafficking necessary for undertaking multiple physiological functions in plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known about the mechanism of ARF functioning at the molecular level, as well as its involvement in abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, we demonstrated the direct involvement of an ARF gene SaARF from a grass halophyte Spartina alterniflora in abiotic stress adaptation for the first time. SaARF, which encodes a protein with predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa, revealed highest identity with ARF of Oryza sativa. The SaARF gene is transcriptionally regulated by salt, drought, cold, and ABA in the leaves and roots of S. alterniflora. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing SaARF showed improved seed germination and survival of seedlings under salinity stress. Similarly, SaARF transgenic Arabidopsis plants were more tolerant to drought stress, compared to wild-type plants, by maintaining chlorophyll synthesis, increasing osmolyte synthesis, and stabilizing membrane integrity. Oxidative damage due to moisture stress in transgenic Arabidopsis was also reduced possibly by activating antioxidant genes, AtSOD1 and AtCAT. Our results suggest that enhanced drought and salinity tolerance conferred by the SaARF gene may be due to its role in mediating multiple abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms.
24260239	Overexpression of rice black-streaked dwarf virus p7-1 in Arabidopsis results in male sterility due to non-dehiscent anthers.	2013	PLoS One	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae, is propagatively transmitted by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén). RBSDV causes rice black-streaked dwarf and maize rough dwarf diseases, which lead to severe yield losses in crops in China. Although several RBSDV proteins have been studied in detail, the functions of the nonstructural protein P7-1 are still largely unknown. To investigate the role of the P7-1 protein in virus pathogenicity, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were generated in which the P7-1 gene was expressed under the control of the 35S promoter. The RBSDV P7-1-transgenic Arabidopsis plants (named P7-1-OE) were male sterility. Flowers and pollen from P7-1-transgenic plants were of normal size and shape, and anthers developed to the normal size but failed to dehisce. The non-dehiscent anthers observed in P7-1-OE were attributed to decreased lignin content in the anthers. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species levels were quite low in the transgenic plants compared with the wild type. These results indicate that ectopic expression of the RBSDV P7-1 protein in A. thaliana causes male sterility, possibly through the disruption of the lignin biosynthesis and H2O2-dependent polymerization pathways.
24197785	Co-expression of RCH10 and AGLU1 confers rice resistance to fungal sheath blight Rhizoctonia solani and blast Magnorpathe oryzae and reveals impact on seed germination.	2014	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Rice sheath blight and blast caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kühn and Magnorpathe oryzae respectively, are the two most destructive fungal diseases in rice. With no genetic natural traits conferring resistance to sheath blight, transgenic manipulation provides an obvious approach. In this study, the rice basic chitinase gene (RCH10) and the alfalfa β-1,3-glucanase gene (AGLU1) were tandemly inserted into transformation vector pBI101 under the control of 35S promoter with its enhancer sequence to generate a double-defense gene expression cassette pZ100. The pZ100 cassette was transformed into rice (cv. Taipei 309) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. More than 160 independent transformants were obtained and confirmed by PCR. Northern analysis of inheritable progenies revealed similar levels of both RCH10 and AGLU1 transcripts in the same individuals. Disease resistance to both sheath blight and blast was challenged in open field inoculation. Immunogold detection revealed that RCH10 and AGLU1 proteins were initially located mainly in the chloroplasts and were delivered to the vacuole and cell wall upon infection, suggesting that these subcellular compartments act as the gathering and execution site for these anti-fungal proteins. We also observed that transgenic seeds display lower germination rate and seedling vigor, indicating that defense enhancement might be achieved at the expense of development.
24185032	Behavioral and histological outcomes following neonatal HI injury in a preterm (P3) and term (P7) rodent model.	2014	Behav Brain Res	Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) occurs when blood and/or oxygen delivery to the brain is compromised. HI injuries can occur in infants born prematurely (<37 weeks gestational age) or at very low birth weight (<1500 g), as well as in term infants with birth complications. In both preterm and term HI populations, brain injury is associated with subsequent behavioral deficits. Neonatal HI injury can be modeled in rodents (e.g., the Rice-Vannucci method, via cautery of right carotid followed by hypoxia). When this injury is induced early in life (between postnatal day (P)1-5), neuropathologies typical of human preterm HI are modeled. When injury is induced later (P7-12), neuropathologies typical of those seen in HI term infants are modeled. The current study sought to characterize the similarities/differences between outcomes following early (P3) and late (P7) HI injury in rats. Male rats with HI injury on P3 or P7, as well as sham controls, were tested on a variety of behavioral tasks in both juvenile and adult periods. Results showed that P7 HI rats displayed deficits on motor learning, rapid auditory processing (RAP), and other learning/memory tasks, as well as a reduction in volume in various neuroanatomical structures. P3 HI animals showed only transient deficits on RAP tasks in the juvenile period (but not in adulthood), yet robust deficits on a visual attention task in adulthood. P3 HI animals did not show any significant reductions in brain volume that we could detect. These data suggest that: (1) behavioral deficits following neonatal HI are task-specific depending on timing of injury; (2) P3 HI rats showed transient deficits on RAP tasks; (3) the more pervasive behavioral deficits seen following P7 HI injury were associated with substantial global tissue loss; and (4) persistent deficits in attention in P3 HI subjects might be linked to neural connectivity disturbances rather than a global loss of brain volume, given that no such pathology was found. These combined findings can be applied to our understanding of differing long-term outcomes following neonatal HI injury in premature versus term infants.
24243689	Protein interactome analysis of 12 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase in rice using a yeast two-hybrid system.	2014	Proteomics	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is composed at least of MAP3K (for MAPK kinase kinase), MAP2K, and MAPK family modules. These components together play a central role in mediating extracellular signals to the cell and vice versa by interacting with their partner proteins. However, the MAP3K-interacting proteins remain poorly investigated in plants. Here, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in the model crop rice (Oryza sativa) to map MAP3K-interacting proteins. We identified 12 novel nonredundant interacting protein pairs (IPPs) representing 11 nonredundant interactors using 12 rice MAP3Ks (available as full-length cDNA in the rice KOME (http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA/) at the time of experimental design and execution) as bait and a rice seedling cDNA library as prey. Of the 12 MAP3Ks, only six had interacting protein partners. The established MAP3K interactome consisted of two kinases, three proteases, two forkhead-associated domain-containing proteins, two expressed proteins, one E3 ligase, one regulatory protein, and one retrotransposon protein. Notably, no MAP3K showed physical interaction with either MAP2K or MAPK. Seven IPPs (58.3%) were confirmed in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Subcellular localization of 14 interactors, together involved in nine IPPs (75%) further provide prerequisite for biological significance of the IPPs. Furthermore, GO of identified interactors predicted their involvement in diverse physiological responses, which were supported by a literature survey. These findings increase our knowledge of the MAP3K-interacting proteins, help in proposing a model of MAPK modules, provide a valuable resource for developing a complete map of the rice MAPK interactome, and allow discussion for translating the interactome knowledge to rice crop improvement against environmental factors.
24280346	Diversity and genetics of nitrogen-induced susceptibility to the blast fungus in rice and wheat.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Nitrogen often increases disease susceptibility, a phenomenon that can be observed under controlled conditions and called NIS, for Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility. NIS has long been reported in the case of rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We used an experimental system that does not strongly affect plant development to address the question of NIS polymorphism across rice diversity and further explored this phenomenon in wheat. We tested the two major types of resistance, namely quantitative/partial resistance and resistance driven by known resistance genes. Indeed there are conflicting reports on the effects of NIS on the first one and none on the last one. Finally, the genetics of NIS is not well documented and only few loci have been identified that may control this phenomenon.

RESULTS: Our data indicate that NIS is a general phenomenon affecting resistance to blast fungus in these two cereals. We show that the capacity of rice to display NIS is highly polymorphic and does not correlate with difference related to indica/japonica sub-groups. We also tested the robustness of three different major resistance genes under high nitrogen. Nitrogen partially breaks down resistance triggered by the Pi1 gene. Cytological examination indicates that penetration rate is not affected by high nitrogen whereas growth of the fungus is increased inside the plant. Using the CSSL mapping population between Nipponbare and Kasalath, we identified a Kasalath locus on chromosome 1, called NIS1, which dominantly increases susceptibility under high nitrogen. We discuss the possible relationships between Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), disease resistance regulation and NIS.

CONCLUSIONS: This work provides evidences that robust forms of partial resistance exist across diversity and can be easily identified with our protocol. This work also suggests that under certain environmental circumstances, complete resistance may breakdown, irrelevantly of the capacity of the fungus to mutate. These aspects should be considered while breeding for robust forms of resistance to blast disease.
24189714	Identification of QTLs with additive, epistatic and QTL × development interaction effects for seed dormancy in rice.	2014	Planta	Seed dormancy (SD) is an important agronomic trait affecting crop yield and quality. In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of SD at the early (4 weeks after heading), middle (5 weeks after heading) and late (6 weeks after heading) development stages. The level of SD decreased with the process of seed development, and the SD was significantly affected by the heading date (HD) and temperature at the early and middle development stages. A total of eight additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SD were identified at three development stages, and more QTLs were expressed at the early and late development stages. Among them, four, one and three additive QTLs were identified at the early, middle and late development stages, respectively. Epistatic QTLs and QTL-by-development interactions were detected by the joint analysis of multi-development phenotypic values, and one additive and two epistatic QTLs were identified. The phenotypic variation of SD explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL × development interaction ranged from 8.0 to 13.5 %, 0.7 to 3.9 % and 1.3 to 2.8 %, respectively. One major QTL qSD7.1 for SD was tightly linked to the major QTL qHD7.4 for HD, which might be applied to reveal the relationship of SD and HD. By comparing chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, five additive QTLs qSD1.1, qSD2.1, qSD2.2, qSD4.1 and qSD4.2 might represent novel genes. The best three cross combinations for the development of RIL populations were predicted to improve SD. The selected RILs and the identified QTLs might be applicable to improve the rice pre-harvest sprouting tolerance by the marker-assisted selection approach.
24237606	Inducible expression of a fusion gene encoding two proteinase inhibitors leads to insect and pathogen resistance in transgenic rice.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Plant proteinase inhibitors (PIs) are considered as candidates for increased insect resistance in transgenic plants. Insect adaptation to PI ingestion might, however, compromise the benefits received by transgenic expression of PIs. In this study, the maize proteinase inhibitor (MPI), an inhibitor of insect serine proteinases, and the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) were fused into a single open reading frame and introduced into rice plants. The two PIs were linked using either the processing site of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1B precursor protein or the 2A sequence from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Expression of each fusion gene was driven by the wound- and pathogen-inducible mpi promoter. The mpi-pci fusion gene was stably inherited for at least three generations with no penalty on plant phenotype. An important reduction in larval weight of Chilo suppressalis fed on mpi-pci rice, compared with larvae fed on wild-type plants, was observed. Expression of the mpi-pci fusion gene confers resistance to C. suppressalis (striped stem borer), one of the most important insect pest of rice. The mpi-pci expression systems described may represent a suitable strategy for insect pest control, better than strategies based on the use of single PI genes, by preventing insect adaptive responses. The rice plants expressing the mpi-pci fusion gene also showed enhanced resistance to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of the rice blast disease. Our results illustrate the usefulness of the inducible expression of the mpi-pci fusion gene for dual resistance against insects and pathogens in rice plants.
24200074	The periplasmic PDZ domain-containing protein Prc modulates full virulence, envelops stress responses, and directly interacts with dipeptidyl peptidase of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	PDZ domain-containing proteases, also known as HtrA family proteases, play important roles in bacterial cells by modulating disease pathogenesis and cell-envelope stress responses. These proteases have diverse functions through proteolysis- and nonproteolysis-dependent modes. Here, we report that the genome of the causative agent of rice bacterial blight, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, encodes seven PDZ domain-containing proteins. Systematic inactivation of their encoding genes revealed that PXO_01122 and PXO_04290 (prc) are involved in virulence. prc encodes a putative HtrA family protease that localizes in the bacterial periplasm. Mutation of prc also resulted in susceptibility to multiple environmental stresses, including H2O2, sodium dodecylsulfate, and osmolarity stresses. Comparative subproteomic analyses showed that the amounts of 34 periplasmic proteins were lower in the prc mutant than in wild-type. These proteins were associated with proteolysis, biosynthesis of macromolecules, carbohydrate or energy metabolism, signal transduction, and protein translocation or folding. We provide in vivo and in vitro evidence demonstrating that Prc stabilizes and directly binds to one of these proteins, DppP, a dipeptidyl peptidase contributing to full virulence. Taken together, our results suggest that Prc contributes to bacterial virulence by acting as a periplasmic modulator of cell-envelope stress responses.
24222495	Selection of a thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus strain with potential application for cellulosic ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	The development of technologies for cellulosic ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) depends on the use of microorganisms with high fermentative rates and thermotolerance. In this study, the ability of five Kluyveromyces marxianus strains to produce ethanol from glucose at 45 °C was investigated. The highest fermentative parameters were observed with K. marxianus NRRL Y-6860, which was then further studied. An initial evaluation of the oxygen supply on ethanol production by the selected yeast and a comparison of SSF process from acid pretreated rice straw between K. marxianus NRRL Y-6860 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 30 and 45 °C were carried out. Under the lowest evaluated conditions of aeration and agitation, K. marxianus NRRL Y-6860 produced 21.5 g/L ethanol from 51.3 g/L glucose corresponding to YP/S of 0.44 g/g and QP of 3.63 g/L h. In the SSF experiments, K. marxianus NRRL Y-6860 was more efficient than S. cerevisiae at both evaluated temperatures (30 and 45 °C), attained at the highest temperature an ethanol yield of 0.24 g/g and productivity of 1.44 g/L h.
24280309	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The mechanism of iron (Fe) uptake in plants has been extensively characterized, but little is known about how Fe transport to different subcellular compartments affects Fe localization in rice seed. Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization.

FINDINGS: osvit2 plants accumulated less Fe in their shoots when grown under normal or excess Fe conditions, while the accumulation of Fe was comparable to that in wild-type (WT) plants under Fe-deficient conditions. The accumulation of zinc, copper, and manganese also changed significantly in the shoots of osvit2 plants. The growth of osvit2 plants was also slow compared to that of WT plants. The concentration of Fe increased in osvit2 polished seeds. Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vacuolar Fe trafficking is important for plant Fe homeostasis and distribution, especially in plants grown in the presence of excess Fe. Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds.
24239268	Effect of agro-industrial waste amendment on Cd uptake in Amaranthus caudatus grown under contaminated soil: an oxidative biomarker response.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	In the present study phytoavailability of Cd, growth yield, cellular Cd accumulation and oxidative stress responses were studied in leafy vegetable Amaranthus caudatus under soil amendments. The test plant was cultivated in Cd contaminated soil (6 µgCdg(-1) soil) amended with different doses: 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 percent of rice husk (RH), saw dust (SD), farmyard manure (FYM), farmyard in combination with nitrogen, and phosphorus and potassium (FYM+NPK). Phytoavailability of Cd in amended soil and cellular Cd accumulation in edible parts (shoot) of A. caudatus declined maximally with 5 percent dose of each amendment, and decrease in Cd content in tissues was 36, 45, 23 and 14 percent under FYM, FYM+NPK, RH and SD amendments, respectively, over the value recorded in plants grown in Cd contaminated non-amended soil (Cd(+)NA soil). The shoot yield in control plant cultivated in the absence of Cd without amendment (Cd(-)NA soil) was 18.1 ± 0.98 gfwplant(-1) and it was declined up to 50 percent (9.2 ± 0.80 gfwplant(-1)) when plants were grown in Cd(+)NA soil. Amendments with 5 percent doses of FYM+NPK and FYM enhanced the yield up to 26.5 ± 0.57 and 20.5 ± 1.00 gfwplant(-1), respectively, which may be correlated with better mineral nutrients and organic carbon content in amended soil. RH and SD amendments with similar doses improved in yield up to 16.9 ± 0.43 and 15.2 ± 0.45 gfwplant(-1), respectively, however, it was still less than that of control. Further, correlation analysis of growth yield, Cd concentration and oxidative stress under these conditions suggest that with the decrease in cellular Cd concentration following amendment the level of oxidative markers (oxidants: O2(-) and H2O2 and lipid peroxidation: malondialdehyde; MDA) declined as a result of significant enhancement in the activity of enzymatic antioxidants (peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, dyhydroascorbe reductase and catalase). Thus, the present technique can efficiently reduce the metal load in food chain and also increase plant yield, hence it could be applied in catchments area of urban cities where metal contamination has become an unavoidable factor.
24206428	Rice sucrose transporter1 (OsSUT1) up-regulation in xylem parenchyma is caused by aphid feeding on rice leaf blade vascular bundles.	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	The role of the sucrose transporter OsSUT1 in assimilate retrieval via the xylem, as a result of damage to and leakage from punctured phloem was examined after rusty plum aphid (Hysteroneura setariae, Thomas) infestation on leaves from 3-week-old rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) plants. Leaves were examined over a 1- to 10-day infestation time course, using a combination of gene expression and β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene analyses. qPCR and Western blot analyses revealed differential expression of OsSUT1 during aphid infestation. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the expression of OsSUT1-promoter::GUS reporter gene in vascular parenchyma associated with xylem elements, as well as in companion cells associated with phloem sieve tubes of large, intermediate and small vascular bundles within the leaf blade, in regions where the aphids had settled and were feeding. Of great interest was up-regulation of OsSUT1 expression associated with the xylem parenchyma cells, abutting the metaxylem vessels, which confirmed that OsSUT1 was not only involved in loading of sugars into the phloem under normal physiological conditions, but was apparently involved in the retrieval of sucrose leaked into the xylem conduits, which occurred as a direct result of aphid feeding, probing and puncturing of vascular bundles. The up-regulation of OsSUT1 in xylem vascular parenchyma thus provides evidence in support of the location within the xylem parenchyma cells of an efficient mechanism to ensure sucrose recovery after loss to the apoplast (xylem) after aphid-related feeding damage and its transfer back to the symplast (phloem) in O. sativa leaves.

24151203	A mutable albino allele in rice reveals that formation of thylakoid membranes requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 gene.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Active DNA transposons are important tools for gene functional analysis. The endogenous non-autonomous transposon, nDart1-0, in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is expected to generate various transposon-insertion mutants because nDart1-0 elements tend to insert into genic regions under natural growth conditions. We have developed a specific method (nDart1-0-iPCR) for efficient detection of nDart1-0 insertions and successfully identified the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 (SWL1) gene in a variegated albino (swl1-v) mutant obtained from the nDart1-promoted rice tagging line. The variegated albino phenotype was caused by insertion and excision of nDart1-0 in the 5'-untranslated region of the SWL1 gene predicted to encode an unknown protein with the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. SWL1 expression was detected in various rice tissues at different developmental stages. However, immunoblot analysis indicated that SWL1 protein accumulation was strictly regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In the swl1 mutant, formations of grana and stroma thylakoids and prolamellar bodies were inhibited. This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development. Furthermore, we provide a developmental perspective on the nDart1-promoted tagging line to characterize unidentified gene functions in rice.
24226906	Diapause, signal and molecular characteristics of overwintering Chilo suppressalis (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	2013	Sci Rep	Diapause is a complex and dynamic process. Chilo suppressalis, an important rice pest in Asia enters facultative diapause as larvae. Our results demonstrated in Yangzhou, China, diapause was initiated between September 4 and 12, 2010. After diapause termination, C. suppressalis remained in quiescence in the field for as long as three months. The average time between collection of field larvae of C. suppressalis and their pupation decreased as the season progressed from fall to next spring. Unexpectedly, the pupated ratio of female to male in the initiation of diapause was 0.22. The abundance of hsp90, hsp70, hsp60 and CsAQP1 all peaked on January 8 or 15, 2011. Nitric oxide (NO) is a secondary messenger that is positively correlated with the diapause of C. suppressalis. Among several geographically separated populations of C. suppressalis, there are no significant differences in the mRNA levels of hsp70, hsp60 or CsAQP1.
24286630	The broad bacterial blight resistance of rice line CBB23 is triggered by a novel transcription activator-like (TAL) effector of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	Bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is not only a disease devastating rice production worldwide, but also an ideal model system for the study of the interaction between plants and their bacterial pathogens. The rice near-isogenic line (NIL) CBB23, derived from a cross between a wild rice Oryza rufipogon accession (RBB16) and a susceptible indica rice variety (Jingang 30), is highly resistant to all field Xoo strains tested so far. Although the BB resistance of CBB23 has been widely used in rice breeding programmes, the mechanism of its extremely broad-spectrum resistance remains unknown. Here, we report the molecular cloning of an avirulence gene, designated as avrXa23, from Xoo strain PXO99(A) . We validate that AvrXa23, a novel transcription activator-like effector, specifically triggers the broad-spectrum BB resistance in CBB23. The prevalence of avrXa23 in all 38 Xoo strains surveyed may explain the broad-spectrum feature of BB resistance in CBB23. The results will significantly facilitate the molecular cloning of the corresponding resistance (R) gene in the host, and provide new insights into our understanding of the molecular mechanism for broad-spectrum disease resistance in plants.
24273057	Confined nanospace pyrolysis for the fabrication of coaxial Fe3O4@C hollow particles with a penetrated mesochannel as a superior anode for Li-ion batteries.	2014	Chemistry	In this study, a method is developed to fabricate Fe3O4@C particles with a coaxial and penetrated hollow mesochannel based on the concept of "confined nanospace pyrolysis". The synthesis involves the production of a polydopamine coating followed by a silica coating on a rod-shaped β-FeOOH nanoparticle, and subsequent treatment by using confined nanospace pyrolysis and silica removal procedures. Typical coaxial hollow Fe3O4@C possesses a rice-grain morphology and mesoporous structure with a large specific surface area, as well as a continuous and flexible carbon shell. Electrochemical tests reveal that the hollow Fe3O4@C with an open-ended nanostructure delivers a high specific capacity (ca. 864 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), excellent rate capability with a capacity of about 582 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1), and a high Coulombic efficiency (>97%). The excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the hollow cavity with an inner diameter of 18 nm and a flexible carbon shell that can accommodate the volume change of the Fe3O4 during the lithium insertion/extraction processes as well as the large specific surface area and open inner cavity to facilitate the rapid diffusion of lithium ions from electrolyte to active material. This fabrication strategy can be used to generate a hollow or porous metal oxide structure for high-performance Li-ion batteries.
24279397	Analysis of the transcriptome of Hirschmanniella oryzae to explore potential survival strategies and host-nematode interactions.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	The rice root nematode Hirschmanniella oryzae is the most abundant plant-parasitic nematode in flooded rice fields and is distributed world-wide. Although it is economically less important than sedentary nematodes, it can cause severe yield reductions and economic losses in specific environmental conditions. No transcriptome data for this genus were available until now. We have performed 454 sequencing on a mixed life stages population to gain an insight into nematode-plant interactions and nematode survival strategies. The results of two assembly strategies were combined to reduce the redundancy of the data, generating a final dataset of 21 360 contigs. The data were screened for putative plant cell wall-modifying proteins, which facilitate nematode migration through host roots. A β-mannanase, previously not reported in nematodes, was detected in the dataset. The data were screened for putative effector proteins that may alter the host defence mechanism. Two enzymes, chorismate mutase and isochorismatase, thought to be involved in the salicyclic acid pathway, were identified. Experimental treatments of H. oryzae with artificial seawater showed that late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and SXP/RAL-2 are induced, suggesting that these proteins are involved in the process of anhydrobiosis. The newly generated data can highlight potential differences between sedentary and migratory nematodes, and will be useful in the further study of host-nematode interactions and the developmental biology of this nematode.
24265778	A seed preferential heat shock transcription factor from wheat provides abiotic stress tolerance and yield enhancement in transgenic Arabidopsis under heat stress environment.	2013	PLoS One	Reduction in crop yield and quality due to various abiotic stresses is a worldwide phenomenon. In the present investigation, a heat shock factor (HSF) gene expressing preferentially in developing seed tissues of wheat grown under high temperatures was cloned. This newly identified heat shock factor possesses the characteristic domains of class A type plant HSFs and shows high similarity to rice OsHsfA2d, hence named as TaHsfA2d. The transcription factor activity of TaHsfA2d was confirmed through transactivation assay in yeast. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d not only possess higher tolerance towards high temperature but also showed considerable tolerance to salinity and drought stresses, they also showed higher yield and biomass accumulation under constant heat stress conditions. Analysis of putative target genes of AtHSFA2 through quantitative RT-PCR showed higher and constitutive expression of several abiotic stress responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing TaHsfA2d. Under stress conditions, TaHsfA2d can also functionally complement the T-DNA insertion mutants of AtHsfA2, although partially. These observations suggest that TaHsfA2d may be useful in molecular breeding of crop plants, especially wheat, to improve yield under abiotic stress conditions.
24279904	A randomized controlled trial investigating the neurocognitive effects of Lacprodan® PL-20, a phospholipid-rich milk protein concentrate, in elderly participants with age-associated memory impairment: the Phospholipid Intervention for Cognitive Ageing Reversal (PLICAR): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	2013	Trials	BACKGROUND: Age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) is of major societal concern in an ageing population, with the development of dietary supplements providing a promising avenue for amelioration of associated deficits. Despite initial interest in the use of phospholipids (PLs) for ARCD, in recent years there has been a hiatus in such research. Because of safety concerns regarding PLs derived from bovine cortex, and the equivocal efficacy of soybean-derived PLs, there is an important need for the development of new PL alternatives. Phospholipids derived from milk proteins represent one potential candidate treatment.

METHODS: In order to reduce the effects of age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) the Phospholipid Intervention for Cognitive Ageing Reversal (PLICAR) was developed to test the efficacy of a milk protein concentrate rich in natural, non-synthetic milk phospholipids (Lacprodan® PL-20). PLICAR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-groups study where 150 (N = 50/group) AAMI participants aged > 55 years will be randomized to receive a daily supplement of Lacprodan® PL-20 or one of two placebos (phospholipid-free milk protein concentrate or inert rice starch) over a 6-month (180-day) period. Participants will undergo testing at baseline, 90 days and 180 days. The primary outcome is a composite memory score from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive (verbal learning, working memory, prospective and retrospective memory, processing speed and attention), mood (depression, anxiety, stress and visual analogue scales), cardiovascular (blood pressure, blood velocity and pulse wave pressure), gastrointestinal microbiota and biochemical measures (oxidative stress, inflammation, B vitamins and Homocysteine, glucoregulation and serum choline). Allelic differences in the Apolipoprotein E and (APOE) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene will be included for subgroup analysis. A subset (N = 60; 20/group)) will undergo neuroimaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in order to further explore in vivo central mechanisms of action of Lacprodan® PL-20. This study will enable evaluation of the efficacy of milk-derived phospholipids for AAMI, and their mechanisms of action.

TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is jointly funded by Arla Foods and Swinburne University of Technology, currently recruiting and is registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12613000347763.
24262840	Evaluation of hydrothermal treatment in enhancing rice straw compost stability and maturity.	2014	Bioresour Technol	In order to evaluate the hydrothermal treatment (HTT) in enhancing compost stability and maturity of lignocellulosic agricultural residues, a bin-scale (90 L) composting of rice straw with and without "HTT" was performed. The rice straw compost product with "HTT" after 6 weeks of composting can be considered stable and adequate for field application as expressed by pH of 8.4, "EC value" of 2.96 dS m(-1), C/N ratio of 12.5, microbial activity of <8.05 mg CO2 g(-1) OM d(-1), NH4(+)-N content of 93.75 mg kg(-1) DM and finally, by "GI" of >83%. However, compost may prove phytotoxic if used as growing media for EC sensitive plants. As for rice straw compost product without "HTT", the high microbial activity (>12.28 mg CO2 g(-1) OM d(-1)) even after 14 weeks of composting suggests that the residue has not stabilized yet and is far away from stability and maturity, although a higher GI (>100%) was observed.
24121292	A high-density SNP genotyping array for rice biology and molecular breeding.	2014	Mol Plant	A high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array is critically important for geneticists and molecular breeders. With the accumulation of huge amounts of genomic re-sequencing data and available technologies for accurate SNP detection, it is possible to design high-density and high-quality rice SNP arrays. Here we report the development of a high-density rice SNP array and its utility. SNP probes were designed by screening more than 10 000 000 SNP loci extracted from the re-sequencing data of 801 rice varieties and an array named RiceSNP50 was produced on the Illumina Infinium platform. The array contained 51 478 evenly distributed markers, 68% of which were within genic regions. Several hundred rice plants with parent/F1 relationships were used to generate a high-quality cluster file for accurate SNP calling. Application tests showed that this array had high genotyping accuracy, and could be used for different objectives. For example, a core collection of elite rice varieties was clustered with fine resolution. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis correctly identified a characterized QTL. Further, this array was successfully used for variety verification and trait introgression. As an accurate high-throughput genotyping tool, RiceSNP50 will play an important role in both functional genomics studies and molecular breeding.
24211267	Amylopectin is the anti-fatigue ingredient in glutinous rice.	2014	Int J Biol Macromol	The anti-fatigue activities of glutinous rice (GR) and GR amylopectin (GRA) were investigated in mice by determining tissue glycogen, blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) after the weight loaded forced swim test (WFST). GR and GRA were given by gavage at various doses of GR (7.5, 15, 30 g/kg body weight) and GRA (3.8, 7.5, 15 g/kg body weight) every day for 7 days, respectively. The results indicated that the hepatic glycogen levels significantly (P<0.05) increased 26-44% and 35-60% and the muscle glycogen levels significantly (P<0.05) increased 36-100% and 67-133% in GR and GRA treatment groups, compared with the negative control group. The GRA treatment groups also had significantly (P<0.05) higher (9.1-20.3%) blood LDH levels. Meanwhile, the blood LDH activities in GR and GRA treatment groups had a significantly positive correlation with the hepatic glycogen levels (r=0.978, P<0.01). Moreover, except of the low-dose GR (7.5 g/kg body weight) supplemented group, mice in all other treatment groups had significantly (P<0.05) lower (13-23%) BUN levels. Compared with the GR treatment groups, GRA treatment groups had similar or even higher anti-fatigue activities, which demonstrated that GRA might play the most important role on the anti-fatigue activities for GR.
24287529	Comparability of red/near-infrared reflectance and NDVI based on the spectral response function between MODIS and 30 other satellite sensors using rice canopy spectra.	2013	Sensors (Basel)	Long-term monitoring of regional and global environment changes often depends on the combined use of multi-source sensor data. The most widely used vegetation index is the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a function of the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands. The reflectance and NDVI data sets derived from different satellite sensor systems will not be directly comparable due to different spectral response functions (SRF), which has been recognized as one of the most important sources of uncertainty in the multi-sensor data analysis. This study quantified the influence of SRFs on the red and NIR reflectances and NDVI derived from 31 Earth observation satellite sensors. For this purpose, spectroradiometric measurements were performed for paddy rice grown under varied nitrogen levels and at different growth stages. The rice canopy reflectances were convoluted with the spectral response functions of various satellite instruments to simulate sensor-specific reflectances in the red and NIR channels. NDVI values were then calculated using the simulated red and NIR reflectances. The results showed that as compared to the Terra MODIS, the mean relative percentage difference (RPD) ranged from -12.67% to 36.30% for the red reflectance, -8.52% to -0.23% for the NIR reflectance, and -9.32% to 3.10% for the NDVI. The mean absolute percentage difference (APD) compared to the Terra MODIS ranged from 1.28% to 36.30% for the red reflectance, 0.84% to 8.71% for the NIR reflectance, and 0.59% to 9.32% for the NDVI. The lowest APD between MODIS and the other 30 satellite sensors was observed for Landsat5 TM for the red reflectance, CBERS02B CCD for the NIR reflectance and Landsat4 TM for the NDVI. In addition, the largest APD between MODIS and the other 30 satellite sensors was observed for IKONOS for the red reflectance, AVHRR1 onboard NOAA8 for the NIR reflectance and IKONOS for the NDVI. The results also indicated that AVHRRs onboard NOAA7-17 showed higher differences than did the other sensors with respect to MODIS. A series of optimum models were presented for remote sensing data assimilation between MODIS and other sensors.
24285580	G-protein-coupled receptor 91 and succinate are key contributors in neonatal postcerebral hypoxia-ischemia recovery.	2014	Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol	OBJECTIVE: Prompt post-hypoxia-ischemia (HI) revascularization has been suggested to improve outcome in adults and newborn subjects. Other than hypoxia-inducible factor, sensors of metabolic demand remain largely unknown. During HI, anaerobic respiration is arrested resulting in accumulation of carbohydrate metabolic intermediates. As such succinate readily increases, exerting its biological effects via a specific receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 91. We postulate that succinate/GPR91 enhances post-HI vascularization and reduces infarct size in a model of newborn HI brain injury.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: The Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI was used. Succinate was measured by mass spectrometry, and microvascular density was evaluated by quantification of lectin-stained cryosection. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Succinate levels rapidly increased in the penumbral region of brain infarcts. GPR91 was foremost localized not only in neurons but also in astrocytes. Microvascular density increased at 96 hours after injury in wild-type animals; it was diminished in GPR91-null mice leading to an increased infarct size. Stimulation with succinate led to an increase in growth factors implicated in angiogenesis only in wild-type mice. To explain the mode of action of succinate/GPR91, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4, previously proposed in neural angiogenesis. Succinate-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression was abrogated by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a selective prostaglandin E receptor 4 antagonist. This antagonist also abolished succinate-induced neovascularization.

CONCLUSIONS: We uncover a dominant metabolic sensor responsible for post-HI neurovascular adaptation, notably succinate/GPR91, acting via prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4 to govern expression of major angiogenic factors. We propose that pharmacological intervention targeting GPR91 could improve post-HI brain recovery.
24275941	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene family from banana suggest involvement of specific members in different stages of fruit ripening.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important components of the tripartite mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade and play an important role in plant growth and development. Although members of the MAPK gene family have been identified in model plants, little information is available regarding this gene family in fruit crops. In this study, we carried out a computational analysis using the Musa Genome database to identify members of the MAPK gene family in banana, an economically important crop and the most popular fruit worldwide. Our analysis identified 25 members of the MAP kinase (MAPK or MPK) gene family. Phylogenetic analyses of MPKs in Arabidopsis, Oryza, and Populus have classified these MPKs into four subgroups. The presence of conserved domains in the deduced amino acid sequences, phylogeny, and genomic organization strongly support their identity as members of the MPK gene family. Expression analysis during ethylene-induced banana fruit ripening suggests the involvement of several MPKs in the ethylene signal transduction pathway that are necessary for banana fruit ripening. Analysis of the cis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions and the involvement of the identified MPKs in various cellular processes, as analyzed using Pathway Studio, suggest a role for the banana MPK gene family in diverse functions related to growth, development, and the stress response. This report is the first concerning the identification of members of a gene family and the elucidation of their role in various processes using the Musa Genome database.
24220337	Identification of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase gene family and MKK-MAPK interaction network in maize.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Plant mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in important processes, including stress signaling and development. MAPK kinases (MAPKK, MKK) have been investigated in several plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, and Brachypodium distachyon. In the present study, nine putative maize MKK genes have been identified. Analysis of the conserved protein motifs, exon-intron junctions and intron phase has revealed high levels of conservation within the phylogenetic groups. Next, we defined four new ZmMKK-ZmMPK interactions using yeast two-hybrid. Finally, we examined the biological functions of the ZmMKK4 gene. Overexpression of ZmMKK4 in Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to oxidative stress by increased germination rate and early seedling growth compared with WT plants. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the MKK gene family in maize genome and our data provide an important foundation for further functional study of MAPK and MKK families in maize.
24259682	Diurnal and developmental changes in energy allocation of absorbed light at PSII in field-grown rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	The allocation of absorbed light energy in PSII to electron transport and heat dissipation processes in rice grown under waterlogged conditions was estimated with the lake model of energy transfer. With regard to diurnal changes in energy allocation, the peak of the energy flux to electron transport, J(PSII), occurred in the morning and the peak of the energy flux to heat dissipation associated with non-photochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence, J(NPQ), occurred in the afternoon. With regard to seasonal changes in energy allocation, J(PSII) in the rapidly growing phase was greater than that in the ripening phase, even though the leaves of rice receive less light in the growing phase than in the ripening period in Japan. This seasonal decrease in J(PSII) was accompanied by an increase in J(NPQ). One of the reasons for the lower J(PSII) in the ripening phase might be a more sever afternoon suppression of J(PSII). To estimate energy dissipation due to photoinhibition of PSII, J(NPQ) was divided into J(fast), which is associated with fast-recovering NPQ mainly due to qE, and J(slow), which is mainly due to photoinhibition. The integrated daily energy loss by photoinhibiton was calculated to be about 3-8% of light energy absorption in PSII. Strategies for the utilization of light energy adopted by rice are discussed. For example, very efficient photosynthesis under non-saturating light in the rapidly growing phase is proposed.
24270018	Susceptibility of various Japanese freshwater fish species to an isolate of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb.	2013	Dis Aquat Organ	Genotype IVb of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was isolated for the first time in the Great Lakes basin in 2003, where it spread and caused mass mortalities in several wild fish species throughout the basin. In order to prevent further spreading of the disease and to assess risks of new genotypes invading new watersheds, basic microbiological information such as pathogenicity studies are essential. In this study, experimental infections were conducted on 7 indigenous freshwater fish species from Japan by immersion with a VHSV genotype IVb isolate. In Expt 1, cumulative mortalities in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus used as positive controls, Japanese fluvial sculpin Cottus pollux, and iwana Salvelinus leucomaenis pluvius were 50, 80 and 0%, respectively. In Expt 2, cumulative mortalities of 100, 100 and 10% were observed in Japanese fluvial sculpin C. pollux, Japanese rice fish Oryzias latipes and yoshinobori Rhinogobius sp., respectively. No mortality was observed in honmoroko Gnathopogon caerulescens, akaza Liobagrus reini or Japanese striped loach Cobitis biwae. VHSV was detected by RT-PCR from samples of kidney, spleen, and brain from all dead fish, and virus re-isolation by cell culture was successful from all dead fish. We detected the virus in the brain from a few surviving bluegill 50 d post exposure by both cell culture and RT-PCR. These results revealed that VHSV IVb could become a serious threat to wild freshwater fish species in Japan, and that some surviving fish might become healthy carriers of the virus.
24240781	Major QTLs control resistance to rice hoja blanca virus and its vector Tagosodes orizicolus.	2014	G3 (Bethesda)	Rice hoja blanca (white leaf) disease can cause severe yield losses in rice in the Americas. The disease is caused by the rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), which is transmitted by the planthopper vector Tagosodes orizicolus. Because classical breeding schemes for this disease rely on expensive, time-consuming screenings, there is a need for alternatives such as marker-aided selection. The varieties Fedearroz 2000 and Fedearroz 50, which are resistant to RHBV and to the feeding damage caused by T. orizicolus, were crossed with the susceptible line WC366 to produce segregating F2:3 populations. The F3 families were scored for their resistance level to RHBV and T. orizicolus. The F2:3 lines of both crosses were genotyped using microsatellite markers. One major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 4 was identified for resistance to RHBV in the two populations. Two major QTL on chromosomes 5 and 7 were identified for resistance to T. orizicolus in the Fd2000 × WC366 and Fd50 × WC366 crosses, respectively. This comparative study using two distinct rice populations allowed for a better understanding of how the resistance to RHBV and its vector are controlled genetically. Simple marker-aided breeding schemes based on QTL information can be designed to improve rice germplasm to reduce losses caused by this important disease.
23907589	Germinated brown rice extract inhibits adipogenesis through the down-regulation of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	2013	Plant Foods Hum Nutr	The aim of this study was to examine the anti-adipogenic effect of germinated brown rice methanol extract (GBR) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The GBR inhibited adipocyte differentiation was measured by Oil Red O staining and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity in a dose-dependent manner without initiating any cytotoxicity. The mRNA levels of adipogenic transcription factors such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα), proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and adipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), were significantly down-regulated by treatment with GBR when compared to that of untreated control cells. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expressions were attenuated by GBR in mature adipocytes. These data suggest that GBR exhibits an anti-adipogenic effect through the suppression of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
24064300	Cell dispersion culture for the effective growth of Humicola insolens and efficient enzyme production.	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	We have developed a method for the effective growth of Humicola insolens conducive to efficient enzyme production using a medium containing glucose as a carbon source and extruded soybean meal (ExSBM) as a nitrogen source. Enzymes from Humicola sp. hold promise for biomass degradation, especially of lignocellulosic materials such as rice straw, wood chips, and corn stover. The strain, however, is hard to disperse, so an aggregated form of the fungus in a liquid culture media is generally used, resulting in poor control of the growth process and low enzyme production. This has greatly limited the utilization of this strain, in spite of its potential as an enzyme producer. Surprisingly, the addition of ExSBM improves mycelium dispersion and enzyme production of H. insolens, and the dispersive effect is applicable to other fungi such as Trichoderma and Aspergillus sp. In contrast, defatted soybean meal not treated with an extrusion process has little effect on mycelium cohesion. It therefore appears that the specific three-dimensional structure of ExSBM arising from the extrusion process provides a favorable environment for cell growth, since the composition of ExSBM and soybean meal is essentially identical. The optimum medium for cell dispersion culture essentially consisted of 5% glucose and 0.3% ExSBM.
24058573	Genomewide variation in an introgression line of rice-Zizania revealed by whole-genome re-sequencing.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Hybridization between genetically diverged organisms is known as an important avenue that drives plant genome evolution. The possible outcomes of hybridization would be the occurrences of genetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids. It remained under-investigated however whether pollination by alien pollens of a closely related but sexually "incompatible" species could evoke genomic changes and to what extent it may result in phenotypic novelties in the derived progenies.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we have re-sequenced the genomes of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Matsumae and one of its derived introgressant RZ35 that was obtained from an introgressive hybridization between Matsumae and Zizanialatifolia Griseb. in general, 131 millions 90 base pair (bp) paired-end reads were generated which covered 13.2 and 21.9 folds of the Matsumae and RZ35 genomes, respectively. Relative to Matsumae, a total of 41,724 homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 17,839 homozygous insertions/deletions (indels) were identified in RZ35, of which 3,797 SNPs were nonsynonymous mutations. Furthermore, rampant mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) was found in the RZ35 genome. The results of pathogen inoculation revealed that RZ35 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast relative to Matsumae. Notably, one nonsynonymous mutation was found in the known blast resistance gene Pid3/Pi25 and real-time quantitative (q) RT-PCR analysis revealed constitutive up-regulation of its expression, suggesting both altered function and expression of Pid3/Pi25 may be responsible for the enhanced resistance to rice blast by RZ35.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that introgressive hybridization by Zizania has provoked genomewide, extensive genomic changes in the rice genome, and some of which have resulted in important phenotypic novelties. These findings suggest that introgressive hybridization by alien pollens of even a sexually incompatible species may represent a potent means to generate novel genetic diversities, and which may have played relevant roles in plant evolution and can be manipulated for crop improvements.
24058171	Bidirectional-genetics platform, a dual-purpose mutagenesis strategy for filamentous fungi.	2013	Eukaryot Cell	Rapidly increasing fungal genome sequences call for efficient ways of generating mutants to translate quickly gene sequences into their functions. A reverse genetic strategy via targeted gene replacement (TGR) has been inefficient for many filamentous fungi due to dominant production of undesirable ectopic transformants. Although large-scale random insertional mutagenesis via transformation (i.e., forward genetics) facilitates high-throughput uncovering of novel genes of interest, generating a huge number of transformants, which is necessary to ensure the likelihood of mutagenizing most genes, is time-consuming. We propose a new strategy, entitled the Bidirectional-Genetics (BiG) platform, which combines both forward and reverse genetic strategies by recycling ectopic transformants derived from TGR as a source for random insertional mutants. The BiG platform was evaluated using the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae as a model. Over 10% of >1,000 M. oryzae ectopic transformants, generated during disruption of specific genes, displayed abnormality in vegetative growth, pigmentation, and/or asexual reproduction. In this pool of putative mutants, we isolated insertional mutants with mutations in three genes involved in histidine biosynthesis (MoHIS5), vegetative growth (MoVPS74), or conidiophore formation (MoFRQ) (where "Mo" indicates "M. oryzae"), supporting the utility of this platform for systematic gene function studies.
24058362	Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus: a white-backed planthopper-transmitted fijivirus threatening rice production in Asia.	2013	Front Microbiol	Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments, is a novel species in the genus Fijivirus (family Reoviridae) first recognized in 2008. Rice plants infected with this virus exhibit symptoms similar to those caused by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus. Since 2009, the virus has rapidly spread and caused serious rice losses in East and Southeast Asia. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding this disease, especially about the functions of the viral genes, rice-virus-insect interactions, and epidemiology and control measures. The virus can be efficiently transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) in a persistent circulative propagative manner but cannot be transmitted by the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus). Rice, maize, Chinese sorghum (Coix lacryma-jobi) and other grass weeds can be infected via WBPH. However, only rice plays a major role in the virus infection cycle because of the vector's preference. In Southeast Asia, WBPH is a long-distance migratory rice pest. The disease cycle can be described as follows: SRBSDV and its WBPH vector overwinter in warm tropical or sub-tropical areas; viruliferous WBPH adults carry the virus from south to north via long-distance migration in early spring, transmit the virus to rice seedlings in the newly colonized areas, and lay eggs on the infected seedlings; the next generation of WBPHs propagate on infected seedlings, become viruliferous, disperse, and cause new disease outbreaks. Several molecular and serological methods have been developed to detect SRBSDV in plant tissues and individual insects. Control measures based on protection from WBPH, including seedbed coverage, chemical seed treatments, and chemical spraying of seedlings, have proven effective in China.

9106509	Characterization of the gene for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and correlation between the expression of the gene and salt tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) synthetase (cOsP5CS), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of proline, was isolated and characterized from a cDNA library prepared from 14-day-old seedlings of Oryza sativa cv. Akibare. The deduced amino acid sequence of the P5CS protein (OsP5CS) from O. sativa exhibited 74.2% and 75.5% homology to that of the P5CS from Arabidopsis thaliana and Vigna aconitifolia, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene for P5CS (OsP5CS) was induced by high salt, dehydration, treatment of ABA and cold treatment, while it was not induced by heat treatment. Simultaneously, accumulation of proline was observed as a result of high salt treatment in O. sativa. Moreover, the levels of expression of OsP5CS mRNA and content of proline under salt stress condition were compared between a salt-tolerant cultivar, Dee-gee-woo-gen (DGWG) and a salt-sensitive breeding line, IR28. It was observed that the expression of the P5CS gene and the accumulation of proline in DGWG steadily increased, whereas those in IR28 increased slightly.
10945345	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding proline transporter in rice.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	A cDNA encoding a proline (Pro) transporter (ProT) was isolated and characterized from a cDNA library prepared from 14-d-old seedlings of Oryza sativa cv. Akibare. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice ProT protein (OsProT) had 68.8% homology to the ProT protein 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and 59.6% homology to that from Lycopersicon esculentum. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene for OsProT (OsProT) was expressed in all organs examined, comparatively strongly in leaf sheath and stem. Salt treatment did not induce expression of OsProT but strongly induced expression of the gene for delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), a key enzyme in Pro biosynthesis. Southern blot analysis revealed that OsProT has a gene family. OsProT specifically transported L-Pro in a transport assay using Xenopus laevis oocytes.
14530400	A complex history of rearrangement in an orthologous region of the maize, sorghum, and rice genomes.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The sequences of large insert clones containing genomic DNA that is orthologous to the maize adh1 region were obtained for sorghum, rice, and the adh1-homoeologous region of maize, a remnant of the tetraploid history of the Zea lineage. By using all four genomes, it was possible to describe the nature, timing, and lineages of most of the genic rearrangements that have differentiated this chromosome segment over the last 60 million years. The rice genome has been the most stable, sharing 11 orthologous genes with sorghum and exhibiting only one tandem duplication of a gene in this region. The lineage that gave rise to sorghum and maize acquired a two-gene insertion (containing the adh locus), whereas sorghum received two additional gene insertions after its divergence from a common ancestor with maize. The two homoeologous regions of maize have been particularly unstable, with complete or partial deletion of three genes from one segment and four genes from the other segment. As a result, the region now contains only one duplicated locus compared with the eight original loci that were present in each diploid progenitor. Deletion of these maize genes did not remove both copies of any locus. This study suggests that grass genomes are generally unstable in local genome organization and gene content, but that some lineages are much more unstable than others. Maize, probably because of its polyploid origin, has exhibited extensive gene loss so that it is now approaching a diploid state.
15310079	A distinctive class of spermidine synthase is involved in chilling response in rice.	2004	J Plant Physiol	A cDNA for a putative 42 kD spermidine synthase (OsSPDS2) was cloned from rice. The deduced OsSPDS2 sequence showed highest similarity with Arabidopsis AtSPDS3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPDS2 and AtSPDS3 form a distinctive subclass in the spermidine synthase family in plants. OsSPDS2 mRNA accumulated in roots during long term exposure to chilling temperature (12 degrees C). In contrast, no such induction of the paralogous OsSPDS1 was observed during the chilling treatment. ABA treatment up-regulated OsSPDS2, whereas salt stress did not change OsSPDS2 levels significantly. Data suggested a distinct function of OsSPDS2 in chilling response in rice.
9278162	Characterization of the gene for pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase from rice, a C3 plant, and a comparison of structure and expression between C3 and C4 genes for this protein.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	To investigate the molecular changes that might have occurred in genes for pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) during the evolution of C4 plants from C3 plants, we isolated a full-length cDNA and the corresponding gene for a C4-like PPDK from rice, a C3 gramineous plant and compared their structures and promoter activities to those of the corresponding gene from maize, a C4 gramineous plant. As in maize, there are at least two ppdk genes in rice and one of them was very similar to the maize C4-type ppdk. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice PPDK was 88% homologous to the maize C4-type PPDK in the mature peptide region and 56% homologous in the transit peptide region. The C4-like ppdk in rice contained 21 exons, which were interrupted by twenty introns, and the positions of the introns were essentially the same as those in the gene from maize, with the except in that the gene from rice had two extra introns. Such extra introns were also found in the C4-type ppdk from a dicot, Flaveria, at the same positions. These results strongly suggest that the two introns were present in an ancestral gene before the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. The C4-like ppdk in rice contained two functionally independent promoters had generated a larger transcript with the transit peptide region and a smaller transcript without this region. The unusual dual-promoter system for transcription has been conserved in the C4-type ppdk gene from maize, indicating that the dual-promoter system is a common feature of ppdk genes in both C3 and C4 plants. The patterns of expression of the two transcripts in rice were different: the larger transcript was expressed exclusively in green leaves at a low level whereas the smaller transcript was expressed in some reproductive organs at a high level. Essentially the same patterns of expression were observed in maize, but the level of expression of the larger transcript in maize green leaves was much higher than that in green leaves of rice. The promoter activities of the rice and maize genes for PPDK were examined directly in a transient expression assay in maize mesophyll protoplasts after electroporation with promoter::beta-glucuronidase chimeric genes. The rice promoter for the smaller transcript was very active in the protoplasts but the rice promoter for the larger transcript had relatively low activity. By contrast, both promoters of the maize gene had high activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the rice C4-like ppdk is very similar to the maize C4-type ppdk, not only in terms of primary structure but also in terms of the regulation of expression, with the exception that the strength of the maize promoter for the larger transcript is higher. The results strongly suggest that the genetic alterations required to give rise to the C4-type ppdk gene were relatively limited.
15829602	Crown rootless1, which is essential for crown root formation in rice, is a target of an AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR in auxin signaling.	2005	Plant Cell	Although the importance of auxin in root development is well known, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown. We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in crown root formation, crown rootless1 (crl1). The crl1 mutant showed additional auxin-related abnormal phenotypic traits in the roots, such as decreased lateral root number, auxin insensitivity in lateral root formation, and impaired root gravitropism, whereas no abnormal phenotypic traits were observed in aboveground organs. Expression of Crl1, which encodes a member of the plant-specific ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES protein family, was localized in tissues where crown and lateral roots are initiated and overlapped with beta-glucuronidase staining controlled by the DR5 promoter. Exogenous auxin treatment induced Crl1 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, and this induction required the degradation of AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID proteins. Crl1 contains two putative auxin response elements (AuxREs) in its promoter region. The proximal AuxRE specifically interacted with a rice AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and acted as a cis-motif for Crl1 expression. We conclude that Crl1 encodes a positive regulator for crown and lateral root formation and that its expression is directly regulated by an ARF in the auxin signaling pathway.
11470540	Two types of replication protein A 70 kDa subunit in rice, Oryza sativa: molecular cloning, characterization, and cellular &amp; tissue distribution.	2001	Gene	Replication protein A (RPA), which is comprised of three subunits, is an important factor involved in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. We isolated and characterized 70 and 32 kDa subunits of RPA from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) termed OsRPA70a and OsRPA32. OsRPA70a shows a low level of homology with OsRPA1 which was isolated from deepwater rice (Oryza sativa cv. Pin Gaew 56), previously. We also succeeded to isolate OsRPA70b which is homologue to OsRPA1 from Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. OsRPA70a shows only 33.8% sequence identity with OsRPA70b, indicating that two different types of 70 kDa RPA subunits are present in Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. These subunits showed differences in their expression patterns among tissues. The transcripts of OsRPA70a and OsRPA32 were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively, and weakly in the mature leaves which have no proliferating tissues. On the other hand, OsRPA70b was expressed mostly in the proliferating tissues. The roles of these molecules in plant DNA replication and DNA repair are discussed.
12711392	Rice UV-damaged DNA binding protein homologues are most abundant in proliferating tissues.	2003	Gene	Ultraviolet-damaged DNA binding protein (UV-DDB) is an important factor involved in DNA repair. To study the role of UV-DDB, we attempted to obtain the cDNA and the protein of a plant UV-DDB. We succeeded in isolating both genes for UV-DDB subunits from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare), designated as OsUV-DDB1 and OsUV-DDB2. OsUV-DDB2 (65 kDa) was much larger than human UV-DDB2, but immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assay suggested that OsUV-DDB2 is a plant counterpart of UV-DDB2. The transcripts were expressed in proliferating tissues such as the meristem, but were detected at only low levels in the mature leaves, although the leaves are strongly exposed to UV. These transcripts were induced in the meristem after UV-irradiation. The expression levels of OsUV-DDB were significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted. These results indicated that the level of OsUV-DDB expression is correlated with cell proliferation, and its expression may be required mostly for DNA repair in DNA replication.
15978034	Two types of replication protein A in seed plants.	2005	FEBS J	Replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimeric protein composed of 70, 32 and 14-kDa subunits, has been shown to be essential for DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. Previously, we found that, in two seed plants, rice and Arabidopsis, there are two different types of RPA70-kDa subunit. Substantial biochemical and genetic characterization of these two subunits, termed OsRPA70a and OsRPA70b or AtRPA70a and AtRPA70b, respectively, is described in this report. Inactivation of AtRPA70a by transfer DNA insertion or RNA interference is lethal, so the complex containing RPA70a may be essential for DNA replication. Transfer DNA insertion and RNAi lines for AtRPA70b are morphologically normal, albeit hypersensitive to certain mutagens, such as UV-B and methyl methanesulfonate, suggesting that RPA70b functions mostly in DNA repair. In two-hybrid, pull-down and coexpression analysis, OsRPA70b was found to interact more selectively than OsRPA70a with OsRPA32. The data suggest that two different types of RPA heterotrimer are present in seed plants, and that there may be additional 32 and 14-kDa subunit homologs that interact with OsRPA70a. Each of the two probable plant RPA complexes may have different roles in DNA metabolism.
16140596	Higher plant RecA-like protein is homologous to RadA.	2006	DNA Repair (Amst)	A novel RecA-like protein, differing from Dmc1 and Rad51, was characterized in Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare. Because the protein is homologous to bacterial RadA, the gene was designated OsRadA. The open reading frame was predicted to encode a 66kDa protein of 619 amino acid residues and was found in plants but not animals or yeast. OsRadA showed D-loop and single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activities. Gene expression was found to be high in meristematic tissues, and was localized in the nucleus. An RNAi mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana RadA (AtRadA) was sensitive to mutagenic agents such as UV and MMC, suggesting that RadA functions in DNA repair.
7767602	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA for the alpha subunit of a G protein from rice.	1995	Plant Cell Physiol	We report the isolation of a cDNA for the alpha subunit of a G protein from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The cDNA contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 380 amino acid residues with a mol wt of 44,204. We designated this polypeptide RGA1 (rice G protein alpha subunit 1). The amino acid sequence of RGA1 was 77% and 86% identical to the sequences of alpha subunits from Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (products of GPA1 and TGA1), respectively, and 42% to 69% identical to sequences of mammalian alpha subunits. The regions essential for binding to GTP were preserved throughout all alpha subunits from higher plants and mammals. However, the C-terminal amino acid sequence, which has been proposed to be a receptor-binding region, of RGA1 was different not only from the analogous sequences of mammalian alpha subunits but also from those of the products of GPA1 and TGA1. The mRNA for RGA1, of 1.7 kb in length, was found in the roots and in the etiolated and greening leaves of rice, suggesting that RGA1 might be a protein that is expressed constitutively.
8665097	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA for the beta subunit of a G protein from rice.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated a cDNA for the beta subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was 76% an 94% homologus to the sequences of the beta subunits from Arabidopsis and maize (AG beta 1 and ZG beta 1), respectively.
16412081	Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+.	2006	Plant J	Only graminaceous monocots possess the Strategy II iron (Fe)-uptake system in which Fe is absorbed by roots as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore. In spite of being a Strategy II plant, however, rice (Oryza sativa) contains the previously identified Fe2+ transporter OsIRT1. In this study, we isolated the OsIRT2 gene from rice, which is highly homologous to OsIRT1. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions. When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant. This was similar to the effect of OsIRT1 cDNA. OsIRT1- and OsIRT2-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermal cells. OsIRT1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsIRT1 is expressed in the epidermis and exodermis of the elongating zone and in the inner layer of the cortex of the mature zone of Fe-deficient roots. OsIRT1 expression was also detected in the ccompanion cells. Analysis using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system showed that rice plants are able to take up both an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and Fe2+. This result indicates that, in addition to absorbing an Fe3+-phytosiderophore, rice possesses a novel Fe-uptake system that directly absorbs the Fe2+, a strategy that is advantageous for growth in submerged conditions.
7766047	Thioredoxin h is one of the major proteins in rice phloem sap.	1995	Planta	Sieve tubes play important roles in the transfer of nutrients as well as signals. Hundreds of proteins were found in pure phloem sap collected from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Kantou) plants through the cut ends of insect stylets. These proteins may be involved in nutrient transfer and signal transduction. To characterize the nature of these proteins, the partial amino-acid sequence of a 13-kDa protein, named RPP13-1, that was abundant in the pure phleom sap was determined. A cDNA clone of 687 bp, containing an open reading frame of 122 amino acids, was isolated using corresponding oligonucleotides as a probe. The deduced amino-acid sequence was very similar to that of the ubiquitous thiol redox protein, thioredoxin. The consensus sequences of thioredoxins are highly conserved. No putative signal peptide was identified. Antiserum against wheat thioredoxin h cross-reacted with RPP13-1 in the phloem sap of rice plants. RPP13-1 produced in Escherichia coli was reactive to antiserum against wheat thioredoxin h. Both E. coli-produced RPP13-1 and the phloem sap proteins catalyzed the reduction of the disulfide bonds of insulin in the presence of dithiothreitol. These results indicate that an active thioredoxin is a major protein translocating in rice sieve tubes.
15574840	Biochemical background and compartmentalized functions of cytosolic glutamine synthetase for active ammonium assimilation in rice roots.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice plants in paddy fields prefer to utilize ammonium as a major nitrogen source. Glutamine synthetase (GS) serves for assimilation of ammonium in rice root, and ameliorates the toxic effect of ammonium excess. Among the three isoenzymes of the cytosolic GS1 gene family in rice, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were abundantly expressed in roots. Analysis of the purified enzymes showed that OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 can be classified into high-affinity subtypes with relatively high V(max) values, as compared with the major high-affinity isoenzyme, GLN1;1, in Arabidopsis. Low-affinity forms of GS1 comparable to those in Arabidopsis (GLN1;2 and GLN1;3) were absent in rice roots. The OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 transcripts showed reciprocal responses to ammonium supply in the surface cell layers of roots. OsGLN1;1 accumulated in dermatogen, epidermis and exodermis under nitrogen-limited condition. By contrast, OsGLN1;2 was abundantly expressed in the same cell layers under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, replenishing the loss of OsGLN1;1 following ammonium treatment. Within the central cylinder of elongating zone, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were both induced by ammonium, which was distinguishable from the response observed in the surface cell layers. The high-capacity Gln synthetic activities of OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 facilitate active ammonium assimilation in specific cell types in rice roots.
1368754	Purification and characterization of rice peroxidases.	1991	Agric Biol Chem	Four peroxidase components, named RP-2, 4, 6, and 7, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) green leaves. Isoelectric focusing indicated that each preparation was homogeneous. The molecular weights of RP-2, 4, 6, and 7 estimated by SDS-PAGE were 48,000, 48,000, 40,000, and 39,500, and their isoelectric points were 5.4, 8.1, 9.3, and 9.2, respectively. The activity of every preparation was maximum around pH 5.0. Antisera against these purified enzymes were raised in rabbits. Ouchterlony double diffusion tests with these antisera suggested that RP-6 and 7 were immunochemically identical and RP-2 and 4 were identical in parts and that RP-6 and 7 were quite different from RP-2 and 4. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequences also showed that these peroxidase components were classified into two groups. The polymerase chain reaction showed that RP-2 and/or RP-4 contained an active central region, which is homologous to other plant peroxidases.

8973371	Sequences of two expressed sequence tags (EST) from rice encoding different cap-binding proteins.	1996	Gene	Wheat has been shown to have two forms of the cap-binding protein that participate in the initiation of translation. To identify cap-binding proteins from other higher plant species, the expressed sequence tag (EST) database was searched. Several rice ESTs were identified with similarity to both forms of the wheat cap-binding proteins. Two of the rice ESTs were obtained and the cDNA sequences completed. The deduced amino acid sequences of the rice cap-binding proteins are compared to the wheat cap-binding proteins and cap-binding proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis and human.
7669811	Classification of rice allergenic protein cDNAs belonging to the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor gene family.	1995	Biochim Biophys Acta	Seven cDNA clones encoding rice allergenic proteins were newly isolated. Comparison of the sequences of ten cDNA clones, including the previously isolated three clones results in their classification into four subfamilies. Homologies in the nucleotide sequences among and within subfamilies are 70-85% and above 95%, respectively. A sequence of twenty five amino-acid residues at the C-terminal proximal region is highly conserved among all clones and resembles that of plant lipid transfer proteins.
2545704	The encoded primary sequence of a rice seed ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunit and its homology to the bacterial enzyme.	1989	J Biol Chem	Rice seed ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase cDNA clones were isolated by screening a lambda expression library prepared from rice endosperm poly(A+) RNA with a heterologous antibody raised against the spinach leaf enzyme and subsequently by nucleic acid hybridization. One cDNA plasmid, possessing about 1650 nucleotides, was shown by both DNA and RNA sequence analysis to contain the complete ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase coding sequence of 483 amino acids. The primary sequence displayed a putative leader peptide presumably required for transport of this nuclear encoded protein into the amyloplasts, a differentiated starch containing plastid. The leader peptide, however, showed little sequence homology with transit peptides displayed by other known nuclear encoded proteins localized in the chloroplasts. A comparison of the primary sequence of the putative mature subunit to the Escherichia coli pyrophosphorylase showed two regions displaying significant homology. These two conserved regions contain residues shown previously to be essential for the allosteric regulation and catalytic activity of the E. coli enzyme. Differences in the primary sequences of the plant and bacterial enzyme may reflect the distinct nature of the allosteric effectors that control these enzymes.
1847888	Molecular characterization of the gene encoding a rice endosperm-specific ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase subunit and its developmental pattern of transcription.	1991	Gene	The gene encoding a rice endosperm-specific ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPP) subunit was isolated and its structure determined by nucleotide (nt) sequencing. A comparison of the genomic and cDNA nt sequences revealed a complex gene structure with ten exons and nine introns spanning over 6 kb. The exons ranged in size from 293 to 99 nt and the introns were between 1435 and 84 nt in size, with the first intron being the largest. All of the intron splice sites, except intron-2, contained GT/AG borders and were similar to the published splice site consensus sequences. Intron-2 had CA/CC borders at the 5' and 3' ends, but sequences adjacent to the splice site borders shared homology to the splice site consensus sequence, suggesting that the overall splice region, rather than the specific GT/AG sequence, determines the splice site. Several sequence motifs which may play a role in the regulation of plant genes were evident upstream from the transcriptional start point. Analysis of the developmental pattern of expression revealed a maximum level of mRNA transcripts for AGPP at five days after flowering coincident with starch accumulation. This result suggests that starch biosynthesis is controlled at the transcriptional level during seed development.
8286405	Nucleotide sequence of a rice root ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase cDNA and its induction by nitrate.	1994	Biochim Biophys Acta	A ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) cDNA was isolated from a lambda gt 11 cDNA library constructed from the roots of nitrate-induced rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Kinmaze) seedlings. The nucleotide sequence of this clone contains a 1134 nucleotide open reading frame. The N-terminal 62 amino acid stretch was assigned to the transit sequence, followed by 316 residues for the mature protein. The rice root FNR shows only 49% sequence identity to that of the leaf enzyme, but the regions of the binding sites to ferredoxin, NADP-PPi and NADP+ are highly conserved between the two enzymes. The root FNR mRNA was induced transiently by the addition of nitrate, but not by ammonia. The results support the view that the root FNR is involved in the nitrate assimilation in nonchlorophyllous tissues.
8016278	Sequence of a cDNA encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase.	1994	Plant Physiol	
7748889	The genomic organization of the gene encoding a nitrate-inducible ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase from rice roots.	1995	Biochim Biophys Acta	A genomic clone of the gene encoding a nitrate-inducible ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots has been isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. The clone contains 3897 nucleotides of the gene which consists of six exons interrupted by five introns. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension analysis which locates 64 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon. The 5'-flanking region contains canonical TATA- and CAAT-boxes, and a potential Sp1-binding site. Four ATCAA(A/C) and two inverted TTTGAT sequences are localized in the promoter region and a TGTAA motif occurs three times in the 3'-untranslated region. No significant similarity was found when the 5' flanking region was compared with that of the photosynthetic FNR gene.
12668768	The sucrose transporter gene family in rice.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5. Three of the four genes were identified through extensive searches of the recently published draft sequence of the rice genome. Along with the previously reported OsSUT1 we propose that these five genes comprise the rice SUT gene family. Complementary DNA clones were isolated for the four newly identified genes. The deduced proteins of all five SUT genes were predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning helices and a domain highly conserved throughout all known plant SUTs, suggesting the four additional OsSUT genes encode functional SUTs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed in order to investigate the expression pattern of each member of the SUT family in rice. A differing but overlapping expression pattern was observed for each member of the SUT family at different stages through plant development. These results, together with the structural variations apparent from the deduced protein sequences, suggest that the five SUTs possess diverse roles in both sink and source tissues. We also discuss the classification and evolution of the rice SUT gene family, using a comparison of the gene structures and deduced amino acid sequences with other known plant SUT genes.
10359080	A novel plant nuclear gene encoding chloroplast ribosomal protein S9 has a transit peptide related to that of rice chloroplast ribosomal protein L12.	1999	FEBS Lett	We have cloned a novel nuclear gene for a ribosomal protein of rice and Arabidopsis that is like the bacterial ribosomal protein S9. To determine the subcellular localization of the gene product, we fused the N-terminal region and green fluorescent protein and expressed it transiently in rice seedlings. Localized fluorescence was detectable only in chloroplasts, indicating that this nuclear gene encodes chloroplast ribosomal protein S9. The N-terminal region of rice ribosomal protein S9 was found to have a high sequence similarity to the transit peptide region of the rice chloroplast ribosomal protein L12, suggesting that these transit peptides have a common lineage.
9445479	Molecular analysis of cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.	1998	Science	Cellulose, an abundant, crystalline polysaccharide, is central to plant morphogenesis and to many industries. Chemical and ultrastructural analyses together with map-based cloning indicate that the RSW1 locus of Arabidopsis encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The cloned gene complements the rsw1 mutant whose temperature-sensitive allele is changed in one amino acid. The mutant allele causes a specific reduction in cellulose synthesis, accumulation of noncrystalline beta-1,4-glucan, disassembly of cellulose synthase, and widespread morphological abnormalities. Microfibril crystallization may require proper assembly of the RSW1 gene product into synthase complexes whereas glucan biosynthesis per se does not.
9390447	Rice hemoglobins. Gene cloning, analysis, and O2-binding kinetics of a recombinant protein synthesized in Escherichia coli.	1997	Plant Physiol	Although nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (Hbs) are found in different tissues of dicots and monocots, very little is known about hb genes in monocots and the function of Hbs in nonsymbiotic tissues. We report the cloning and analysis of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) hb genes, hb1 and hb2, that code for plant Hbs. Rice hb1 and hb2 genes contain four exons and three introns, as with all of the known plant hb genes. At least three copies of the hb gene were detected in rice DNA, and analysis of gene expression shows that hb1 and hb2 are expressed in leaves but only hb1 is expressed in roots. A cDNA for rice Hb1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant Hb (rHb1) shows an unusually high affinity for O2 because of a very low dissociation constant. The absorbance spectra of the ferric and deoxyferrous rHb1 indicate that, in contrast to symbiotic Hbs, a distal ligand is coordinated to the ligand-binding site. Mutation of the distal His demonstrates that this residue coordinates the heme Fe of ferric and deoxyferrous rHb1 and stabilizes O2 in oxy-rHb1. The biochemical properties of rice rHb1 suggest that this protein probably does not function to facilitate the diffusion of O2.
8520124	Evidence for the occurrence of multiple aspartic proteinases in rice seeds.	1995	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified two cDNA fragments encoding aspartic proteinases (APs). The encoded proteins, pL4 and pL5, are similar in sequence to other plant APs including barley AP and cardoon flower AP (cyprosin). The identity was 58-76% with one another. Genomic Southern blot analysis suggested that the rice AP gene constitutes a multigene family.
7556174	Rice aspartic proteinase, oryzasin, expressed during seed ripening and germination, has a gene organization distinct from those of animal and microbial aspartic proteinases.	1995	Eur J Biochem	The gene organization and nucleotide sequence of an aspartic proteinase (AP) of plant origin were first disclosed by cDNA and genomic DNA cloning of a rice AP (oryzasin). The deduced amino acid sequence of oryzasin 1 was significantly similar to those of other APs (34-85%), with highest similarity (85%) to barley AP (HvAP). Oryzasin 1, as well as HvAP, is distinct from animal and microbial APs in that the plant APs contain a unique 104-amino-acid insertion in the C-terminal region. The oryzasin 1 gene spans approximately 6.6 kbp and is composed of 14 exons and 13 introns. The exon-intron organization of the oryzasin 1 gene is totally different from those of genes for animal and microbial APs such as human cathepsin D, rat renin, bovine chymosin, aspergillopepsin A of Aspergillus awamori, proteinase A of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rhizopuspepsin of Rhizopus niveus, despite the fact that oryzasin 1 shows overall sequence similarity to these APs.
12091721	Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a common origin, have different protein characteristics but both genes are predominantly expressed in rice phloem tissues.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	The genes for two types of rice phloem protein (RPP16 and RPP17) were isolated and characterized. Conservation of five exon sizes as well as splicing positions between the two genes suggest that either RPP16 or RPP17 is a resultant of gene duplication. By protein blot analysis, RPP16 and RPP17 proteins were specifically detected in soluble and insoluble fractions of a crude extract of rice plants, respectively, suggesting that these proteins play different roles in individual cells. The expression of Rpp16 and Rpp17 was monitored by the beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method. Rpp16-gusA and Rpp17-gusA were expressed preferentially in the phloem tissues from different parts of the plant, but almost no GUS staining was observed in the rest of the tissues. In roots of both constructs, interestingly, stronger GUS-accumulation was detected in younger vascular tissues than in aged vascular tissues. In situ hybridization also showed that Rpp17 was more strongly expressed in vascular tissues of tiller buds. These results suggest that transcript of these genes was more abundant in young tissues. The presence of two copies of the gene in higher plants, from a common origin, which have different protein characteristics, indicates that evolutionary diversification might have occurred in the gene function.
10468600	Rice gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant gene Dwarf 1 encodes the alpha-subunit of GTP-binding protein.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	A rice Dwarf 1 gene was identified by using a map-based cloning strategy. Its recessive mutant allele confers a dwarf phenotype. Linkage analysis revealed that a cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of GTP-binding protein cosegregated with d1 in 3,185 d1 segregants. Southern hybridization analysis with this cDNA as a probe showed different band patterns in several d1 mutant lines. In at least four independent d1 mutants, no gene transcript was observed by Northern hybridization analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed that an 833-bp deletion had occurred in one of the mutant alleles, which resulted in an inability to express GTP-binding protein. A transgenic d1 mutant with GTP-binding protein gene restored the normal phenotype. We conclude that the rice Dwarf 1 gene encodes GTP-binding protein and that the protein plays an important role in plant growth and development. Because the d1 mutant is classified as gibberellin-insensitive, we suggest that the GTP-binding protein might be associated with gibberellin signal transduction.
15976269	Cytokinin oxidase regulates rice grain production.	2005	Science	Most agriculturally important traits are regulated by genes known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural allelic variations. We here show that a QTL that increases grain productivity in rice, Gn1a, is a gene for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (OsCKX2), an enzyme that degrades the phytohormone cytokinin. Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield. QTL pyramiding to combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits. These results provide a strategy for tailormade crop improvement.
11487698	EMF1, a novel protein involved in the control of shoot architecture and flowering in Arabidopsis.	2001	Plant Cell	Shoot architecture and flowering time in angiosperms depend on the balanced expression of a large number of flowering time and flower meristem identity genes. Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) genes cause Arabidopsis to eliminate rosette shoot growth and transform the apical meristem from indeterminate to determinate growth by producing a single terminal flower on all nodes. We have identified the EMF1 gene by positional cloning. The deduced polypeptide has no homology with any protein of known function except a putative protein in the rice genome with which EMF1 shares common motifs that include nuclear localization signals, P-loop, and LXXLL elements. Alteration of EMF1 expression in transgenic plants caused progressive changes in flowering time, shoot determinacy, and inflorescence architecture. EMF1 and its related sequence may belong to a new class of proteins that function as transcriptional regulators of phase transition during shoot development.
9358062	Structure, organization and putative function of the genes identified within a 23.9-kb fragment from Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV.	1997	Gene	In the framework of the complete genome sequencing programme of the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana, a 23.9-kb fragment from the long arm of chromosome IV has been analysed. This paper presents a methodological approach, integrating computerized predictions, database screening, the sequencing of cognate cDNAs and a PCR-based detection of expression that allows the accumulation of an important amount of information from an anonymous sequence. This work revealed the organization of novel genes and the vestige of a copia-like retrotransposon. The gene AtRH1 encodes the first member of a new subfamily of the plant DEAD box RNA helicases. A recurrent and complete search of dbEST has been used to evaluate the number of different RNA helicases expressed in A. thaliana. On the 18 discriminated members of the family, only a small number seems to be expressed at a relatively high level. The putative gene AtTS1 encodes a novel terpene synthase in A. thaliana, and the genes G14587-5 and G14587-6 encode unknown proteins. This study illustrates most of the situations that could be encountered during the analysis of an anonymous sequence from A. thaliana.
1731971	Structure and expression of a root-specific rice gene.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	Two rice cDNA clones (COS6 and COS9) were isolated, corresponding to genes that were highly expressed in roots from seedlings and mature plants. A genomic clone (GOS9) corresponding to cDNA clone COS9 was isolated and the intron/exon structure was determined by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the mRNA and the genomic clone. 5' ends and 3' ends of the mRNA were determined by primer extension and S1-nuclease mapping respectively. The open reading frame present in GOS9 potentially encodes a protein (14 kDa) that does not show any significant homology to other proteins in databases.
1302635	The promoter of the rice gene GOS2 is active in various different monocot tissues and binds rice nuclear factor ASF-1.	1992	Plant J	A single copy gene has been isolated, termed GOS2, from rice. Sequence comparison revealed highly similar genes in mammals and yeast, indicating that GOS2 encodes an evolutionary conserved protein. GOS2 mRNA was detected in all tissues examined. When the upstream region was translationally fused to the reporter gene gusA it was found to drive expression in a variety of rice tissues and in cell suspensions of other monocot species following introduction by particle bombardment. Therefore, the GOS2 promoter is potentially useful for genetic engineering of monocots. A DNA-binding activity from rice, termed rice ASF-1, with similar binding specificity as the cloned tobacco transcription factor TGA-1a, was found to bind to a TGACG sequence motif in the GOS2 promoter. Possible roles for rice ASF-1 in the transcriptional activation of the GOS2 promoter are discussed.
7518089	Identification, cDNA cloning, and gene expression of soluble starch synthase in rice (Oryza sativa L.) immature seeds.	1993	Plant Physiol	Three forms of soluble starch synthase were resolved by anion-exchange chromatography of soluble extracts from immature rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds, and each of these forms was further purified by affinity chromatograph. The 55-, 57-, and 57-kD proteins in the three preparations were identified as candidates for soluble starch synthase by western blot analysis using an antiserum against rice granule-bound starch synthase. It is interesting that the amino-terminal amino acid sequence was identical among the three proteins, except that the 55-kD protein lacked eight amino acids at the amino terminus. Thus, these three proteins are products of the same gene. The cDNA clones coding for this protein have been isolated from an immature rice seed library in lambda gt11 using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains a lysine-X-glycine-glycine consensus sequence for the ADP-glucose-binding site of starch and glycogen synthases. Therefore, we conclude that this protein corresponds to a form of soluble starch synthase in immature rice seeds. The precursor of the enzyme contains 626 amino acids, including a 113-residue transit peptide at the amino terminus. The mature form of soluble starch synthase shares a significant but low sequence identity with rice granule-bound starch synthase and Escherichia coli glycogen synthase. However, several regions, including the substrate-binding site, are highly conserved among these three enzymes. Blot hybridization analysis demonstrates that the gene encoding soluble starch synthase is a single-copy gene in the rice genome and is expressed in both leaves and immature seeds. These results suggest that soluble and granule-bound starch synthases play distinct roles in starch biosynthesis of plant.
12466291	Diversity in nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat genes in cereals.	2002	Genome Res	The diversity of the largest group of plant disease resistance genes, the nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes, was examined in cereals following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning and database mining. NBS-LRR genes in rice are a large and diverse class with more than 600 genes, at least three to four times the complement of Arabidopsis. Most occur in small families containing one or a few cross-hybridizing members. Unlike in Arabidopsis and other dicots, the class of NBS-LRR genes coding for a Toll and mammalian interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain were not amplified during the evolution of the cereals. Genes coding for TIR domains are present in the rice genome, but have diverged from the NBS-LRR genes. Most cereal genes are similar in structure to the members of the non-TIR class of dicots, although many do not code for a coiled-coil domain in their amino termini. One unique class of cereal genes, with ~50 members, codes for proteins similar to the N-termini and NBS domains of resistance genes but does not code for LRR domains. The resistance gene repertoire of grasses has changed from that of dicots in their independent evolution since the two groups diverged. It is not clear whether this reflects a difference in downstream defense signaling pathways.
12376644	Inventory and functional characterization of the HAK potassium transporters of rice.	2002	Plant Physiol	Plants take up large amounts of K(+) from the soil solution and distribute it to the cells of all organs, where it fulfills important physiological functions. Transport of K(+) from the soil solution to its final destination is mediated by channels and transporters. To better understand K(+) movements in plants, we intended to characterize the function of the large KT-HAK-KUP family of transporters in rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare). By searching in databases and cDNA cloning, we have identified 17 genes (OsHAK1-17) encoding transporters of this family and obtained evidence of the existence of other two genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the encoded transporters reveals a great diversity among them, and three distant transporters, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, and OsHAK10, were expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial mutants to determine their functions. The three transporters mediate K(+) influxes or effluxes, depending on the conditions of the experiment. A comparative kinetic analysis of HAK-mediated K(+) influx in yeast and in roots of K(+)-starved rice seedlings demonstrated the involvement of HAK transporters in root K(+) uptake. We discuss that all HAK transporters may mediate K(+) transport, but probably not only in the plasma membrane. Transient expression of the OsHAK10-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in living onion epidermal cells targeted this protein to the tonoplast.
2103437	Variation in the nucleotide sequence of a prolamin gene family in wild rice.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	Variation in the DNA sequence of the 10 kDa prolamin gene family within the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon was probed using the direct sequencing of PCR-amplified genes. A comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences of eight Asian strains of O. rufipogon and one strain of the related African species O. longistaminata is presented.
3368456	Partial phylogeny of the unicellular eukaryotes based on rapid sequencing of a portion of 28S ribosomal RNA.	1988	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Using a rapid rRNA sequencing technique, we have determined the sequence of the 400 nucleotides located at the 5' end of the large subunit rRNA molecule from eight species of unicellular eukaryotes (protists). This region contains a pair of conservative domains well-suited for long-range phylogenetic evaluations among eukaryotes, due both to their substantia, length and to their intrinsic rate of sequence variation during evolution. It also comprises a central more rapidly evolving portion, which allows for a fine tuning of distance evaluation between closely related species. Molecular distances were computed between the aligned nucleotides of all presently available protist sequences and were used to derive a tentative dendrogram. Within the limitations inherent to this approach, a number of interesting observations emerge: The various protist groups appear to have separated very early from each other. The most deeply divergent protists belong to a number of orders of flagellates (mastigotes), suggesting a very ancient origin for organelles containing a 9 + 2 microtubular arrangement. Ciliates emerged late among eukaryotes, suggesting that their peculiar genetic code was derived secondarily. Moreover, a dinoflagellate clusters with ciliates, thus making it likely that the unusual features of nuclear organization and mitosis of this group are not primitive but derived characters. Finally, within groups, taxonomic and evolutionary inferences appear to be feasible using this portion of the rRNA.
15282953	A partial sequence of lipoxygenase gene from genomic DNA of aromatic rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Indian J Exp Biol	Aromatic (Bas-370, PB-1) and non-aromatic (Pusa-677, Pusa-834) rice were selected for the characterization and for distribution of lipoxygenase (Lox) genes. Polymorphism was observed when genomic DNA of rice varieties was hybridized with a heterologous lipoxygenase probe. A distinct polymorphic fragment (approximately 1.2 kb) was found in Bas-370. Sub-genomic library of Bas-370 was constructed and screened with LoxA probe. The smallest putative clone (pBas-14) of approximately 1.2 kb was sequenced. Complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence showed the clone was 1134 bp long and comprised of 378 amino acid residues. PCR amplification of genomic DNA from four rice varieties with a soybean Lox primer also showed a polymorphic fragment of size approximately 600 bp (amplicon) in aromatic varieties that was sequenced directly. Nucleotide sequence alignment between pBas-14 and amplicon concluded that the amplicon was a part of the insert pBas-14.
11094977	Rice PHYC gene: structure, expression, map position and evolution.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	Although sequences representing members of the phytochrome (phy) family of photoreceptors have been reported in numerous species across the phylogenetic spectrum, relatively few phytochrome genes (PHY) have been fully characterized. Using rice, we have cloned and characterized the first PHYC gene from a monocot. Comparison of genomic and cDNA PHYC sequences shows that the rice PHYC gene contains three introns in the protein-coding region typical of most angiosperm PHY genes, in contrast to Arabidopsis PHYC, which lacks the third intron. Mapping of the transcription start site and 5'-untranslated region of the rice PHYC transcript indicates that it contains an unusually long, intronless, 5'-untranslated leader sequence of 715 bp. PHYC mRNA levels are relatively low compared to PHYA and PHYB mRNAs in rice seedlings, and are similar in dark- and light-treated seedlings, suggesting relatively low constitutive expression. Genomic mapping shows that the PHYA, PHYB, and PHYC genes are all located on chromosome 3 of rice, in synteny with these genes in linkage group C (sometimes referred to as linkage group A) of sorghum. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that rice phyC is closely related to sorghum phyC, but relatively strongly divergent from Arabidopsis phyC, the only full-length dicot phyC sequence available.
8616217	The macrophage-specific membrane protein Nramp controlling natural resistance to infections in mice has homologues expressed in the root system of plants.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	In mice, natural resistance or susceptibility to infection with Mycobacteria, Salmonella, and Leishmania is controlled by a gene named Bcg. Bcg regulates the capacity of macrophages to limit intracellular replication of the ingested parasites, and is believed to regulate a key bactericidal mechanism of this cell. Recently, we have cloned the Bcg gene and shown that it encodes a novel macrophage-specific membrane protein designated Nramp. A routine search of the public databases for sequences homologous to Nramp identified 3 expressed sequence tags (EST) that show strong similarities to the mammalian protein. We report the identification and cloning of a full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a plant homologue (OsNramp1) of mammalian Nramp. Predicted amino acid sequence of the plant protein indicates a remarkable degree of similarity (60% homology) with its mammalian counterpart, including identical number, position, and composition of transmembrane domains, glycosylation signals, and consensus transport motif, suggesting an identical overall secondary structure and membrane organization for the two proteins. This high degree of structural similarity indicates that the two proteins may be functionally related, possibly through a common mechanism of transport. RNA hybridization studies and RT-PCR analyses indicate that OsNramp1 mRNA is expressed primarily in roots and only at very low levels in leaves/stem. DNA hybridization studies indicate that OsNramp1 is not a single gene, but rather forms part of a novel gene family which has several members in all plants tested including cereals such as rice, wheat, and corn, and also in common weed species. The striking degree of conservation between the macrophage-specific mammalian Nramp and its OsNramp1 plant homologue is discussed with respect to possible implications in the metabolism of nitrate in both organisms.
9154989	Cloning and characterization of the OsNramp family from Oryza sativa, a new family of membrane proteins possibly implicated in the transport of metal ions.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The mammalian Nramp1 protein is an integral membrane protein expressed exclusively in macrophages, where it plays a critical role in the ability of these cells to destroy ingested microbes. The bactericidal mechanism of action of Nramp1 remains unknown. We report the identification and characterization of cDNA clones corresponding to three homologues of the mammalian Nramp1 gene from the genome of Oryza sativa, OsNramp1, OsNramp2, and OsNramp3. These three genes encode a novel group of highly similar hydrophobic polypeptides sharing between 64% and 75% sequence similarity, that show similar hydropathy profiles, and predicted secondary structure, including the same number, position, and sequence characteristics (including conserved charges) of transmembrane domains. Together, these define a highly conserved membrane associated hydrophobic core. The three plant proteins show a remarkable degree of sequence similarity with their mammalian counterpart (60% to 70% similarity), including primary and secondary structure elements previously described in ion transporters and channels. Expression studies in normal plant tissues indicate that while OsNramp1 is expressed primarily in roots, and OsNramp2 is primarily expressed in leaves, OsNramp3 is expressed in both tissues. The recent discovery that the yeast Nramp homologue SMF1 functions as a manganese transporter raises the exciting possibility that OsNramp encodes a family of metal ion transporters in plants.
15659452	The rice nucellin gene ortholog OsAsp1 encodes an active aspartic protease without a plant-specific insert and is strongly expressed in early embryo.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	The barley nucellin gene was reported to be nucellus specific in its expression and was hypothesized to play a role in the programmed cell death of the nucellus as an aspartic protease. Here we provide direct evidence that the rice ortholog encodes an active aspartic protease, but we prefer the name aspartic protease1 (OsAsp1) to nucellin after a detailed analysis of its expression pattern in rice and barley. Northern blots, RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsAsp1 is expressed most abundantly in zygotic embryos 1-2 d after fertilization. It is also expressed in pollen, nucellus, ovary wall, shoot and root meristem, coleoptiles of immature seeds, and somatic embryos. A parallel study in barley showed that the barley nucellin gene was expressed not only in the nucellus but also strongly in embryos. Recombinant protein proOsAsp1 expressed in the bacterium Escherichia coli refolded and autolysed at acidic pH 3.5 in vitro, and the mature peptide displayed protease activity. Nucellin has three close homologs in rice on chromosomes 11 and 12 and in Arabidopsis on chromosomes 1 and 4. They lack the plant-specific insert that distinguishes the typical plant aspartic protease from aspartic proteases of other organisms. They constitute a new class of aspartic protease that is present in both monocots and dicots but whose function remains to be explored further.
16668981	Molecular cloning and characterization of genes related to chilling tolerance in rice.	1992	Plant Physiol	Polyadenylated RNA was isolated and a cDNA library constructed from seedlings of a chilling-tolerant rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L. subsp. Japonica cv Nipponbare). Four clones were isolated by differential screening. Northern blot hybridization using RNAs from chilling-tolerant (Nipponbare) and -sensitive (IR36) cultivars revealed higher steady-state levels of transcripts for the four genes in Nipponbare than in IR36 maintained at the same low temperatures. The accumulation of transcripts homologous to selected cDNA sequences during chilling were tissue-specific. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of three clones, pBC121, pBC442, and pBC591, were determined, and no homology was identified by comparison with the latest version of EMBL and LASL gene data bases. The deduced protein sequences from the longest open reading frame of the clones pBC121 and pBC442 are rich in leucine and serine, whereas that of the clone pBC591 contains arginine-rich basic domains.
12677405	High resolution genetic mapping and candidate gene identification at the xa5 locus for bacterial blight resistance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.).	2003	Theor Appl Genet	The xa5 resistance gene from rice provides recessive, race-specific resistance to bacterial blight of rice caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. A high-resolution genetic map of the chromosomal region surrounding xa5 was developed by placing 44 DNA markers on the distal end of rice chromosome 5. The basis for mapping was a PCR-based screening of 1,016 F(2) individuals derived from a cross between a near-isogenic line (NIL) and its corresponding recurrent parent to identify recombinants in the region. Recombinant F(2) individuals were progeny tested using F(3) families inoculated with the Philippine strain PXO 61 of bacterial blight pathogen. The xa5 gene was mapped to a 0.5-cM interval between the markers RS7 and RM611, which spanned an interval of approximately 70 kb and contained a total of 11 open reading frames. Sequence data for the locus was generated from an Indica (the IR24 isoline, IRBB21) BAC covering part of the region and compared to other overlapping Indica (cv 93-11) and Japonica (cv Nipponbare) sequences. Candidate-gene analysis revealed that a basal transcription factor (TFIIa), an ABC transporter, a tRNA synthase, a MAP kinase and a cysteine protease, as well as four unknown, hypothetical or putative proteins, are encoded at the locus and could be potential candidates for the resistance gene product. The mechanism by which these genes could provide recessive, race-specific resistance will be elucidated by map-based cloning of the xa5 gene.
9746350	Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis.	1998	Eur J Biochem	Two methyl transfers are involved in the biosynthesis of 24-methyl and 24-ethyl sterols, which play major roles in plant growth and development. The first methyl transfer applies to cycloartenol, the second to 24-methylene lophenol. About ten cDNA clones encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) sterol methyltransferases (SMTs) have been isolated so far from various plants. According to their deduced amino acid sequences, they were classified in two families, smtl and smt2; in addition, smt2 cDNAs were shown to encode a 24-methylene lophenol C24 methyltransferase [Bouvier-Navé, P., Husselstein, T., Desprez, T. & Benveniste, P. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 246, 518-529]. We now report the comparison of two cDNAs isolated from Nicotiana tabacum, Ntsmt1-1 which belongs to the first SMT cDNA family and Ntsmt2-1 which belongs to the second. Both cDNAs were expressed in the yeast null mutant erg6, deficient in SMT. Whereas erg6 is devoid of 24-alkyl sterols, erg6 Ntsmt1-1 contained a majority of 24-methylene sterols and erg6 Ntsmt2-1, a majority of 24-ethylidene sterols, indicating distinct functions for the expression products of these cDNAs. In the presence of AdoMet, delipidated microsomes from erg6 Ntsm1-1 efficiently converted cycloartenol into 24-methylene cycloartanol, but did not produce any 24-ethylidene lophenol upon incubation with 24-methylene lophenol. This demonstrates that cDNA Ntsmt1-1 (and most probably the other plant SMT cDNAs of the first family) encode(s) a cycloartenol C24 methyltransferase. In contrast, delipidated microsomes of erg6 Ntsmt2-1 were shown to methylate preferentially 24-methylene lophenol, as expected from an SMT encoded by an smt2 cDNA. In summary, among various cDNAs isolated from N. tabacum, one (Ntsmt1-1) belongs to the first family of plant SMT cDNAs according to its deduced amino acid sequence and was shown to encode a cycloartenol C24 methyltransferase, whereas another (Ntsmt2-1) belongs to the second family and was shown to encode a 24-methylene lophenol C24 methyltransferase. Meanwhile, two cDNAs were isolated from Oriza sativa and shown to belong to smtl and to smt2 families, respectively. These data disclose the coexistence, in a given plant species, of two distinct SMTs, each catalyzing one step of methylation in the sterol biosynthesis pathway.
8132486	Chemical, immunological, enzymatic, and genetic approaches to studying the arrangement of the peptide chain of the ADP/ATP carrier in the mitochondrial membrane.	1993	J Bioenerg Biomembr	In the process of oxidative phosphorylation, the exchange of cytosolic ADP3- against mitochondrial ATP4- across the inner mitochondrial membrane is mediated by a specific carrier protein. Two different conformations for this carrier have been demonstrated on the basis of interactions with specific inhibitors, namely carboxyatractyloside (CATR) and bongkrekic acid (BA). The two conformations, referred to as CATR and BA conformations, are interconvertible, provided that ADP or ATP are present. The functional ADP/ATP carrier is probably organized as a tetramer. In the presence of CATR or BA the tetramer is split into two dimers combined with either of the two inhibitors. The amino acid sequence of the beef heart carrier monomer (297 residues) contains three repeats of about 100 residues each. Experimental results obtained through different approaches, including photolabeling, immunochemistry, and limited proteolysis, can be interpreted on the basis of a model with five or six transmembrane alpha helices per carrier monomer. Two mobile regions involved in the binding of nucleotides and accessible to proteolytic enzymes have been identified. Each of them may be visualized as consisting of two pairs of short amphipathic alpha helices, which can be juxtaposed to form hydrophilic channels facilitating the nucleotide transport. Mutagenesis in yeast is currently being used to detect strategic amino acids in ADP/ATP transport.
12746512	Expression profiling and bioinformatic analyses of a novel stress-regulated multispanning transmembrane protein family from cereals and Arabidopsis.	2003	Plant Physiol	Cold acclimation is a multigenic trait that allows hardy plants to develop efficient tolerance mechanisms needed for winter survival. To determine the genetic nature of these mechanisms, several cold-responsive genes of unknown function were identified from cold-acclimated wheat (Triticum aestivum). To identify the putative functions and structural features of these new genes, integrated genomic approaches of data mining, expression profiling, and bioinformatic predictions were used. The analyses revealed that one of these genes is a member of a small family that encodes two distinct groups of multispanning transmembrane proteins. The cold-regulated (COR)413-plasma membrane and COR413-thylakoid membrane groups are potentially targeted to the plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane, respectively. Further sequence analysis of the two groups from different plant species revealed the presence of a highly conserved phosphorylation site and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring site at the C-terminal end. No homologous sequences were found in other organisms suggesting that this family is specific to the plant kingdom. Intraspecies and interspecies comparative gene expression profiling shows that the expression of this gene family is correlated with the development of freezing tolerance in cereals and Arabidopsis. In addition, several members of the family are regulated by water stress, light, and abscisic acid. Structure predictions and comparative genome analyses allow us to propose that the cor413 genes encode putative G-protein-coupled receptors.

7766885	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated, from a cDNA library constructed from rice coleoptiles, two sequences, OSCPK2 and OSCPK11, that encode for putative calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11-predicted protein sequences are 533 and 542 amino acids (aa) long with a corresponding molecular mass of 59436 and 61079 Da respectively. Within their polypeptide chain, they all contain those conserved features that define a plant CDPK; kinase catalytic sequences are linked to a calmodulin-like regulatory domain through a junction region. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif. In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2.4 and 3.5 kb long respectively. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles. A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript. With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant.
11090207	tA single amino acid difference distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta.	2000	Plant Cell	The rice blast resistance (R) gene Pi-ta mediates gene-for-gene resistance against strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that express avirulent alleles of AVR-Pita. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we cloned Pi-ta, which is linked to the centromere of chromosome 12. Pi-ta encodes a predicted 928-amino acid cytoplasmic receptor with a centrally localized nucleotide binding site. A single-copy gene, Pi-ta shows low constitutive expression in both resistant and susceptible rice. Susceptible rice varieties contain pi-ta(-) alleles encoding predicted proteins that share a single amino acid difference relative to the Pi-ta resistance protein: serine instead of alanine at position 918. Transient expression in rice cells of a Pi-ta(+) R gene together with AVR-Pita(+) induces a resistance response. No resistance response is induced in transient assays that use a naturally occurring pi-ta(-) allele differing only by the serine at position 918. Rice varieties reported to have the linked Pi-ta(2) gene contain Pi-ta plus at least one other R gene, potentially explaining the broadened resistance spectrum of Pi-ta(2) relative to Pi-ta. Molecular cloning of the AVR-Pita and Pi-ta genes will aid in deployment of R genes for effective genetic control of rice blast disease.
8075400	Cyclophilins are encoded by a small gene family in rice.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced that encode two related but distinct rice cyclophilins, Cyp1 and Cyp2. The predicted amino acid sequences of each are 72% identical to human T-cell cyclophilin. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis suggests cyclophilins in rice are encoded by a small, 6-10-member gene family. Both Cyp1 and Cyp2 have seven extra amino acid residues in the N-terminal portion of the proteins that are not found in human or other non-plant cyclophilins, suggesting that this is a characteristic of plant cyclophilins. Cyp2 was expressed as 1000 nt transcripts in leaf and root tissues. Cyp1 was expressed as 800 and 900 nt transcripts. Whereas the 900 nt transcript was present in both root and leaf mRNA, the 800 nt transcript was only detectable in root mRNA. A genomic clone of Cyp2 was isolated, sequenced and shown to lack introns. A single transcriptional start site was identified 27 residues downstream of a putative TATA box. The 5' end of the transcript was shown to contain a region rich in adenyl residues (27 of 35). This region would not be conducive to secondary structure formation, which raises the possibility that Cyp2 might be preferentially translated during stress conditions.

12897790	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content.	2003	Nat Biotechnol	Tocotrienols are the primary form of vitamin E in seeds of most monocot plants, including cereals such as rice and wheat. As potent antioxidants, tocotrienols contribute to the nutritive value of cereal grains in human and livestock diets. cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds. Transgenic expression of the barley HGGT in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves resulted in accumulation of tocotrienols, which were absent from leaves of nontransformed plants, and a 10- to 15-fold increase in total vitamin E antioxidants (tocotrienols plus tocopherols). Overexpression of the barley HGGT in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold. These results provide insight into the genetic basis for tocotrienol biosynthesis in plants and demonstrate the ability to enhance the antioxidant content of crops by introduction of an enzyme that redirects metabolic flux.

24927545	Plant roots use a patterning mechanism to position lateral root branches toward available water.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The architecture of the branched root system of plants is a major determinant of vigor. Water availability is known to impact root physiology and growth; however, the spatial scale at which this stimulus influences root architecture is poorly understood. Here we reveal that differences in the availability of water across the circumferential axis of the root create spatial cues that determine the position of lateral root branches. We show that roots of several plant species can distinguish between a wet surface and air environments and that this also impacts the patterning of root hairs, anthocyanins, and aerenchyma in a phenomenon we describe as hydropatterning. This environmental response is distinct from a touch response and requires available water to induce lateral roots along a contacted surface. X-ray microscale computed tomography and 3D reconstruction of soil-grown root systems demonstrate that such responses also occur under physiologically relevant conditions. Using early-stage lateral root markers, we show that hydropatterning acts before the initiation stage and likely determines the circumferential position at which lateral root founder cells are specified. Hydropatterning is independent of endogenous abscisic acid signaling, distinguishing it from a classic water-stress response. Higher water availability induces the biosynthesis and transport of the lateral root-inductive signal auxin through local regulation of tryptophan aminotransferase of Arabidopsis 1 and PIN-formed 3, both of which are necessary for normal hydropatterning. Our work suggests that water availability is sensed and interpreted at the suborgan level and locally patterns a wide variety of developmental processes in the root.
24753598	Beyond the single gene: How epistasis and gene-by-environment effects influence crop domestication.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Domestication is a multifaceted evolutionary process, involving changes in individual genes, genetic interactions, and emergent phenotypes. There has been extensive discussion of the phenotypic characteristics of plant domestication, and recent research has started to identify the specific genes and mutational mechanisms that control domestication traits. However, there is an apparent disconnect between the simple genetic architecture described for many crop domestication traits, which should facilitate rapid phenotypic change under selection, and the slow rate of change reported from the archeobotanical record. A possible explanation involves the middle ground between individual genetic changes and their expression during development, where gene-by-gene (epistatic) and gene-by-environment interactions can modify the expression of phenotypes and opportunities for selection. These aspects of genetic architecture have the potential to significantly slow the speed of phenotypic evolution during crop domestication and improvement. Here we examine whether epistatic and gene-by-environment interactions have shaped how domestication traits have evolved. We review available evidence from the literature, and we analyze two domestication-related traits, shattering and flowering time, in a mapping population derived from a cross between domesticated foxtail millet and its wild progenitor. We find that compared with wild progenitor alleles, those favored during domestication often have large phenotypic effects and are relatively insensitive to genetic background and environmental effects. Consistent selection should thus be able to rapidly change traits during domestication. We conclude that if phenotypic evolution was slow during crop domestication, this is more likely due to cultural or historical factors than epistatic or environmental constraints.
25034662	Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies of plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene.	2014	Gene	The oxidative breakdown of carotenoid evidences the formation of apocarotenoids through carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). Numerous CCDs and apocarotenoids have been identified and characterized in plants. Using available sequence data, a study was performed to investigate the phylogenetic relationship among CCD genes and to statistically estimate the sequence conservation and functional divergence. In total, 77 genes were identified from 39 species belonging to 21 families. Our result of phylogenetic analysis indicated the existence of well-conserved subfamilies. Moreover, comparative genomic analysis showed that the gene structures of the CCDs were highly conserved across some different lineage species. Through functional divergence analysis, a substantial divergence was found between CCD subfamilies. In addition, examination of the site-specific profile revealed the critical amino acid residues accounting for functional divergence. This study mainly focused on the evolution of CCD genes and their functional divergence which may deliver an initial step for further experimental verifications.

25035499	Ancient hybridizations among the ancestral genomes of bread wheat.	2014	Science	The allohexaploid bread wheat genome consists of three closely related subgenomes (A, B, and D), but a clear understanding of their phylogenetic history has been lacking. We used genome assemblies of bread wheat and five diploid relatives to analyze genome-wide samples of gene trees, as well as to estimate evolutionary relatedness and divergence times. We show that the A and B genomes diverged from a common ancestor ~7 million years ago and that these genomes gave rise to the D genome through homoploid hybrid speciation 1 to 2 million years later. Our findings imply that the present-day bread wheat genome is a product of multiple rounds of hybrid speciation (homoploid and polyploid) and lay the foundation for a new framework for understanding the wheat genome as a multilevel phylogenetic mosaic.
24766890	Plant PRRs and the activation of innate immune signaling.	2014	Mol Cell	Despite being sessile organisms constantly exposed to potential pathogens and pests, plants are surprisingly resilient to infections. Plants can detect invaders via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Plant PRRs are surface-localized receptor-like kinases, which comprise a ligand-binding ectodomain and an intracellular kinase domain, or receptor-like proteins, which do not exhibit any known intracellular signaling domain. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries that shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand perception and subsequent activation of plant PRRs. Notably, plant PRRs appear as central components of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane that contain additional transmembrane and cytosolic kinases required for the initiation and specificity of immune signaling. PRR complexes are under tight control by protein phosphatases, E3 ligases, and other regulatory proteins, illustrating the exquisite and complex regulation of these molecular machines whose proper activation underlines a crucial layer of plant immunity.
24395252	Grass flower development.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	Grasses bear unique flowers lacking obvious petals and sepals in special inflorescence units, the florets and the spikelet. Despite this, grass floral organs such as stamens and lodicules (petal homologs) are specified by ABC homeotic genes encoding MADS domain transcription factors, suggesting that the ABC model of eudicot flower development is largely applicable to grass flowers. However, some modifications need to be made for the model to fit grasses well: for example, a YABBY gene plays an important role in carpel specification. In addition, a number of genes are involved in the development of the lateral organs that constitute the spikelet. In this review, we discuss recent progress in elucidating the genes required for flower and spikelet development in grasses, together with those involved in fate determination of the spikelet and flower meristems.
23895552	Shared and distinct functions of two Gti1/Pac2 family proteins in growth, morphogenesis and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	Environ Microbiol	Gti1/Pac2 are conserved family proteins that regulate morphogenic transition in yeasts such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans, and they also control toxin production and pathogenicity in filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum. To test the functions of Gti1/Pac2 paralogues MoGti1 and MoPac2 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, we generated respective ΔMogti1 and ΔMopac2 mutant strains. We found that MoGti1 and MoPac2 exhibit shared and distinct roles in hyphal growth, conidiation, sexual reproduction, stress responses, surface hydrophobility, invasive hyphal growth and pathogenicity. Consistent with the putative conserved function of MoGti1, we showed that MoGti1-GFP is localized to the nucleus, whereas MoPac2-GFP is mainly found in the cytoplasm. In addition, we provided evidence that the nuclear localization of MoGti1 could be subject to regulation by MoPmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, we found that the reduced pathogenicity in the ΔMopac2 mutant corresponds with an increased expression of plant defence genes, including PR1a, AOS2, LOX1, PAD4, and CHT1. Taken together, our studies provide a comprehensive analysis of two similar but distinct Gti1/Pac2 family proteins in M. oryzae, which underlines the important yet conserved functions of these family proteins in plant pathogenic fungi.
24739238	Isolation, in silico characterization, localization and expression analysis of abiotic stress-responsive rice G-protein β subunit (RGB1).	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Heterotrimeric G-proteins constitute the classical signaling paradigm along with their cognate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and appropriate downstream effectors. G-protein complex is composed of highly conserved Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. In the present study, we have characterized the cis-regulatory elements of the promoter, signature motifs, transcript profile in response to abiotic stresses, and sub-cellular localization of G-protein β subunit RGB1(I) from Indica rice. The RGB1(I) promoter sequence has various stress-related cis-regulatory elements suggesting its role in abiotic stress signaling. Presence of six WD-40 repeat signature motifs in RGB1(I) suggest its role in exchange of GDP by GTP in Gα subunit and receptor recognition. Presence of multiple N-myristoylation consensus sites in RGB1(I) protein sequence, which is necessary for membrane localization of protein, confirms the association of RGB1(I) in plasma membrane. Extrinsic association of RGB1(I) with plasma membrane seems essential for its role in regulation of signaling pathways and adaptation to high salt stress. We report the sub-cellular localization of RGB1(I) in plasma membrane, cytosol and nucleus. The localization of RGB1(I) in nucleus supports its possible interaction with transcription factors regulating the expression of salt stress responsive genes. The RGB1(I) transcript was upregulated under KCl, cold, dehydration and micronutrient (Mn (2+) and Zn (2+)) stress. However, transcript variation under elevated temperature, ABA, NaCl, and toxic heavy metals (viz. arsenite, arsenate, cadmium and lead) was not encouraging. These evidences indicate an active and significant role of RGB1(I) in the regulation of abiotic stresses in rice and propound its possible exploitation in the development of abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
24173818	Accumulation and translocation of 198Hg in four crop species.	2014	Environ Toxicol Chem	The uptake and transport of mercury (Hg) through vegetation play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of Hg. However, quantitative information regarding Hg translocation in plants is poorly understood. In the present study, Hg uptake, accumulation, and translocation in 4 crops-rice (Oryza.sativa L.), wheat (Triticum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.)-grown in Hoagland solution were investigated using a stable isotope ((198)Hg) tracing technique. The distribution of (198)Hg in root, stem, and leaf after uptake was quantified, and the release of (198)Hg into the air from crop leaf was investigated. It was found that the concentration of Hg accumulated in the root, stem, and leaf of rice increased linearly with the spiked (198)Hg concentration. The uptake equilibrium constant was estimated to be 2.35 mol Hg/g dry weight in rice root per mol/L Hg remaining in the Hoagland solution. More than 94% of (198)Hg uptake was accumulated in the roots for all 4 crops examined. The translocation to stem and leaf was not significant because of the absence of Hg(2+) complexes that facilitate Hg transport in plants. The accumulated (198)Hg in stem and leaf was not released from the plant at air Hg(0) concentration ranging from 0 ng/m(3) to 10 ng/m(3). Transfer factor data analysis showed that Hg translocation from stems to leaves was more efficient than that from roots to stems.
24518308	Comparison of aroma active and sulfur volatiles in three fragrant rice cultivars using GC-olfactometry and GC-PFPD.	2014	Food Chem	Aroma volatiles from three cooked fragrant rice types (Jasmine, Basmati and Jasmati) were characterised and identified using SPME GC-O, GC-PFPD and confirmed using GC-MS. A total of 26, 23, and 22 aroma active volatiles were observed in Jasmine, Basmati and Jasmati cooked rice samples. 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline was aroma active in all three rice types, but the sulphur-based, cooked rice character impact volatile, 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline was aroma active only in Jasmine rice. Five additional sulphur volatiles were found to have aroma activity: dimethyl sulphide, 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, dimethyl trisulphide, and methional. Other newly-reported aroma active rice volatiles were geranyl acetate, β-damascone, β-damascenone, and ɑ-ionone, contributing nutty, sweet floral attributes to the aroma of cooked aromatic rice. The first two principal components from the principal component analysis of sulphur volatiles explained 60% of the variance. PC1 separated Basmati from the other two cultivars and PC2 completely separated Jasmine from Jasmati cultivars.
24791420	Role of gamma-oryzanol in drought-tolerant and susceptible cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Indian J Biochem Biophys	Drought-tolerant cultivars and their phytochemical composition, which has a role in providing drought tolerance are gaining importance. In this study, rice bran oil and semi-purified oryzanol (SPO) obtained from five rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, namely P1401 and PB1 (drought-susceptible) and N22, PNR381 and APO (drought-tolerant) were analyzed for the gamma-oryzanol content, an antioxidant present in considerable amount in the rice bran. The higher level of gamma-oryzanol and its antioxidant activity was observed in drought-tolerant cultivars (N22, PNR381 and APO) as compared to drought-susceptible (PB1 and P1401), suggesting the role of gamma-oryzanol in drought tolerance, as antioxidants are known to play an important role by scavenging free radicals. The total antioxidant activity of gamma-oryzanol might be attributed to 24-methylene cycloartanyl ferulate, a major component of gamma-oryzanol. By enhancing the level of active oryzanol components identified in this study by genetic and molecular means could impart increased drought tolerance.
24444958	Characteristics of the starch fine structure and pasting properties of waxy rice during storage.	2014	Food Chem	Two waxy rice (TNW1 and TCSW1, exhibiting high and low amylase activity, respectively), were stored at 4 and 17 °C (polished rice) and at room temperature (paddy rice) for 15 months. The fine structure of starch isolated from the aged rice and the pasting properties of starch and rice flour were studied. After storage, the percentage of short amylopectin (AP) chains increased in TNW1, and no uniform changing pattern was observed in the chain-length (CL) distribution of TCSW1. The viscosity of starch isolated from the aged rice increased as the storage temperature and duration increased. We hypothesised that this increase was due to the hydrolysis of AP by endogenous amylase and the generation of small clusters during storage, which caused the simple dissociation of AP and a high swelling degree of starch granules during gelatinisation. Factor analysis of the first two factors associated with the characteristics of viscograms and the CL of AP explained 72% of the total variation.
24846922	[Cloning of a rice male sterility gene by a modified MutMap method].	2014	Yi Chuan	A pollen defective male sterile rice mutant, osms55, was isolated from an elite indica cultivar HHZ using EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) mutagenesis strategy. Genetic analysis showed that osms55 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Genome-wide SNP analysis using the high-throughput Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP (50 K) microarray technology indicated that the genetic makeup of osms55 is the same as wild type (WT) HHZ. Using a modified MutMap method, we successfully identified a mutation in the LOC_Os02g40450 (MER3) gene that is co-segregated with the male sterility phenotype. The mutation is located at the intron splice-recognition site, leading to a 15 nucleotide deletion in the fifth exon. Different from the published MutMap method that aligns the mutant pool DNA sequence with the assembled WT genome, the method used in this study was to align the re-sequencing data of the mutant pool DNA and WT HHZ with the Nipponbare reference genome. The resulting SNPs of mutant/Nipponbare and WT HHZ/Nipponbare were further compared to determine the candidate mutant gene. This modified method does not need an assembled WT genome as reference and thus is more cost-effective and widely applicable.
24846967	[Phylogenetic analysis of DNA demethylase genes in angiosperm].	2014	Yi Chuan	The DNA methylation patterns and levels are depended on the function of DNA methyltransferase and DNA demethylase, and DNA demethylase plays a critical role in active DNA demethylation. In this paper, all homologous DNA demethylase gene copies were identified in monocots (O. sativa and S. bicolor) and dicotyledon (A.thaliana and P. trichocarpa) based on ten known DNA demethylase genes from rice and Arabidopsis. Two types of new DNA demethy-lase-like genes (DML4 and DML5) were identified. Tandem duplication, segmental duplication and whole genome duplica-tion exist in DNA demethylase gene family in plants, which result in neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization upon the phylogeny of conserved glycosylase domains and chromosomal locations of genes. Furthermore, the expression of DNA demethylase genes was investigated in different tissues. This study will facilitate our understanding of the relationship be-tween function and evolution of DNA demethylase, and utilizing the DNA demethylase genes in plants.
24206686	An innovative and integrated approach based on DNA walking to identify unauthorised GMOs.	2014	Food Chem	In the coming years, the frequency of unauthorised genetically modified organisms (GMOs) being present in the European food and feed chain will increase significantly. Therefore, we have developed a strategy to identify unauthorised GMOs containing a pCAMBIA family vector, frequently present in transgenic plants. This integrated approach is performed in two successive steps on Bt rice grains. First, the potential presence of unauthorised GMOs is assessed by the qPCR SYBR®Green technology targeting the terminator 35S pCAMBIA element. Second, its presence is confirmed via the characterisation of the junction between the transgenic cassette and the rice genome. To this end, a DNA walking strategy is applied using a first reverse primer followed by two semi-nested PCR rounds using primers that are each time nested to the previous reverse primer. This approach allows to rapidly identify the transgene flanking region and can easily be implemented by the enforcement laboratories.
18291034	Genome-wide analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLtp) gene families and identification of wheat nsLtp genes by EST data mining.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are encoded by multigene families and possess physiological functions that remain unclear. Our objective was to characterize the complete nsLtp gene family in rice and arabidopsis and to perform wheat EST database mining for nsLtp gene discovery.

RESULTS: In this study, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of nsLtp gene families in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana and identified 52 rice nsLtp genes and 49 arabidopsis nsLtp genes. Here we present a complete overview of the genes and deduced protein features. Tandem duplication repeats, which represent 26 out of the 52 rice nsLtp genes and 18 out of the 49 arabidopsis nsLtp genes identified, support the complexity of the nsLtp gene families in these species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice and arabidopsis nsLTPs are clustered in nine different clades. In addition, we performed comparative analysis of rice nsLtp genes and wheat (Triticum aestivum) EST sequences indexed in the UniGene database. We identified 156 putative wheat nsLtp genes, among which 91 were found in the 'Chinese Spring' cultivar. The 122 wheat non-redundant nsLTPs were organized in eight types and 33 subfamilies. Based on the observation that seven of these clades were present in arabidopsis, rice and wheat, we conclude that the major functional diversification within the nsLTP family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. In contrast, there is no type VII nsLTPs in arabidopsis and type IX nsLTPs were only identified in arabidopsis. The reason for the larger number of nsLtp genes in wheat may simply be due to the hexaploid state of wheat but may also reflect extensive duplication of gene clusters as observed on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and arabidopsis chromosome 5.

CONCLUSION: Our current study provides fundamental information on the organization of the rice, arabidopsis and wheat nsLtp gene families. The multiplicity of nsLTP types provide new insights on arabidopsis, rice and wheat nsLtp gene families and will strongly support further transcript profiling or functional analyses of nsLtp genes. Until such time as specific physiological functions are defined, it seems relevant to categorize plant nsLTPs on the basis of sequence similarity and/or phylogenetic clustering.
18182435	Phylogenetic and functional analysis of Arabidopsis RCI2 genes.	2007	J Exp Bot	Six new Arabidopsis thaliana genes (AtRCI2C-H) have been identified that show high homology to AtRCI2A and AtRCI2B. Sequence comparisons revealed that AtRCI2-related genes are widely spread among very different organisms, including other plant species, prokaryotes, fungi, and simply organized animals, and are also organized in gene families. Most RCI2 genes show a similar exon-intron organization, which indicates that they have been structurally conserved during evolution, and encode small, highly hydrophobic proteins containing two putative transmembrane domains. Consistently, the majority of AtRCI2 proteins localize in the plasma membrane. RCI2 proteins exhibit an elevated level of sequence similarity and seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. In spite of their high similarity, conserved subcellular localization, and common origin, experimental evidence is presented suggesting that different RCI2 proteins may have distinct functional roles. Thus, as previously demonstrated for AtRCI2A and AtRCI2B, the newly identified AtRCI2 genes (AtRCI2C-H) are differentially regulated in Arabidopsis organs and in response to abiotic stresses and ABA treatment. Furthermore, only the AtRCI2 proteins that do not contain the C-terminal hydrophilic tail (i.e. AtRCI2A-C and AtRCI2H) are able to complement for the loss of the yeast AtRCI2-related gene PMP3. On the basis of these results, different aspects on the evolution and roles of RCI2 genes are discussed.
17033811	Genome-wide analysis of the stress associated protein (SAP) gene family containing A20/AN1 zinc-finger(s) in rice and their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Proteins with the A20/AN1 zinc-finger domain are present in all eukaryotes and are well characterized in animals, but little is known about their function in plants. Earlier, we have identified an A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress associated protein 1 gene (SAP1) in rice and validated its function in abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, genome-wide survey of genes encoding proteins possessing A20/AN1 zinc-finger, named SAP gene family, has been carried out in rice and Arabidopsis. The genomic distribution and gene architecture as well as domain structure and phylogenetic relationship of encoded proteins numbering 18 and 14 in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, have been studied. Expression analysis of the rice SAP family was done to investigate their response under abiotic stress conditions. All the genes were inducible by one or the other abiotic stresses indicating that the OsSAP gene family is an important component of stress response in rice. Manipulation of their expression and identification of their superior alleles should help confer stress tolerance in target crops.
19850038	OsBADH1 is possibly involved in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes.	2009	FEBS Lett	Although rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces little glycine betaine (GB), it has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH; EC 1.2.1.8) gene homologs (OsBADH1 and OsBADH2). We found that OsBADH1 catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde efficiently, while the activity of OsBADH2 is extremely low. The accumulation of OsBADH1 mRNA decreases following submergence treatment, but quickly recovers after re-aeration. We confirmed that OsBADH1 localizes in peroxisomes. In this paper, a possible physiological function of OsBADH1 in the oxidation of acetaldehyde produced by catalase in rice plant peroxisomes is discussed.
20937895	Local DNA hypomethylation activates genes in rice endosperm.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cytosine methylation silences transposable elements in plants, vertebrates, and fungi but also regulates gene expression. Plant methylation is catalyzed by three families of enzymes, each with a preferred sequence context: CG, CHG (H = A, C, or T), and CHH, with CHH methylation targeted by the RNAi pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm, a placenta-like tissue that nourishes the embryo, is globally hypomethylated in the CG context while retaining high non-CG methylation. Global methylation dynamics in seeds of cereal crops that provide the bulk of human nutrition remain unknown. Here, we show that rice endosperm DNA is hypomethylated in all sequence contexts. Non-CG methylation is reduced evenly across the genome, whereas CG hypomethylation is localized. CHH methylation of small transposable elements is increased in embryos, suggesting that endosperm demethylation enhances transposon silencing. Genes preferentially expressed in endosperm, including those coding for major storage proteins and starch synthesizing enzymes, are frequently hypomethylated in endosperm, indicating that DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of rice endosperm biogenesis. Our data show that genome-wide reshaping of seed DNA methylation is conserved among angiosperms and has a profound effect on gene expression in cereal crops.
20421740	Investigating the function of CAF1 deadenylases during plant stress responses.	2010	Plant Signal Behav	Alteration of gene expression plays a central role in the transmission of developmental and environmental signals. The steady-state transcript level within a cell is determined by the combination of the rate synthesis and the rate of degradation. While altering the rate of mRNA turnover is known to provide a rapid mechanism to reprogram transcript levels, research has largely focused on changes in transcriptional regulation as a mechanism to control mRNA levels. However, recent studies have begun to explore the role of mRNA decay in reprogramming the transcriptome.
25194027	Genome-wide study of KNOX regulatory network reveals brassinosteroid catabolic genes important for shoot meristem function in rice.	2014	Plant Cell	In flowering plants, knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors play crucial roles in establishment and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs such as leaves, stems, and flowers initiate. We report that a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) represses the brassinosteroid (BR) phytohormone pathway through activation of BR catabolism genes. Inducible overexpression of OSH1 caused BR insensitivity, whereas loss of function showed a BR-overproduction phenotype. Genome-wide identification of loci bound and regulated by OSH1 revealed hormonal and transcriptional regulation as the major function of OSH1. Among these targets, BR catabolism genes CYP734A2, CYP734A4, and CYP734A6 were rapidly upregulated by OSH1 induction. Furthermore, RNA interference knockdown plants of CYP734A genes arrested growth of the SAM and mimicked some osh1 phenotypes. Thus, we suggest that local control of BR levels by KNOX genes is a key regulatory step in SAM function.

17363107	Four glucosyltransferases from rice: cDNA cloning, expression, and characterization.	2008	J Plant Physiol	Four UDP-dependent glucosyltransferase (UGT) genes, UGT706C1, UGT706D1, UGT707A3, and UGT709A4 were cloned from rice, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. In order to find out whether these enzymes could use flavonoids as glucose acceptors, apigenin, daidzein, genistein, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, and quercetin were used as potential glucose acceptors. UGT706C1 and UGT707A3 could use kaempferol and quercetin as glucose acceptors and the major glycosylation position was the hydroxyl group of carbon 3 based on the comparison of HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and NMR spectra with those of corresponding authentic flavonoid 3-O-glucosides. On the other hand, UGT709A4 only used the isoflavonoids genistein and daidzein and transferred glucose onto 7-hydroxyl group. In addition, UGT706D1 used a broad range of flavonoids including flavone, flavanone, flavonol, and isoflavone, and produced at least two products with glycosylation at different hydroxyl groups. Based on their substrate preferences and the flavonoids present in rice, the in vivo function of UGT706C1, UGT706D1, and UGT707A3 is most likely the biosynthesis of kaempferol and quercetin glucosides.
20590996	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development.	2010	J Integr Plant Biol	In higher plants, male reproductive development is a complex biological process that includes cell division and differentiation, cell to cell communication etc., while the mechanism underlying plant male reproductive development remains less understood. GAMYB encodes a gibberellins acid (GA) inducible transcription factor that is required for the early anther development in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new allele gamyb-4 with a C base deletion in the second exon (+2308), causing a frame shift and premature translational termination. Histological analysis showed that gamyb-4 developed abnormal enlarged tapetum and could not undergo normal meiosis. To understand the regulatory role of GAMYB, we carried out quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and comparison of microarray data. These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1). While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development. This work is helpful in understanding the regulatory network in rice anther development.
23025662	Molecular control of male reproductive development and pollen fertility in rice.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Anther development and male fertility are essential biological processes for flowering plants and are important for crop seed production. Genetic manipulation of male fertility/sterility is critical for crop hybrid breeding. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) male sterility phenotypes, including genic male sterility, hybrid male sterility, and cytoplasmic male sterility, are generally caused by mutations of fertility-related genes, by incompatible interactions between divergent allelic or non-allelic genes, or by genetic incompatibilities between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes. Here, we review the recent advances in the molecular basis of anther development and male fertility-sterility conversion in specific genetic backgrounds, and the interactions with certain environmental factors. The highlighted findings in this review have significant implications in both basic studies and rice genetic improvement.
24131983	Molecular mechanism of strigolactone perception by DWARF14.	2013	Nat Commun	Strigolactones (SLs) are phytohormones that inhibit shoot branching and function in the rhizospheric communication with symbiotic fungi and parasitic weeds. An α/β-hydrolase protein, DWARF14 (D14), has been recognized to be an essential component of plant SL signalling, although its precise function remains unknown. Here we present the SL-dependent interaction of D14 with a gibberellin signalling repressor SLR1 and a possible mechanism of phytohormone perception in D14-mediated SL signalling. D14 functions as a cleavage enzyme of SLs, and the cleavage reaction induces the interaction with SLR1. The crystal structure of D14 shows that 5-hydroxy-3-methylbutenolide (D-OH), which is a reaction product of SLs, is trapped in the catalytic cavity of D14 to form an altered surface. The D14 residues recognizing D-OH are critical for the SL-dependent D14-SLR1 interaction. These results provide new insight into crosstalk between gibberellin and SL signalling pathways.
21788985	Plant ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and its role in gibberellin signaling.	2011	Cell Res	The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in plants, like in other eukaryotes, targets numerous intracellular regulators and thus modulates almost every aspect of growth and development. The well-known and best-characterized outcome of ubiquitination is mediating target protein degradation via the 26S proteasome, which represents the major selective protein degradation pathway conserved among eukaryotes. In this review, we will discuss the molecular composition, regulation and function of plant UPS, with a major focus on how DELLA protein degradation acts as a key in gibberellin signal transduction and its implication in the regulation of plant growth.
15491922	Plant heterotrimeric G protein function: insights from Arabidopsis and rice mutants.	2004	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in a wide range of plant processes. These include responses to hormones, drought, and pathogens, and developmental events such as lateral root formation, hypocotyl elongation, hook opening, leaf expansion, and silique development. Results and concepts emerging from recent phenotypic analyses of G-protein component mutants in Arabidopsis and rice are adding to our understanding of G-protein mechanisms and functions in higher plants.
17470057	Patterns of gene duplication in the plant SKP1 gene family in angiosperms: evidence for multiple mechanisms of rapid gene birth.	2007	Plant J	Gene duplication plays important roles in organismal evolution, because duplicate genes provide raw materials for the evolution of mechanisms controlling physiological and/or morphological novelties. Gene duplication can occur via several mechanisms, including segmental duplication, tandem duplication and retroposition. Although segmental and tandem duplications have been found to be important for the expansion of a number of multigene families, the contribution of retroposition is not clear. Here we show that plant SKP1 genes have evolved by multiple duplication events from a single ancestral copy in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of eudicots and monocots, resulting in 19 ASK (Arabidopsis SKP1-like) and 28 OSK (Oryza SKP1-like) genes. The estimated birth rates are more than ten times the average rate of gene duplication, and are even higher than that of other rapidly duplicating plant genes, such as type I MADS box genes, R genes, and genes encoding receptor-like kinases. Further analyses suggest that a relatively large proportion of the duplication events may be explained by tandem duplication, but few, if any, are likely to be due to segmental duplication. In addition, by mapping the gain/loss of a specific intron on gene phylogenies, and by searching for the features that characterize retrogenes/retrosequences, we show that retroposition is an important mechanism for expansion of the plant SKP1 gene family. Specifically, we propose that two and three ancient retroposition events occurred in lineages leading to Arabidopsis and rice, respectively, followed by repeated tandem duplications and chromosome rearrangements. Our study represents a thorough investigation showing that retroposition can play an important role in the evolution of a plant gene family whose members do not encode mobile elements.
19120446	Characterization of the rice carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 reveals a novel route for geranial biosynthesis.	2009	FEBS J	Carotenoid cleavage products--apocarotenoids--include biologically active compounds, such as hormones, pigments and volatiles. Their biosynthesis is initiated by the oxidative cleavage of C-C double bonds in carotenoid backbones, leading to aldehydes and/or ketones. This step is catalyzed by carotenoid oxygenases, which constitute an ubiquitous enzyme family, including the group of plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 1 (CCD1s), which mediates the formation of volatile C(13) ketones, such as beta-ionone, by cleaving the C9-C10 and C9'-C10' double bonds of cyclic and acyclic carotenoids. Recently, it was reported that plant CCD1s also act on the C5-C6/C5'-C6' double bonds of acyclic carotenes, leading to the volatile C(8) ketone 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we show here that rice CCD1 converts lycopene into the three different volatiles, pseudoionone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and geranial (C(10)), suggesting that the C7-C8/C7'-C8' double bonds of acyclic carotenoid ends constitute a novel cleavage site for the CCD1 plant subfamily. The results were confirmed by HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS analyses, and further substantiated by in vitro incubations with the monocyclic carotenoid 3-OH-gamma-carotene and with linear synthetic substrates. Bicyclic carotenoids were cleaved, as reported for other plant CCD1s, at the C9-C10 and C9'-C10' double bonds. Our study reveals a novel source for the widely occurring plant volatile geranial, which is the cleavage of noncyclic ends of carotenoids.
19767386	Metabolite sorting of a germplasm collection reveals the hydroxylase3 locus as a new target for maize provitamin A biofortification.	2009	Plant Physiol	Vitamin A deficiency, a global health burden, can be alleviated through provitamin A carotenoid biofortification of major crop staples such as maize (Zea mays) and other grasses in the Poaceae. If regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis was better understood, enhancement could be controlled by limiting beta-carotene hydroxylation to compounds with lower or no nonprovitamin A activity. Natural maize genetic diversity enabled identification of hydroxylation genes associated with reduced endosperm provitamin A content. A novel approach was used to capture the genetic and biochemical diversity of a large germplasm collection, representing 80% of maize genetic diversity, without having to sample the entire collection. Metabolite data sorting was applied to select a 10-line genetically diverse subset representing biochemical extremes for maize kernel carotenoids. Transcript profiling led to discovery of the Hydroxylase3 locus that coincidently mapped to a carotene quantitative trait locus, thereby prompting investigation of allelic variation in a broader collection. Three natural alleles in 51 maize lines explained 78% of variation and approximately 11-fold difference in beta-carotene relative to beta-cryptoxanthin and 36% of the variation and 4-fold difference in absolute levels of beta-carotene. A simple PCR assay to track and identify Hydroxylase3 alleles will be valuable for predicting nutritional content in genetically diverse cultivars found worldwide.
21828105	Achievements and challenges in understanding plant abiotic stress responses and tolerance.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Intensive research over the last decade has gradually unraveled the mechanisms that underlie how plants react to environmental adversity. Genes involved in many of the essential steps of the stress response have been identified and characterized. In particular, the recent discovery of ABA receptors, progress in understanding the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of stress-responsive gene expression, and studies on hormone interactions under stress have facilitated addressing the molecular basis of how plant cells respond to abiotic stress. Here, we summarize recent research progress on these issues, especially focusing on progress related to the essential and classically important signaling pathways and genes. Despite this wealth of achievements, many challenges remain not only for the further elucidation of stress response mechanisms but also for evaluation of the natural genetic variations and associating them with specific gene functions. Finally, the proper application of this knowledge to benefit humans and agriculture is another important issue that lies ahead. Collaborative wisdom and efforts are needed to confront these challenges.
25230811	Targeting MAGO proteins with a peptide aptamer reinforces their essential roles in multiple rice developmental pathways.	2014	Plant J	Peptide aptamers are artificial short peptides that potentially interfere with the biological roles of their target proteins; however, this technology has not yet been applied to plant functional genomics. MAGO and Y14, the two core subunits of the exon junction complex (EJC), form obligate heterodimers in eukaryotes. In Oryza sativa L. (rice), each of the two genes has two homologs, designated OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2, and OsY14a and OsY14b, respectively. Here, we characterized a 16-amino acida peptide aptamer (PAP) for the rice MAGO proteins. PAP and rice Y14 bound competitively to rice MAGO proteins. Specifically targeting the MAGO proteins by expressing the aptamer in transgenic rice plants did not affect the endogenous synthesis and accumulation of MAGO proteins; however, the phenotypic variations observed in multiple organs phenocopied those of transgenic rice plants harboring RNA interference (RNAi) constructs in which the accumulation of MAGO and/or OsY14a transcripts and MAGO proteins was downregulated severely. Morphologically, the aptamer transgenic plants were short with abnormally developed flowers, and the stamens exhibited reduced degradation and absorption of both the endothecium and tapetum, thus confirming that EJC core heterodimers play essential roles in rice development, growth and reproduction. This study reveals that as a complementary approach of RNAi, peptide aptamers are powerful tools for interfering with the function of proteins in higher plants.
19682292	Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling.	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Development of genetic varieties with improved nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is essential for sustainable agriculture. In this study, we developed a growth system for rice wherein N was the growth-limiting factor, and identified N-responsive genes by a whole genome transcriptional profiling approach. Some genes were selected to test their functionality in NUE by a transgenic approach. One such example with positive effects on NUE is an early nodulin gene OsENOD93-1. This OsENOD93-1 gene responded significantly to both N induction and N reduction. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield. This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria. Transgenic plants accumulated higher concentrations of total amino acids and total N in roots. A higher concentration of amino acids in xylem sap was detected in transgenic plants, especially under N stress. In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93-1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis. This work demonstrates that transcriptional profiling, coupled with a transgenic validation approach, is an effective strategy for gene discovery. The knowledge gained from this study could be applied to other important crops.
25535376	Rare allele of a previously unidentified histone H4 acetyltransferase enhances grain weight, yield, and plant biomass in rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Grain weight is an important crop yield component; however, its underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identify a grain-weight quantitative trait locus (QTL) encoding a new-type GNAT-like protein that harbors intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (OsglHAT1). Our genetic and molecular evidences pinpointed the QTL-OsglHAT1's allelic variations to a 1.2-kb region upstream of the gene body, which is consistent with its function as a positive regulator of the traits. Elevated OsglHAT1 expression enhances grain weight and yield by enlarging spikelet hulls via increasing cell number and accelerating grain filling, and increases global acetylation levels of histone H4. OsglHAT1 localizes to the nucleus, where it likely functions through the regulation of transcription. Despite its positive agronomical effects on grain weight, yield, and plant biomass, the rare allele elevating OsglHAT1 expression has so far escaped human selection. Our findings reveal the first example, to our knowledge, of a QTL for a yield component trait being due to a chromatin modifier that has the potential to improve crop high-yield breeding.

25301663	Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate lowers the effect of cadmium-induced oxidative injury in rice seedlings.	2014	Phytochemistry	Rice seedlings grown under 50 μM cadmium alone or in combination with 5 μM methyl jasmonate were investigated for Cd-induced oxidative injury at 3, 7 and 10 days of treatment. MeJA treatments alone did not have any significant change in antioxidant enzyme activities or levels of H2O2 and O2(·-) in roots/shoots, as compared to controls during 3-10 days. The Cd-stressed plants When supplemented with exogenous MeJA revealed significant and consistent changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, POD and GR paralleled with an increased GSH-pools than that in plants subjected to Cd-stress alone. Synthesis of GSH driven by increasing demand for GSH in response to Cd-induced oxidative stress in rice was evident. Increased activity of LOX under Cd-stress was noted. Results suggest enhanced Cd-tolerance, lowered Cd(2+) uptake, an improved membrane integrity and 'switching on' of the JA-biosynthesis by LOX in the Cd-stressed rice roots/shoots exposed to MeJA. Exposure to MeJA improved antioxidant response and accumulation of antioxidants which perhaps lowered the Cd-induced oxidative stress in rice. It is this switching on/off of the JA-biosynthesis and ROS mediated signal transduction pathway involving glutathione homeostasis via GR which helps MeJA to mitigate Cd-induced oxidative injury in rice.
25278554	Crossover formation during rice meiosis relies on interaction of OsMSH4 and OsMSH5.	2014	Genetics	MSH4 encodes a MutS protein that plays a specialized role in meiosis. In eukaryotic species, such as budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis, msh4 mutants display meiotic defects with a reduced number of chiasmata. Here, we characterized rice MSH4 by map-based cloning. In Osmsh4 mutants, the chiasma frequency was dramatically decreased to ∼10% of the wild type, but the synaptonemal complex was normally installed. The double mutant analysis showed that in the Osmsh4 Osmsh5 mutant, the reduction of chiasmata was greater than other zmm mutants. This was consistent with the absence of localization for OsZIP4 and OsMER3 in Osmsh4 and suggests an earlier role for OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 than other ZMM proteins where they may be required to stabilize progenitor Holliday junctions. Using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, we verified the direct physical association between OsMSH4 and OsMSH5 and OsMSH5 and HEI10 in plants for the first time. The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs). We propose that OsMSH4 interacts with OsMSH5 to promote formation of the majority of COs in rice.
25352666	A plausible mechanism, based upon Short-Root movement, for regulating the number of cortex cell layers in roots.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Formation of specialized cells and tissues at defined times and in specific positions is essential for the development of multicellular organisms. Often this developmental precision is achieved through intercellular signaling networks, which establish patterns of differential gene expression and ultimately the specification of distinct cell fates. Here we address the question of how the Short-root (SHR) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSHR), Brachypodium distachyon (BdSHR), and Oryza sativa (OsSHR1 and OsSHR2) function in patterning the root ground tissue. We find that all of the SHR proteins function as mobile signals in A. thaliana and all of the SHR homologs physically interact with the AtSHR binding protein, Scarecow (SCR). Unlike AtSHR, movement of the SHR homologs was not limited to the endodermis. Instead, the SHR proteins moved multiple cell layers and determined the number of cortex, not endodermal, cell layers formed in the root. Our results in A. thaliana are consistent with a mechanism by which the regulated movement of the SHR transcription factor determines the number of cortex cell layers produced in the roots of B. distachyon and O. sativa. These data also provide a new model for ground tissue patterning in A. thaliana in which the ability to form a functional endodermis is spatially limited independently of SHR.

25331872	A rice ABC transporter, OsABCC1, reduces arsenic accumulation in the grain.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Arsenic (As) is a chronic poison that causes severe skin lesions and cancer. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major dietary source of As; therefore, reducing As accumulation in the rice grain and thereby diminishing the amount of As that enters the food chain is of critical importance. Here, we report that a member of the Oryza sativa C-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (OsABCC) family, OsABCC1, is involved in the detoxification and reduction of As in rice grains. We found that OsABCC1 was expressed in many organs, including the roots, leaves, nodes, peduncle, and rachis. Expression was not affected when plants were exposed to low levels of As but was up-regulated in response to high levels of As. In both the basal nodes and upper nodes, which are connected to the panicle, OsABCC1 was localized to the phloem region of vascular bundles. Furthermore, OsABCC1 was localized to the tonoplast and conferred phytochelatin-dependent As resistance in yeast. Knockout of OsABCC1 in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to As, but did not affect cadmium toxicity. At the reproductive growth stage, the As content was higher in the nodes and in other tissues of wild-type rice than in those of OsABCC1 knockout mutants, but was significantly lower in the grain. Taken together, our results indicate that OsABCC1 limits As transport to the grains by sequestering As in the vacuoles of the phloem companion cells of the nodes in rice.

25368197	Rapid diversification of five Oryza AA genomes associated with rice adaptation.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Comparative genomic analyses among closely related species can greatly enhance our understanding of plant gene and genome evolution. We report de novo-assembled AA-genome sequences for Oryza nivara, Oryza glaberrima, Oryza barthii, Oryza glumaepatula, and Oryza meridionalis. Our analyses reveal massive levels of genomic structural variation, including segmental duplication and rapid gene family turnover, with particularly high instability in defense-related genes. We show, on a genomic scale, how lineage-specific expansion or contraction of gene families has led to their morphological and reproductive diversification, thus enlightening the evolutionary process of speciation and adaptation. Despite strong purifying selective pressures on most Oryza genes, we documented a large number of positively selected genes, especially those genes involved in flower development, reproduction, and resistance-related processes. These diversifying genes are expected to have played key roles in adaptations to their ecological niches in Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. Extensive variation in noncoding RNA gene numbers, function enrichment, and rates of sequence divergence might also help account for the different genetic adaptations of these rice species. Collectively, these resources provide new opportunities for evolutionary genomics, numerous insights into recent speciation, a valuable database of functional variation for crop improvement, and tools for efficient conservation of wild rice germplasm.
25368149	Recent climate and air pollution impacts on Indian agriculture.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Recent research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has primarily focused on the roles of temperature and precipitation. These studies show that India has already been negatively affected by recent climate trends. However, anthropogenic climate changes are a result of both global emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Two potent SLCPs, tropospheric ozone and black carbon, have direct effects on crop yields beyond their indirect effects through climate; emissions of black carbon and ozone precursors have risen dramatically in India over the past three decades. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we present results of the combined effects of climate change and the direct effects of SLCPs on wheat and rice yields in India from 1980 to 2010. Our statistical model suggests that, averaged over India, yields in 2010 were up to 36% lower for wheat than they otherwise would have been, absent climate and pollutant emissions trends, with some densely populated states experiencing 50% relative yield losses. [Our point estimates for rice (-20%) are similarly large, but not statistically significant.] Upper-bound estimates suggest that an overwhelming fraction (90%) of these losses is due to the direct effects of SLCPs. Gains from addressing regional air pollution could thus counter expected future yield losses resulting from direct climate change effects of LLGHGs.
25378698	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Success of modern agriculture relies heavily on breeding of crops with maximal regional adaptability and yield potentials. A major limiting factor for crop cultivation is their flowering time, which is strongly regulated by day length (photoperiod) and temperature. Here we report identification and characterization of Days to heading 7 (DTH7), a major genetic locus underlying photoperiod sensitivity and grain yield in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod. We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the "florigen" genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering. Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions. Our data provide not only a macroscopic view of the genetic control of photoperiod sensitivity in rice but also a foundation for breeding of rice cultivars better adapted to the target environments using rational design.
25433632	Biosynthetic relationship between C₂₈-brassinosteroids and C₂₉-brassinosteroids in rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings.	2015	Phytochemistry	A crude enzyme solution was prepared from young rice seedlings, and the metabolism of C29-brassinosteroids identified from the seedlings was examined. When 28-homoteasterone was added as a substrate, 28-homotyphasterol, teasterone, and 26-nor-28-homoteasterone were characterized as enzyme products by GC-MS/SIM analysis. With 28-homotyphasterol, 28-homoteasterone, typhasterol, 28-homocastasterone, and 26-nor-28-homotyphasterol were formed and identified as products. When 28-homocastasterone was used, castasterone and 26-nor-28-homocastasterone were identified as products. Together with the reduced biological activity of C29-brassinosteroids and their metabolites in the rice lamina inclination assay, these metabolic studies suggest a biosynthetic sequence, 28-homoteasterone↔28-homotyphasterol→28-homocastasterone for C29-brassinosteroid biosynthesis is connected to the biosynthetic sequence teasterone↔typhasterol→castasterone for C28-brassinosteroids by C-28 demethylation, i.e., in order to increase biological activity in the rice plant. Additionally, the C29-brassinosteroids seem to bio-degrade their C-26 demethylated C28-brassinosteroid analogs to reduce brassinosteroid activity in planta. In conclusion, the biosynthesis of C29-brassinosteroids is a likely alternative route to the biologically-active brassinosteroid, castasterone, in rice.
25409830	Direct human influence on atmospheric CO2 seasonality from increased cropland productivity.	2014	Nature	Ground- and aircraft-based measurements show that the seasonal amplitude of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has increased by as much as 50 per cent over the past 50 years. This increase has been linked to changes in temperate, boreal and arctic ecosystem properties and processes such as enhanced photosynthesis, increased heterotrophic respiration, and expansion of woody vegetation. However, the precise causal mechanisms behind the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality remain unclear. Here we use production statistics and a carbon accounting model to show that increases in agricultural productivity, which have been largely overlooked in previous investigations, explain as much as a quarter of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonality. Specifically, Northern Hemisphere extratropical maize, wheat, rice, and soybean production grew by 240 per cent between 1961 and 2008, thereby increasing the amount of net carbon uptake by croplands during the Northern Hemisphere growing season by 0.33 petagrams. Maize alone accounts for two-thirds of this change, owing mostly to agricultural intensification within concentrated production zones in the midwestern United States and northern China. Maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans account for about 68 per cent of extratropical dry biomass production, so it is likely that the total impact of increased agricultural production exceeds the amount quantified here.
25480370	RHON1 mediates a Rho-like activity for transcription termination in plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana.	2014	Plant Cell	Although transcription termination is essential to generate functional RNAs, its underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood in plastids of vascular plants. Here, we show that the RNA binding protein RHON1 participates in transcriptional termination of rbcL (encoding large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivation of RHON1 leads to enhanced rbcL read-through transcription and to aberrant accD (encoding β-subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase) transcriptional initiation, which may result from inefficient transcription termination of rbcL. RHON1 can bind to the mRNA as well as to single-stranded DNA of rbcL, displays an RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and terminates transcription of rbcL in vitro. These results suggest that RHON1 terminates rbcL transcription using an ATP-driven mechanism similar to that of Rho of Escherichia coli. This RHON1-dependent transcription termination occurs in Arabidopsis but not in rice (Oryza sativa) and appears to reflect a fundamental difference between plastomes of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Our results point to the importance and significance of plastid transcription termination and provide insights into its machinery in an evolutionary context.
25512547	Prehistoric genomes reveal the genetic foundation and cost of horse domestication.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The domestication of the horse ∼ 5.5 kya and the emergence of mounted riding, chariotry, and cavalry dramatically transformed human civilization. However, the genetics underlying horse domestication are difficult to reconstruct, given the near extinction of wild horses. We therefore sequenced two ancient horse genomes from Taymyr, Russia (at 7.4- and 24.3-fold coverage), both predating the earliest archeological evidence of domestication. We compared these genomes with genomes of domesticated horses and the wild Przewalski's horse and found genetic structure within Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene, with the ancient population contributing significantly to the genetic variation of domesticated breeds. We furthermore identified a conservative set of 125 potential domestication targets using four complementary scans for genes that have undergone positive selection. One group of genes is involved in muscular and limb development, articular junctions, and the cardiac system, and may represent physiological adaptations to human utilization. A second group consists of genes with cognitive functions, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness, which may have been key for taming horses. We also found that domestication is associated with inbreeding and an excess of deleterious mutations. This genetic load is in line with the "cost of domestication" hypothesis also reported for rice, tomatoes, and dogs, and it is generally attributed to the relaxation of purifying selection resulting from the strong demographic bottlenecks accompanying domestication. Our work demonstrates the power of ancient genomes to reconstruct the complex genetic changes that transformed wild animals into their domesticated forms, and the population context in which this process took place.
25316064	Identification and characterization of chloroplast casein kinase II from Oryza sativa (rice).	2015	J Exp Bot	Plastid casein kinase II is an important regulator of transcription, posttranscriptional processes, and, most likely, different metabolic functions in dicotyledonous species. Here we report the identification and characterization of pCKII from the monocotyledonous species Oryza sativa. OspCKII activity was enriched from isolated rice chloroplasts using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, in which it co-elutes with the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) and several ribosomal proteins. Inclusion mass scanning of the kinase-active fraction identified the gene model for OspCKII. Transient expression of GFP fused to the 184 N-terminal amino acids of the OspCKII sequence in rice confirmed the chloroplastic localization of the kinase. OspCKII activity shows the characteristic features of casein kinase II, such as the utilization of GTP as phosphate donor, inhibition by low concentrations of heparin and poly-lysine, and utilization of the canonical pCKII motif E-S-E-G-E in the model substrate RNP29. Phosphoproteome analysis of a protein extract from rice leaves combined with a meta-analysis with published phosphoproteomics data revealed differences in the target protein spectrum between rice and Arabidopsis. Consistently, several pCKII phosphorylation sites in dicotyledonous plants are not conserved in monocots and algae, suggesting that details of pCKII regulation in plastids have changed during evolution.
25358295	Enhancement of innate immune system in monocot rice by transferring the dicotyledonous elongation factor Tu receptor EFR.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	The elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor (EFR) in cruciferous plants specifically recognizes the N-terminal acetylated elf18 region of bacterial EF-Tu and thereby activates plant immunity. It has been demonstrated that Arabidopsis EFR confers broad-spectrum bacterial resistance in the EFR transgenic solanaceous plants. Here, the transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Zhonghua 17) and cell cultures with constitutive expression of AtEFR were developed to investigate whether AtEFR senses EF-Tu and thus enhances bacterial resistance in the monocot plants. We demonstrated that the Xanthomonas oryzae-derived elf18 peptide induced oxidative burst and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the AtEFR transgenic rice cells and plants, respectively. Pathogenesis-related genes, such as OsPBZ1, were upregulated dramatically in transgenic rice plant and cell lines in response to elf18 stimulation. Importantly, pretreatment with elf18 triggered strong resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae in the transgenic plants, which was largely dependent on the AtEFR expression level. These plants also exhibited enhanced resistance to rice bacterial brown stripe, but not to rice fungal blast. Collectively, the results indicate that the rice plants with heterologous expression of AtEFR recognize bacterial EF-Tu and exhibit enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial disease resistance and that pattern recognition receptor-mediated immunity may be manipulated across the two plant classes, dicots and monocots.
25332358	Rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.4 functions in low-affinity acquisition and long-distance transport.	2015	J Exp Bot	Plant proteins belonging to the NPF (formerly NRT1/PTR) family are well represented in every genome and function in transporting a wide variety of substrates. In this study, we showed that rice OsNPF2.4 is located in the plasma membrane and is expressed mainly in the epidermis, xylem parenchyma, and phloem companion cells. Functional analysis in oocytes showed that OsNPF2.4 is a pH-dependent, low-affinity NO₃⁻ transporter. Short-term (¹⁵NO₃⁻) influx rate, long-term NO₃⁻ acquisition by root, and upward transfer from root to shoot were decreased by disruption of OsNPF2.4 and increased by OsNPF2.4 overexpression under high NO₃⁻ supply. Moreover, the redistribution of NO₃⁻ in the mutants in comparison with the wild type from the oldest leaf to other organs, particularly to N-starved roots, was dramatically changed. Knockout of OsNPF2.4 decreased rice growth and potassium (K) concentration in xylem sap, root, culm, and sheath, but increased the shoot:root ratio of tissue K under higher NO₃⁻. We conclude that OsNPF2.4 functions in acquisition and long-distance transport of NO₃⁻ , and that altering its expression has an indirect effect on K recycling between the root and shoot.
25299339	Determination of supplier-to-supplier and lot-to-lot variability in glycation of recombinant human serum albumin expressed in Oryza sativa.	2014	PLoS One	The use of different expression systems to produce the same recombinant human protein can result in expression-dependent chemical modifications (CMs) leading to variability of structure, stability and immunogenicity. Of particular interest are recombinant human proteins expressed in plant-based systems, which have shown particularly high CM variability. In studies presented here, recombinant human serum albumins (rHSA) produced in Oryza sativa (Asian rice) (OsrHSA) from a number of suppliers have been extensively characterized and compared to plasma-derived HSA (pHSA) and rHSA expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The heterogeneity of each sample was evaluated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Modifications of the samples were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The secondary and tertiary structure of the albumin samples were assessed with far U/V circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (far U/V CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. Far U/V CD and fluorescence analyses were also used to assess thermal stability and drug binding. High molecular weight aggregates in OsrHSA samples were detected with SEC and supplier-to-supplier variability and, more critically, lot-to-lot variability in one manufactures supplied products were identified. LC-MS analysis identified a greater number of hexose-glycated arginine and lysine residues on OsrHSA compared to pHSA or rHSA expressed in yeast. This analysis also showed supplier-to-supplier and lot-to-lot variability in the degree of glycation at specific lysine and arginine residues for OsrHSA. Both the number of glycated residues and the degree of glycation correlated positively with the quantity of non-monomeric species and the chromatographic profiles of the samples. Tertiary structural changes were observed for most OsrHSA samples which correlated well with the degree of arginine/lysine glycation. The extensive glycation of OsrHSA from multiple suppliers may have further implications for the use of OsrHSA as a therapeutic product.
25315105	OsCYCP1;1, a PHO80 homologous protein, negatively regulates phosphate starvation signaling in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Phosphorus is one of the most essential and limiting nutrients in all living organisms, thus the organisms have evolved complicated and precise regulatory mechanisms for phosphorus acquisition, storage and homeostasis. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the modification of PHO4 by the PHO80 and PHO85 complex is a core regulation system. However, the existence and possible functions in phosphate signaling of the homologs of the PHO80 and PHO85 components in plants has yet to be determined. Here we describe the identification of a family of seven PHO80 homologous genes in rice named OsCYCPs. Among these, the OsCYCP1;1 gene was able to partially rescue the pho80 mutant strain of yeast. The OsCYCP1;1 protein was predominantly localized in the nucleus, and was ubiquitously expressed throughout the whole plant and during the entire growth period of rice. Consistent with the negative role of PHO80 in phosphate signaling in yeast, OsCYCP1;1 expression was reduced by phosphate starvation in the roots. This reduction was dependent on PHR2, the central regulator of phosphate signaling in rice. Overexpression and suppression of the expression of OsCYCP1;1 influenced the phosphate starvation signaling response. The inducible expression of phosphate starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes was suppressed in the OsCYCP1;1 overexpression lines and was relatively enhanced in the OsCYCP1;1 RNAi plants by phosphate starvation. Together, these results demonstrate the role of PHO80 homologs in the phosphate starvation signaling pathway in rice.
25372696	Structure of the OsSERK2 leucine-rich repeat extracellular domain.	2014	Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr	Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing integral membrane receptors that are involved in the regulation of development and immune responses in plants. It has recently been shown that rice SERK2 (OsSERK2) is essential for XA21-mediated resistance to the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. OsSERK2 is also required for the BRI1-mediated, FLS2-mediated and EFR-mediated responses to brassinosteroids, flagellin and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), respectively. Here, crystal structures of the LRR domains of OsSERK2 and a D128N OsSERK2 mutant, expressed as hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) fusions, are reported. These structures suggest that the aspartate mutation does not generate any significant conformational change in the protein, but instead leads to an altered interaction with partner receptors.
25336568	Genome-wide Identification and Functional Analysis of Genes Expressed Ubiquitously in Rice.	2014	Mol Plant	Genes that are expressed ubiquitously throughout all developmental stages are thought to be necessary for basic biological or cellular functions. Therefore, determining their biological roles is a great challenge. We identified 4,034 of these genes in rice after studying the results of Agilent 44K and Affymetrix meta-anatomical expression profiles. Among the 105 that were characterized by loss-of-function analysis, 79 were classified as members of gene families, with the majority of them being predominantly expressed. Using T-DNA insertional mutants, we examined 43 genes and found that loss-of-expression in six caused developing seed- or seedling-defective phenotypes. Of them, three are singletons without same family members and easily expect the defective phenotypes by the mutations. Phylogenomic analyses integrating genome-wide transcriptome data revealed the functional dominance of three ubiquitously expressed family genes. From them, we investigated the role of Os03g19890, which is involved in ATP generation within the mitochondria during endosperm development. We also created and evaluated functional networks associated with that gene to understand the molecular mechanism. Our study will provide useful strategy for pheonome analysis of ubiquitously expressed genes.
25311683	Rice SUV3 is a bidirectional helicase that binds both DNA and RNA.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Helicases play crucial role in almost all the nucleic acid metabolism including replication, repair, recombination, transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis and splicing and these processes regulate plant growth and development. It is suggested that helicases play essential roles in stabilizing growth in plants under stress because their presence in the stress-induced ORFs has been identified. Moreover in a recent study we have reported that SUV3 helicase from Oryza sativa (OsSUV3) functions in salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice by improving the antioxidant machinery. SUV3 helicase has been identified and characterized from yeast and human systems but the properties and functions of plant SUV3 are poorly understood.

RESULTS: In this study, the purification and extensive characterization of recombinant OsSUV3 protein (67 kDa) is presented. OsSUV3 binds to DNA and RNA and exhibits DNA as well as RNA-dependent ATPase activities. It also contains the characteristic DNA and RNA helicase activity. OsSUV3 can use mainly ATP or dATP as energy source for the unwinding activity and it cannot unwind the blunt-end duplex DNA substrate. It is interesting to note that OsSUV3 unwinds DNA in both the 5'-3' and 3'-5 directions and thus its activity is bipolar in vitro. The Km values of OsSUV3 are 0.51 nM and 0.95 nM for DNA helicase and RNA helicase, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first direct evidence to show the bipolar DNA helicase activity of OsSUV3 protein. The unique properties of OsSUV3 including its dual helicase activity imply that it could be a multifunctional protein involved in biologically significant process of DNA and RNA metabolisms. These results should make significant contribution towards better understanding of SUV3 protein in plants.
25336684	Transcripts of two ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles.	2015	J Exp Bot	Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoid phytohormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth. Tetracyclic hydrocarbon ent-kaurene is a biosynthetic intermediate of GAs, and is converted from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a common precursor of diterpenoids, via ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) through successive cyclization reactions catalysed by two distinct diterpene synthases, ent-CDP synthase and ent-kaurene synthase. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two ent-CDP synthase genes, OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. It has been thought that OsCPS1 participates in GA biosynthesis, while OsCPS2 participates in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, phytocassanes A-E, and oryzalexins A-F. It has been shown previously that loss-of-function OsCPS1 mutants display a severe dwarf phenotype caused by GA deficiency despite possessing another ent-CDP synthase gene, OsCPS2. Here, experiments were performed to account for the non-redundant biological function of OsCPS1 and OsCPS2. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that OsCPS2 transcript levels were drastically lower than those of OsCPS1 in the basal parts, including the meristem of the second-leaf sheaths of rice seedlings. qRT-PCR results using tissue samples prepared by laser microdissection suggested that OsCPS1 transcripts mainly localized in vascular bundle tissues, similar to Arabidopsis CPS, which is responsible for GA biosynthesis, whereas OsCPS2 transcripts mainly localized in epidermal cells that address environmental stressors such as pathogen attack. Furthermore, the OsCPS2 transgene under regulation of the OsCPS1 promoter complemented the dwarf phenotype of an OsCPS1 mutant, oscps1-1. The results indicate that transcripts of the two ent-CDP synthase genes differentially localize in rice plants according to their distinct biological roles, OsCPS1 for growth and OsCPS2 for defence.
25335639	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity.	2014	Plant J	Microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity plays critical roles in the basal resistance defense response in plants. Chitin and peptidoglycan (PGN) are major molecular patterns for fungi and bacteria, respectively. Two rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, function as receptors that sense bacterial PGN and fungal chitin. These membrane receptors, which lack intracellular kinase domains, likely contain another component for transmembrane immune signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that the rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1, a key component of the chitin elicitor signaling pathway, also plays an important role in PGN-triggered immunity in rice. Silencing of OsCERK1 suppressed PGN-induced (and chitin-induced) immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene expression, and callose deposition, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for both PGN and chitin signaling initiated by OsLYP4 and OsLYP6. OsLYP4 associated with OsLYP6 and the rice chitin receptor chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP) in the absence of PGN or chitin, and treatment with PGN or chitin led to their disassociation in vivo. OsCERK1 associated with OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when induced by PGN but it associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6, or CEBiP under chitin treatment, suggesting the presence of different patterns of ligand-induced heterooligomeric receptor complexes. Furthermore, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176 functions downstream of OsCERK1 in the PGN and chitin signaling pathways, suggesting that these MAMPs share overlapping intracellular signaling components. Therefore, OsCERK1 plays dual roles in PGN and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity and as an adaptor involved in signal transduction at the plasma membrane in conjunction with OsLYP4 and OsLYP6.
25324400	Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	The indeterminate gametophyte1 (ig1) mutation was first characterized to modulate female gametophyte development in maize (Zea mays). However, the function of its rice orthologue, OsIG1, remains unknown. For this, we first analysed OsIG1 localization from differential tissues in rice. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and histochemical staining results demonstrated that the expression signal of OsIG1 was strongly detected in young inflorescence, moderately in mature flower and weakly in leaf. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization analyses exhibited that OsIG1 was strongly expressed in inflorescence meristems, floral meristems, empty-glume- and floret- primordia, especially in the primordia of stamens and immature ovules, and the micropylar side of the mature ovary. In OsIG1-RNAi lines, wrinkled blade formation was accompanied by increased leaf inclination angle. Cross-section further showed that the number of bulliform cells located between the vasculatures was significantly increased, indicating that OsIG1 is involved in division and differentiation of bulliform cell and lateral growth during leaf development. OsIG1-RNAi suppression lines showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including degenerated palea, glume-like features and open hull. In addition, a single OsIG1-RNAi floret is characterized by frequently developing double ovules with abnormal embryo sac development. Additionally, down-regulation of OsIG1 differentially affected the expression of genes associated with the floral organ development including EG1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsIG1 plays an essential role in the regulation of empty-glume identity, floral organ number control and female gametophyte development in rice.
25280591	Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel gene family in rice, identification, characterization and experimental analysis of expression response to plant hormones, biotic and abiotic stresses.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are Ca2+-permeable cation transport channels, which are present in both animal and plant systems. They have been implicated in the uptake of both essential and toxic cations, Ca2+ signaling, pathogen defense, and thermotolerance in plants. To date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the CNGC gene family in any economically important crop, including rice (Oryza sativa L.). There is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis and experimental verification of this gene family in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, a total of 16 full length rice CNGC genes distributed on chromosomes 1-6, 9 and 12, were identified by employing comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. Based on phylogeny, the family of OsCNGCs was classified into four major groups (I-IV) and two sub-groups (IV-A and IV- B). Likewise, the CNGCs from all plant lineages clustered into four groups (I-IV), where group II was conserved in all land plants. Gene duplication analysis revealed that both chromosomal segmentation (OsCNGC1 and 2, 10 and 11, 15 and 16) and tandem duplications (OsCNGC1 and 2) significantly contributed to the expansion of this gene family. Motif composition and protein sequence analysis revealed that the CNGC specific domain "cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD)" comprises a "phosphate binding cassette" (PBC) and a "hinge" region that is highly conserved among the OsCNGCs. In addition, OsCNGC proteins also contain various other functional motifs and post-translational modification sites. We successively built a stringent motif: (LI-X(2)-[GS]-X-[FV]-X-G-[1]-ELL-X-W-X(12,22)-SA-X(2)-T-X(7)-[EQ]-AF-X-L) that recognizes the rice CNGCs specifically. Prediction of cis-acting regulatory elements in 5' upstream sequences and expression analyses through quantitative qPCR demonstrated that OsCNGC genes were highly responsive to multiple stimuli including hormonal (abscisic acid, indoleacetic acid, kinetin and ethylene), biotic (Pseudomonas fuscovaginae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) and abiotic (cold) stress.

CONCLUSIONS: There are 16 CNGC genes in rice, which were probably expanded through chromosomal segmentation and tandem duplications and comprise a PBC and a "hinge" region in the CNBD domain, featured by a stringent motif. The various cis-acting regulatory elements in the upstream sequences may be responsible for responding to multiple stimuli, including hormonal, biotic and abiotic stresses.
25283804	Overexpression of a NF-YC transcription factor from bermudagrass confers tolerance to drought and salinity in transgenic rice.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a ubiquitous transcription factor formed by three distinct subunits, namely NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. A stress-responsive cDNA of NF-YC (Cdt-NF-YC1) was isolated from triploid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × Cynodon transvaalensis), and its role in abiotic stress tolerance was investigated in this study. Cdt-NF-YC1 transcript was detected in all vegetative tissues with higher levels being observed in roots. Transcription of Cdt-NF-YC1 in leaves was induced by dehydration, salinity, and treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) or nitric oxide (NO), but not altered by cold. The dehydration- or salt-induced transcription of Cdt-NF-YC1 was blocked by inhibitor of ABA synthesis and scavenger of H2 O2 or NO, indicating that ABA, H2 O2 and NO were involved in the dehydration- and salt-induced transcription of Cdt-NF-YC1. Overexpression of Cdt-NF-YC1 resulted in elevated tolerance to drought and salt stress and increased sensitivity to ABA in transgenic rice. Transcript levels of stress/ABA responsive genes (OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, OsLIP9 and OsP5CS1), ABA synthesis and signalling genes (OsNCED3 and OsABI2), and ABA-independent genes (OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B and OsDREB2A) were substantially higher in transgenic rice than in wild-type plants. The results suggested that that Cdt-NF-YC1 is a good candidate gene to increase drought and salinity tolerance in transgenic rice through modulating gene regulation in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.
25311360	OsAUX1 controls lateral root initiation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Polar auxin transport, mediated by influx and efflux transporters, controls many aspects of plant growth and development. The auxin influx carriers in Arabidopsis have been shown to control lateral root development and gravitropism, but little is known about these proteins in rice. This paper reports on the functional characterization of OsAUX1. Three OsAUX1 T-DNA insertion mutants and RNAi knockdown transgenic plants reduced lateral root initiation compared with wild-type (WT) plants. OsAUX1 overexpression plants exhibited increased lateral root initiation and OsAUX1 was highly expressed in lateral roots and lateral root primordia. Similarly, the auxin reporter, DR5-GUS, was expressed at lower levels in osaux1 than in the WT plants, which indicated that the auxin levels in the mutant roots had decreased. Exogenous 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA) treatment rescued the defective phenotype in osaux1-1 plants, whereas indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 2,4-D could not, which suggested that OsAUX1 was a putative auxin influx carrier. The transcript levels of several auxin signalling genes and cell cycle genes significantly declined in osaux1, hinting that the regulatory role of OsAUX1 may be mediated by auxin signalling and cell cycle genes. Overall, our results indicated that OsAUX1 was involved in polar auxin transport and functioned to control auxin-mediated lateral root initiation in rice.
25270993	A proteomic analysis of rice seed germination as affected by high temperature and ABA treatment.	2015	Physiol Plant	Seed germination is a critical phase in the plant life cycle, but the specific events associated with seed germination are still not fully understood. In this study, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry to investigate the changes in the proteome during imbibition of Oryza sativa seeds at optimal temperature with or without abscisic acid (ABA) and high temperature (germination thermoinhibition) to further identify and quantify key proteins required for seed germination. A total of 121 protein spots showed a significant change in abundance (1.5-fold increase/decrease) during germination under all conditions. Among these proteins, we found seven proteins specifically associated with seed germination including glycosyl hydrolases family 38 protein, granule-bound starch synthase 1, Os03g0842900 (putative steroleosin-B), N-carbamoylputrescine amidase, spermidine synthase 1, tubulin α-1 chain and glutelin type-A; and a total of 20 imbibition response proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell growth, cell defense and storage proteins. High temperature inhibited seed germination by decreasing the abundance of proteins involved in methionine metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, reserve degradation, protein folding and stress responses. ABA treatment inhibited germination and decreased the abundance of proteins associated with methionine metabolism, energy production and cell division. Our results show that changes in many biological processes including energy metabolism, protein synthesis and cell defense and rescue occurred as a result of all treatments, while enzymes involved in methionine metabolism and weakening of cell wall specifically accumulated when the seeds germinated at the optimal temperature.
25287121	Diversification of the C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) gene family in angiosperms, and evolution of plant-family specific CEP genes.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Small, secreted signaling peptides work in parallel with phytohormones to control important aspects of plant growth and development. Genes from the C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) family produce such peptides which negatively regulate plant growth, especially under stress, and affect other important developmental processes. To illuminate how the CEP gene family has evolved within the plant kingdom, including its emergence, diversification and variation between lineages, a comprehensive survey was undertaken to identify and characterize CEP genes in 106 plant genomes.

RESULTS: Using a motif-based system developed for this study to identify canonical CEP peptide domains, a total of 916 CEP genes and 1,223 CEP domains were found in angiosperms and for the first time in gymnosperms. This defines a narrow band for the emergence of CEP genes in plants, from the divergence of lycophytes to the angiosperm/gymnosperm split. Both CEP genes and domains were found to have diversified in angiosperms, particularly in the Poaceae and Solanaceae plant families. Multispecies orthologous relationships were determined for 22% of identified CEP genes, and further analysis of those groups found selective constraints upon residues within the CEP peptide and within the previously little-characterized variable region. An examination of public Oryza sativa RNA-Seq datasets revealed an expression pattern that links OsCEP5 and OsCEP6 to panicle development and flowering, and CEP gene trees reveal these emerged from a duplication event associated with the Poaceae plant family.

CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the plant-family specific CEP genes OsCEP5 and OsCEP6, the association of CEP genes with angiosperm-specific development processes like panicle development, and the diversification of CEP genes in angiosperms provides further support for the hypothesis that CEP genes have been integral to the evolution of novel traits within the angiosperm lineage. Beyond these findings, the comprehensive set of CEP genes and their properties reported here will be a resource for future research on CEP genes and peptides.
25318938	A STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC1-regulated protein phosphatase gene rice protein phosphatase18 modulates drought and oxidative stress tolerance through abscisic acid-independent reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Plants respond to abiotic stresses through a complexity of signaling pathways, and the dephosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatase (PP) is an important event in this process. We identified a rice (Oryza sativa) PP2C gene, OsPP18, as a STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC1 (SNAC1)-regulated downstream gene. The ospp18 mutant was more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages. Rice plants with OsPP18 suppressed through artificial microRNA were also hypersensitive to drought stress. Microarray analysis of the mutant revealed that genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes were down-regulated in the ospp18 mutant, and the mutant exhibited reduced activities of ROS scavenging enzymes and increased sensitivity to oxidative stresses. Overexpression of OsPP18 in rice led to enhanced osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance. The expression of OsPP18 was induced by drought stress but not induced by abscisic acid (ABA). Although OsPP18 is a typical PP2C with enzymatic activity, it did not interact with SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE2 protein kinases, which function in ABA signaling. Meanwhile, the expression of ABA-responsive genes was not affected in the ospp18 mutant, and the ABA sensitivities of the ospp18 mutant and OsPP18-overexpressing plants were also not altered. Together, these findings suggest that OsPP18 is a unique PP2C gene that is regulated by SNAC1 and confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating ROS homeostasis through ABA-independent pathways.
25353370	OsLOL1, a C2C2-type zinc finger protein, interacts with OsbZIP58 to promote seed germination through the modulation of gibberellin biosynthesis in Oryza sativa.	2014	Plant J	Seed germination is a key developmental process in the plant life cycle that is influenced by various environmental cues and phytohormones through gene expression and a series of metabolism pathways. In the present study, we investigated a C2C2-type finger protein, OsLOL1, which promotes gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and affects seed germination in Oryza sativa (rice). We used OsLOL1 antisense and sense transgenic lines to explore OsLOL1 functions. Seed germination timing in antisense plants was restored to wild type when exogenous GA3 was applied. The reduced expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsKO2 and the accumulation of ent-kaurene were observed during germination in antisense plants. Based on yeast two-hybrid and firefly luciferase complementation analyses, OsLOL1 interacted with the basic leucine zipper protein OsbZIP58. The results from electrophoretic mobility shift and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that OsbZIP58 binds the G-box cis-element of the OsKO2 promoter and activates LUC reporter gene expression, and that interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 activates OsKO2 gene expression. In addition, OsLOL1 decreased SOD1 gene expression and accelerated programmed cell death (PCD) in the aleurone layer of rice grains. These findings demonstrate that the interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 influences GA biosynthesis through the activation of OsKO2 via OsbZIP58, thereby stimulating aleurone PCD and seed germination.
25014590	OsNAC111, a blast disease-responsive transcription factor in rice, positively regulates the expression of defense-related genes.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plants respond to pathogen attack by transcriptionally regulating defense-related genes via various types of transcription factors. We identified a transcription factor in rice, OsNAC111, belonging to the TERN subgroup of the NAC family that was transcriptionally upregulated after rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) inoculation. OsNAC111 was localized in the nucleus of rice cells and had transcriptional activation activity in yeast and rice cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC111 showed increased resistance to the rice blast fungus. In OsNAC111-overexpressing plants, the expression of several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, was constitutively high compared with the control. These genes all showed blast disease-responsive expression in leaves. Among them, two chitinase genes and one β-1,3-glucanase gene showed reduced expression in transgenic rice plants in which OsNAC111 function was suppressed by a chimeric repressor (OsNAC111-SRDX). OsNAC111 activated transcription from the promoters of the chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase genes in rice cells. In addition, brown pigmentation at the infection sites, a defense response of rice cells to the blast fungus, was lowered in OsNAC111-SRDX plants at the early infection stage. These results indicate that OsNAC111 positively regulates the expression of a specific set of PR genes in the disease response and contributes to disease resistance.
25371504	SASP, a Senescence-Associated Subtilisin Protease, is involved in reproductive development and determination of silique number in Arabidopsis.	2015	J Exp Bot	Senescence involves increased expression of proteases, which may participate in nitrogen recycling or cellular signalling. 2D zymograms detected two protein species with increased proteolytic activity in senescing leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. A proteomic analysis revealed that both protein species correspond to a subtilisin protease encoded by At3g14067, termed Senescence-Associated Subtilisin Protease (SASP). SASP mRNA levels and enzyme activity increase during leaf senescence in leaves senescing during both the vegetative or the reproductive phase of the plant life cycle, but this increase is more pronounced in reproductive plants. SASP is expressed in all above-ground organs, but not in roots. Putative AtSASP orthologues were identified in dicot and monocot crop species. A phylogenetic analysis shows AtSASP and its putative orthologues clustering in one discrete group of subtilisin proteases in which no other Arabidospsis subtilisin protease is present. Phenotypic analysis of two knockout lines for SASP showed that mutant plants develop more inflorescence branches during reproductive development. Both AtSASP and its putative rice orthologue (OsSASP) were constitutively expressed in sasp-1 to complement the mutant phenotype. At maturity, sasp-1 plants produced 25% more inflorescence branches and siliques than either the wild-type or the rescued lines. These differences were mostly due to an increased number of second and third order branches. The increased number of siliques was compensated for by a small decrease (5.0%) in seed size. SASP downregulates branching and silique production during monocarpic senescence, and its function is at least partially conserved between Arabidopsis and rice.
25374002	Cholesterol-lowering effect of rice bran protein containing bile acid-binding proteins.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Dietary plant protein is well known to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Rice bran is a by-product of rice milling and is a good source of protein. The present study examined whether feeding rats a high-cholesterol diet containing 10% rice bran protein (RBP) for 10 d affected cholesterol metabolism. Rats fed dietary RBP had lower serum total cholesterol levels and increased excretion of fecal steroids, such as cholesterol and bile acids, than those fed dietary casein. In vitro assays showed that RBP strongly bound to taurocholate, and inhibited the micellar solubility of cholesterol, compared with casein. Moreover, the bile acid-binding proteins of the RBP were eluted by a chromatographic column conjugated with cholic acid, and one of them was identified as hypothetical protein OsJ_13801 (NCBI accession No. EAZ29742) using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. These results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic action of the RBP may be caused by the bile acid-binding proteins.
25367381	Fine mapping of the qLOP2 and qPSR2-1 loci associated with chilling stress tolerance of wild rice seedlings.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Using leaf osmotic potential and plant survival rate as chilling-tolerant trait indices, we identified two major quantitative trait loci qLOP2 and qPSR2 - 1 (39.3-kb region) and Os02g0677300 as the cold-inducible gene for these loci. Chilling stress tolerance (CST) at the seedling stage is an important trait affecting rice production in temperate climate and high-altitude areas. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with CST, a mapping population consisting of 151 BC(2)F(1) plants was constructed by using chilling-tolerant Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) as a donor parent and chilling-sensitive indica as a recurrent parent. With leaf osmotic potential (LOP) and plant survival rate (PSR) as chilling-tolerant trait indexes, two major QTLs, qLOP2 (LOD = 3.8) and qPSR2-1 (LOD = 3.3), were detected on the long arm of chromosome 2 by composite interval mapping method in QTL Cartographer software, which explained 10.1 and 12.3% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. In R/QTL analyzed result, their major effects were also confirmed. Using molecular marker RM318 and RM106, qLOP2 and qPSR2-1 have been introgressed into chilling-sensitive varieties (93-11 and Yuefeng) by marker-assisted selection procedure (MAS), which resulted in 16 BC(5)F(3) BILs that chilling tolerance have significantly enhanced compare with wild-type parents (P < 0.01). Therefore, two large segregating populations of 11,326 BC(4)F(2) and 8,642 BC(4)F(3) were developed to fine mapping of qLOP2 and qPSR2-1. Lastly, they were dissected to a 39.3-kb candidate region between marker RM221 and RS8. Expression and sequence analysis results indicated that Os02g0677300 was a cold-inducible gene for these loci. Our study provides novel alleles for improving rice CST by MAS and contributes to the understanding of its molecular mechanisms.
25398395	The B″ regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A mediates the dephosphorylation of rice retinoblastoma-related protein-1.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	The phosphorylation of plant retinoblastoma-related (RBR) proteins by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is well documented, but the counteracting phosphatases have not been identified yet. We report here that rice retinoblastoma-related protein-1 (OsRBR1) interacted with the B″ subunit of rice protein phosphatase 2A (OsPP2A B″) and underwent reversible phosphorylation during the cell division cycle. The OsRBR1-OsPP2A B" association required B domain in OsRBR1 and the C-terminal region of OsPP2A B″. We found by immunoprecipitation that OsPP2A B″, OsPP2A catalytic subunit subtype II, PSTAIRE-type CDK and OsRBR1 were in the same protein complex, indicating a physical association between the phosphatase, the kinase and their common substrate. OsPP2A B″ contains three predicted CDK phosphorylation sites: Ser95, Ser102 and Ser119. The in vitro phosphorylation of Ser95 and Ser119 with PSTAIRE-kinases was verified by mass spectrometry. We generated a series of phosphorylation site mutants to mimic the dephosphorylated or phosphorylated states of OsPP2A B″, and confirmed that all of the three predicted sites can be phosphorylated. Yeast two-hybrid experiments suggested that the phosphorylation of OsPP2A B″ promoted the formation of the OsPP2A holoenzyme. A triple phosphorylation mimicking OsPP2A B″ mutant containing holoenzyme showed higher activity in phosphatase assays. Our data collectively show that the phosphatase activity of OsPP2A against OsRBR1 is regulated by the phosphorylation of its B″ regulatory subunit. However, the analysis of the effect of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, in rice cell suspension cultures revealed that the dephosphorylation of OsRBR1 was completely inhibited only by high dose (300 nM) of the okadaic acid during the cell cycle progression. Therefore the role of the protein phosphatase 1 should be considered as an additional post translational regulatory component of RBR protein function in higher plants.
25385766	Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Drought is a recurring climatic hazard that reduces the crop yields. To avoid the negative effects of drought on crop production, extensive efforts have been devoted to investigating the complex mechanisms of gene expression and signal transduction during drought stress. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in perceiving extracellular stimuli and activating downstream signalling responses. The rice genome contains >1100 RLK genes, of which only two are reported to function in drought stress. A leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RLK gene named Leaf Panicle 2 (LP2) was previously found to be strongly expressed in leaves and other photosynthetic tissues, but its function remains unclear. In the present study, it was shown that the expression of LP2 was down-regulated by drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic plants overexpressing LP2 accumulated less H₂O₂, had more open stomata in leaves, and showed hypersensitivity to drought stress. Further investigation revealed that transcription of LP2 was directly regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST). In addition, LP2 was identified as a functional kinase localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with the drought-responsive aquaporin proteins OsPIP1; 1, OsPIP1; 3, and OsPIP2; 3. Thus, the findings provided evidence that the LRR-RLK LP2, transcriptionally regulated by the drought-related transcription factor DST, served as a negative regulator in drought response.
25388636	Bacterial effector modulation of host E3 ligase activity suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	Pathogen effector proteins are delivered to host cells to suppress plant immunity. However, the mechanisms by which effector proteins function are largely unknown. Here we show that expression of XopP(Xoo), an effector of rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, in rice strongly suppresses peptidoglycan (PGN)- and chitin-triggered immunity and resistance to X. oryzae. XopP(Xoo) targets OsPUB44, a rice ubiquitin E3 ligase with a unique U-box domain. We find that XopP(Xoo) directly interacts with the OsPUB44 U-box domain and inhibits ligase activity. Two amino-acid residues specific for the OsPUB44 U-box domain are identified, which are responsible for the interaction with XopP(Xoo). Silencing of OsPUB44 suppresses PGN- and chitin-triggered immunity and X. oryzae resistance, indicating that OsPUB44 positively regulates immune responses. Thus, it is likely that XopP(Xoo) suppresses immune responses by directly interacting with and inhibiting a positive regulator of plant immunity.
25399351	Genome-wide identification and analysis of Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like kinases in rice.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: A genome-wide survey of Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase1-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls) in rice revealed that the pattern of expression by some CrRLK1Ls is controlled by drought or circadian rhythms. This is probably accomplished through the functioning of Gigantea ( OsGI ). Such findings provide a novel angle for using CrRLK1Ls to study the drought-stress response and circadian regulation. The 17 CrRLK1L members of a novel RLK family have been identified in Arabidopsis. Each carries a putative extracellular carbohydrate-binding malectin-like domain. However, their roles in rice, a widely consumed staple food, are not well understood. To investigate the functions of CrRLK1Ls in rice, we utilized phylogenomics data obtained through anatomical and diurnal meta-expression analyses. This information was integrated with a large set of public microarray data within the context of the rice CrRLK1L family phylogenic tree. Chromosomal locations indicated that 3 of 16 genes were tandem-duplicated, suggesting possible functional redundancy within this family. However, integrated diurnal expression showed functional divergence between two of three genes, i.e., peak expression was detected during the day for OsCrRLK1L2, but during the night for OsCrRLK1L3. We found it interesting that OsCrRLK1L2 expression was repressed in osgigantea (osgi) mutants, which suggests that it could function downstream of OsGI. Network analysis associated with OsCrRLK1L2 and OsGI suggested a novel circadian regulation mechanism mediated by OsGI. In addition, two of five OsCrRLK1Ls preferentially expressed in the roots were stimulated by drought, suggesting a potential role for this family in water-use efficiency. This preliminary identification of CrRLK1Ls and study of their expression in rice will facilitate further functional classifications and applications in plant production.
25402448	Characterization and expression analyses of two plastidic enolase genes in rice.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	To verify the presence of enolase related to the chloroplastic glycolysis in rice, database search was carried out and identified seven putative enolase genes in the rice genome. Among them, OsEno1 and OsEno3 encode long proteins with N-terminal extensions. GFP protein fusions of these N-terminal extensions were both targeted to plastids of onion epidermal cell. Promoter::GUS analysis showed that OsEno3 was highly expressed in young developing leaves, but its expression was drastically decreased during leaf development and greening. On the other hand, the expression of OsEno1 was low and detected in limited portions such as leaf sheath at the tiller base. Recombinant OsEno1 protein showed enolase activity with a pH optimum at pH 8.0, whereas OsEno3 did not exhibit detectable activity. Although it remains obscure if OsEno3 encodes a functional enolase in vivo, our results demonstrate that the entire glycolytic pathway does not operate in rice chloroplasts.
25433856	The rice OsAMT1;1 is a proton-independent feedback regulated ammonium transporter.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Functional identification of a relatively lower affinity ammonium transporter, OsAMT1;1, which is a proton-independent feedback regulated ammonium transporter in rice. Rice genome contains at least 12 ammonium transporters, though their functionality has not been clearly resolved. Here, we demonstrate the functional properties of OsAMT1;1 applying functional complementation and (15)NH4 (+) uptake determination in yeast cells in combination with electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes. Our results show that OsAMT1;1 is a NH4 (+) transporter with relatively lower affinity to NH4 (+) (110-129 μM in oocytes and yeast cells, respectively). Under our experimental conditions, OsAMT1;1-mediated NH4 (+) uptake or current is not significantly modulated by extra- or intracellular pH gradient, suggesting that this transporter probably functions as a NH4 (+) uniporter. Inhibition of yeast growth or currents elicited from oocytes by ammonium assimilation inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine indicates that NH4 (+) transport by OsAMT1;1 is likely feedback regulated by accumulation of the substrate. In addition, effects of phosphorylation inhibitors imply that NH4 (+) uptake by OsAMT1;1 is also modulated by tyrosine-specific protein kinase or calcium-regulated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase involved phosphorylation processes.
25430981	Rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20) plays an important role in producing terpene volatiles in response to abiotic stresses.	2015	Protoplasma	This study examined the volatile terpenes produced by rice seedlings in response to oxidative stress induced by various abiotic factors. Solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analyses revealed that when exposed to UV-B radiation, rice seedlings emitted a bouquet of monoterpene mixtures in a time-dependent manner. The mixtures comprised limonene, sabinene, myrcene, α-terpinene, β-ocimene, γ-terpinene, and α-terpinolene. Among them, (S)-limonene was the most abundant volatile, discriminated by chiral SPME-GC-MS. The volatile profiles collected from rice plants treated with both γ-irradiation and H2O2 were identical to those observed in the UV-B irradiated plants, thus indicating that the volatile mixtures were specifically produced in response to oxidative stress, particularly in the presence of H2O2. Using a reverse genetics approach, we isolated full-length rice terpene synthase 20 (OsTPS20, 599 amino acids, 69.39 kDa), which was further characterized as an (S)-limonene synthase by removing the N-terminal signal peptide (63 amino acids) of the protein. The recombinant OsTPS20 protein catalyzed the conversion of geranyl diphosphate to (S)-limonene and other minor monoterpenes, essentially covering all of the volatile compounds detected from the plant. Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that the transcript levels of OsTPS20 were significantly induced in response to oxidative stress, thereby suggesting that OsTPS20 plays a major role in producing terpene volatiles during abiotic stress. Detailed biochemical analyses and the unusual domain characteristics of OsTPS20 are also discussed in this report.
25426937	The effect of Silicon on photosynthesis and expression of its relevant genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under high-zinc stress.	2014	PLoS One	The main objectives of this study were to elucidate the roles of silicon (Si) in alleviating the effects of 2 mM zinc (high Zn) stress on photosynthesis and its related gene expression levels in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown hydroponically with high-Zn stress. The results showed that photosynthetic parameters, including net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, chlorophyll concentration and the chlorophyll fluorescence, were decreased in rice exposed to high-Zn treatment. The leaf chloroplast structure was disordered under high-Zn stress, including uneven swelling, disintegrated and missing thylakoid membranes, and decreased starch granule size and number, which, however, were all counteracted by the addition of 1.5 mM Si. Furthermore, the expression levels of Os08g02630 (PsbY), Os05g48630 (PsaH), Os07g37030 (PetC), Os03g57120 (PetH), Os09g26810 and Os04g38410 decreased in Si-deprived plants under high-Zn stress. Nevertheless, the addition of 1.5 mM Si increased the expression levels of these genes in plants under high-Zn stress at 72 h, and the expression levels were higher in Si-treated plants than in Si-deprived plants. Therefore, we conclude that Si alleviates the Zn-induced damage to photosynthesis in rice. The decline of photosynthesis in Zn-stressed rice was attributed to stomatal limitation, and Si activated and regulated some photosynthesis-related genes in response to high-Zn stress, consequently increasing photosynthesis.
25418842	High-level hemicellulosic arabinose predominately affects lignocellulose crystallinity for genetically enhancing both plant lodging resistance and biomass enzymatic digestibility in rice mutants.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice is a major food crop with enormous biomass residue for biofuels. As plant cell wall recalcitrance basically decides a costly biomass process, genetic modification of plant cell walls has been regarded as a promising solution. However, due to structural complexity and functional diversity of plant cell walls, it becomes essential to identify the key factors of cell wall modifications that could not much alter plant growth, but cause an enhancement in biomass enzymatic digestibility. To address this issue, we performed systems biology analyses of a total of 36 distinct cell wall mutants of rice. As a result, cellulose crystallinity (CrI) was examined to be the key factor that negatively determines either the biomass enzymatic saccharification upon various chemical pretreatments or the plant lodging resistance, an integrated agronomic trait in plant growth and grain production. Notably, hemicellulosic arabinose (Ara) was detected to be the major factor that negatively affects cellulose CrI probably through its interlinking with β-1,4-glucans. In addition, lignin and G monomer also exhibited the positive impact on biomass digestion and lodging resistance. Further characterization of two elite mutants, Osfc17 and Osfc30, showing normal plant growth and high biomass enzymatic digestion in situ and in vitro, revealed the multiple GH9B candidate genes for reducing cellulose CrI and XAT genes for increasing hemicellulosic Ara level. Hence, the results have suggested the potential cell wall modifications for enhancing both biomass enzymatic digestibility and plant lodging resistance by synchronically overexpressing GH9B and XAT genes in rice.
25546583	Transcriptional profile of genes involved in ascorbate glutathione cycle in senescing leaves for an early senescence leaf (esl) rice mutant.	2015	J Plant Physiol	To clarify the complex relationship between ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and H2O2-induced leaf senescence, the genotype-dependent difference in some senescence-related physiological parameters and the transcript levels and the temporal patterns of genes involved in the AsA-GSH cycle during leaf senescence were investigated using two rice genotypes, namely, the early senescence leaf (esl) mutant and its wild type. Meanwhile, the triggering effect of exogenous H2O2 on the expression of OsAPX genes was examined using detached leaves. The results showed that the esl mutant had higher H2O2 level than its wild type at the initial stage of leaf senescence. At transcriptional level, the association of expression of various genes involved in the AsA-GSH cycle with leaf senescence was isoform dependent. For OsAPXs, the transcripts of two cytosolic OsAPX genes (OsAPX1 and OsAPX2), thylakoid-bound OsAPX8, chloroplastic OsAPX7 and peroxisomal OsAPX4 exhibited remarkable genotype-dependent variation in their expression levels and temporal patterns during leaf senescence, there were significantly increasing transcripts of OsAXP1 and OsAPX7, severely repressed transcripts of OsAPX4 and OsAPX8 for the esl rice at the initial leaf senescence. In contrast, the repressing transcript of OsAPX8 was highly sensitive to the increasing H2O2 level in the senescing rice leaves, while higher H2O2 concentration resulted in the enhancing transcripts of two cytosolic OsAPX genes, OsAPX7 transcript was greatly variable with different H2O2 concentrations and incubating duration, suggesting that the different OsAPXs isoforms played a complementary role in perceiving and scavenging H2O2 accumulation at various H2O2 concentrations during leaf senescence. Higher H2O2 level, increased AsA level, higher activities of APX and glutathione reductase (GR), and relatively stable GSH content during the entire sampling period in the leaves of esl mutant implied that a close interrelationship existed between AsA level and APX activity in the ongoing senescence of rice leaves. The GSH supply in rice leaves was not the limiting factor for the efficient maintenance of AsA-GSH cycle, despite the senescence-related change in GR activity between the two rice genotypes.
25449122	Functional characterization of a type 3 metallolthionein isoform (OsMTI-3a) from rice.	2015	Int J Biol Macromol	Metallothioneins (MTs) are low-molecular weight proteins with high Cys content and a high affinity for metals. Plant MTs are classified into four types based on the arrangement of Cys in their amino acid sequences. In the present study, the gene encoding OsMTI-3a, a type 3 MT found in rice, was cloned into pET41a vector. The resulting construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3). Following the induction with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, the OsMTI-3a was expressed as glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein. In comparison to control strain, the cells expressing GST-OsMTI-3a accumulated more Cd(2+), Ni(2+) and Zn(2+) when they were grown in the medium containing CdCl2, NiCl2 or ZnSO4. The recombinant GST-OsMTI-3a was purified using affinity chromatography. The UV absorption spectra recorded after the reconstitution of the apo-protein with different metals confirmed that GST-OsMTI-3a was able to form complexes with Cd(2+), Ni(2+), and Zn(2+). The reaction of the protein-metal complexes with 5-5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic) revealed that the order of affinity of GST-OsMTI-3a toward different metals was Ni(2+)≥Cd(2+)>Zn(2+)>Cu(2+).
25578276	Spatiotemporal distribution of phenolamides and the genetics of natural variation of hydroxycinnamoyl spermidine in rice.	2015	Mol Plant	Phenolamides constitute a diverse class of secondary metabolites that are found ubiquitously in plants and have been implicated to play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, such as plant development and defense. However, spatiotemporal accumulation patterns of phenolamides in rice, one of the most important crops, are not available, and no gene responsible for phenolamide biosynthesis has been identified in this species. In this study, we report the comprehensive metabolic profiling and natural variation analysis of phenolamides in a collection of rice germplasm using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics method. Spatiotemporal controlled accumulations were observed for most phenolamides, together with their differential accumulations between the two major subspecies of rice. Further metabolic genome-wide association study (mGWAS) in rice leaf and in vivo metabolic analysis of the transgenic plants identified Os12g27220 and Os12g27254 as two spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases that might underlie the natural variation of levels of spermidine conjugates in rice. Our work demonstrates that gene-to-metabolite analysis by mGWAS provides a useful tool for functional gene identification and omics-based crop genetic improvement.
25487714	Development of disease-resistant rice by optimized expression of WRKY45.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	The rice transcription factor WRKY45 plays a central role in the salicylic acid signalling pathway and mediates chemical-induced resistance to multiple pathogens, including Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Previously, we reported that rice transformants overexpressing WRKY45 driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter were strongly resistant to both pathogens; however, their growth and yield were negatively affected because of the trade-off between the two conflicting traits. Also, some unknown environmental factor(s) exacerbated this problem. Here, we report the development of transgenic rice lines resistant to both pathogens and with agronomic traits almost comparable to those of wild-type rice. This was achieved by optimizing the promoter driving WRKY45 expression. We isolated 16 constitutive promoters from rice genomic DNA and tested their ability to drive WRKY45 expression. Comparisons among different transformant lines showed that, overall, the strength of WRKY45 expression was positively correlated with disease resistance and negatively correlated with agronomic traits. We conducted field trials to evaluate the growth of transgenic and control lines. The agronomic traits of two lines expressing WRKY45 driven by the OsUbi7 promoter (PO sUbi7 lines) were nearly comparable to those of untransformed rice, and both lines were pathogen resistant. Interestingly, excessive WRKY45 expression rendered rice plants sensitive to low temperature and salinity, and stress sensitivity was correlated with the induction of defence genes by these stresses. These negative effects were barely observed in the PO sUbi7 lines. Moreover, their patterns of defence gene expression were similar to those in plants primed by chemical defence inducers.
25505033	Comparison of plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from rice: identification of two plant-specific regulatory regions of the allosteric enzyme.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a key enzyme of primary metabolism in bacteria, algae and vascular plants, and it undergoes allosteric regulation by various metabolic effectors. Rice (Oryza sativa) has five plant-type PEPCs, four cytosolic and one chloroplastic. We investigated their kinetic properties using recombinant proteins and found that, like most plant-type PEPCs, rice cytosolic isozymes were activated by glucose 6-phosphate and by alkaline pH. In contrast, no such activation was observed for the chloroplastic isozyme, Osppc4. In addition, Osppc4 showed low affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and very low sensitivities to allosteric inhibitors aspartate and glutamate. By comparing the isozyme amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures simulated on the basis of the reported crystal structures, we identified two regions where Osppc4 has unique features that can be expected to affect its kinetic properties. One is the N-terminal extension; replacement of the extension of Osppc2a (cytosolic) with that from Osppc4 reduced the aspartate and glutamate sensitivities to about one-tenth of the wild-type values but left the PEP affinity unaffected. The other is the N-terminal loop, in which a conserved lysine at the N-terminal end is replaced with a glutamate-alanine pair in Osppc4. Replacement of the lysine of Osppc2a with glutamate-alanine lowered the PEP affinity to a quarter of the wild-type level (down to the Osppc4 level), without affecting inhibitor sensitivity. Both the N-terminal extension and the N-terminal loop are specific to plant-type PEPCs, suggesting that plant-type isozymes acquired these regions so that their activity could be regulated properly at the sites where they function.
25486886	Over-expression of a glutamate dehydrogenase gene, MgGDH, from Magnaporthe grisea confers tolerance to dehydration stress in transgenic rice.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Heterologous expression of a fungal NADP(H)-GDH gene ( MgGDH ) from Magnaporthe grisea can improve dehydration stress tolerance in rice by preventing toxic accumulation of ammonium. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2 and EC 1.4.1.4) may act as a stress-responsive enzyme in detoxification of high intracellular ammonia and production of glutamate for proline synthesis under stress conditions. In present study, a fungal NADP(H)-GDH gene (MgGDH) from Magnaporthe grisea was over-expressed in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. 'kitaake'), and the transgenic plants showed the improvement of tolerance to dehydration stress. The kinetic analysis showed that His-TF-MgGDH preferentially utilizes ammonium to produce L-glutamate. Moreover, the affinity of His-TF-MgGDH for ammonium was dramatically higher than that of His-TF-OsGDH for ammonium. Over-expressing MgGDH transgenic rice plants showed lower water-loss rate and higher completely close stomata than the wild-type plants under dehydration stress conditions. In transgenic plants, the NADP(H)-GDH activities were markedly higher than those in wild-type plants and the amination activity was significantly higher than the deamination activity. Compared with wild-type plants, the transgenic plants accumulated much less NH4 (+) but higher amounts of glutamate, proline and soluble sugar under dehydration stress conditions. These results indicate that heterologous expression of MgGDH can prevent toxic accumulation of ammonium and in return improve dehydration stress tolerance in rice.
25515696	Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Most agronomically important traits, including resistance against pathogens, are governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL). QTL-mediated resistance shows promise of being effective and long-lasting against diverse pathogens. Identification of genes controlling QTL-based disease resistance contributes to breeding for cultivars that exhibit high and stable resistance. Several defense response genes have been successfully used as good predictors and contributors to QTL-based resistance against several devastating rice diseases. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant line containing a 750 bp deletion in the second exon of OsPAL4, a member of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family. OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2. Self-pollination of heterozygous ospal4 mutant lines produced no homozygous progeny, suggesting that homozygosity for the mutation is lethal. The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast. Mutation of OsPAL4 increased expression of the OsPAL2 gene and decreased the expression of the unlinked OsPAL6 gene. OsPAL2 function is not redundant because the changes in expression did not compensate for loss of disease resistance. OsPAL6 co-localizes with a QTL for rice blast resistance, and is down-regulated in the ospal4 mutant line; this may explain enhanced susceptibility to Magnoporthe oryzae. Overall, these results suggest that OsPAL4 and possibly OsPAL6 are key contributors to resistance governed by QTL and are potential breeding targets for improved broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.
25543954	A nuclear-localized histone-gene binding protein from rice (OsHBP1b) functions in salinity and drought stress tolerance by maintaining chlorophyll content and improving the antioxidant machinery.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Plants have evolved a number of molecular strategies and regulatory mechanisms to cope with abiotic stresses. Among the various key factors/regulators, transcription factors (TFs) play critical role(s) towards regulating the gene expression patterns in response to stress conditions. Altering the expression of the key TFs can greatly influence plant stress tolerance. OsHBP1b (accession no. KM096571) is one such TF belonging to bZIP family, localized within the Saltol QTL, whose expression is induced upon salinity treatment in the rice seedlings. qRT-PCR based expression studies for OsHBP1b in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice showed its differential regulation in response to salinity stress. A GFP based in vivo study showed that the OsHBP1b protein is nuclear localized and possesses the trans-activation activity. As compared to the WT tobacco plants, the transgenic plants ectopically expressing OsHBP1b showed better survival and favourable osmotic parameters (such as germination and survival rate, membrane stability, K(+)/Na(+) ratio, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and proline contents) under salinity and drought stress. Under salinity conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen species as compared to the WT. It was also accompanied by higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (such as ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), thereby demonstrating that transgenic plants are physiologically better adapted towards the oxidative damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsHBP1b contributes to abiotic stress tolerance through multiple physiological pathways and thus, may serve as a useful 'candidate gene' for improving multiple stress tolerance in crop plants.
25541357	Thioredoxin h isoforms from rice are differentially reduced by NADPH/thioredoxin or GSH/glutaredoxin systems.	2015	Int J Biol Macromol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has multiple potential genes encoding thioredoxin (Trx) h and NADP-thioredoxin reductase (NTR). These NTR and Trx h isoforms, known as cytoplasmic NTR/Trx system along with multiple members of glutaredoxin (Grx) family constitute a complex redox control system in rice. In the present study, we investigated the kinetic parameters of two rice NTRs, OsNTRA and OsNTRB, toward three endogenous Trx h isoforms, OsTrx1, OsTrx20, and OsTrx23. The results showed that in contrast with OsTrx1 and OsTrx23, the isoform OsTrx20 was not reduced by OsNTR isoforms. The kcat/Km values of OsNTRB and OsNTRA toward OsTrx1 was six- and 13-fold higher than those values toward OsTrx23, respectively, suggesting that OsNTR isoforms do not reduce different OsTrx h isoforms, equivalently. Furthermore, the possible reduction of OsTrx isoforms by the glutathione (GSH)/Grx system was investigated through the heterologous expression of a gene encoding OsGrx9, a bicysteinic CPYC Grx found in rice. Whereas OsTrx23 was not reduced by GSH, OsTrx20 and with less efficiently OsTrx1 were reduced by GSH or GSH/Grx. Therefore, it seems that OsTrx1 can be reduced either by OsNTR or GSH/Grx. These data for the first time provides an evidence for cross-talking between NTR/Trx and GSH/Grx systems in rice.
25496595	Rhizoxin analogs contribute to the biocontrol activity of a newly isolated pseudomonas strain.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Two strains of Pseudomonas sp., Os17 and St29, were newly isolated from the rhizosphere of rice and potato, respectively, by screening for 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol producers. These strains were found to be the same species and were the closest to but different from Pseudomonas protegens among the sequenced pseudomonads, based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene and whole-genome analyses. Strain Os17 was as effective a biocontrol agent as reported for P. protegens Cab57, whereas strain St29 was less effective. The whole-genome sequences of these strains were obtained: the genomes are organized into a single circular chromosome with 6,885,464 bp, 63.5% G+C content, and 6,195 coding sequences for strain Os17; and with 6,833,117 bp, 63.3% G+C content, and 6,217 coding sequences for strain St29. Comparative genome analysis of these strains revealed that the complete rhizoxin analog biosynthesis gene cluster (approximately 79 kb) found in the Os17 genome was absent from the St29 genome. In an rzxB mutant, which lacks the polyketide synthase essential for the production of rhizoxin analogs, the growth inhibition activity against fungal and oomycete pathogens and the plant protection efficacy were attenuated compared with those of wild-type Os17. These findings suggest that rhizoxin analogs are important biocontrol factors of this strain.
25404280	SAD1, an RNA polymerase I subunit A34.5 of rice, interacts with Mediator and controls various aspects of plant development.	2015	Plant J	The DWARF14 (D14) gene of rice functions within the signaling pathway of strigolactones, a group of plant hormones that inhibits shoot branching. We isolated a recessive mutant named super apical dormant (sad1-1) from a suppressor screen of d14-1. The growth of tillers (vegetative shoot branches) is suppressed in both the d14-1 sad1-1 double mutant and the sad1-1 single mutant. In addition, the sad1-1 mutant shows pleiotropic defects throughout development. SAD1 encodes an ortholog of RPA34.5, a subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Consequently, the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is severely reduced in the sad1-1 mutant. These results indicate that proper ribosome function is a prerequisite for normal development in plants. The Arabidopsis ortholog of SAD1 was previously isolated as a Mediator-interacting protein. Here we show that SAD1 interacts physically with the Mediator complex through direct binding with OsMED4, a component of the middle module of the Mediator complex in rice. It is known that Mediator interacts with Pol II, which transcribes mRNAs and functions as a central regulator of transcription. This study indicates a novel aspect of Mediator function in Pol I-controlled rRNA transcription. TFIIF2 and RPC53 are the counterparts of RPA34.5 in Pol II and Pol III, respectively. We demonstrate that the rice orthologs of these proteins also interact with OsMED4. Our results suggest that interaction with MED4 in the Mediator complex is a common feature of the three types of RNA polymerases.
25496090	Cooling water before panicle initiation increases chilling-induced male sterility and disables chilling-induced expression of genes encoding OsFKBP65 and heat shock proteins in rice spikelets.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), chilling-induced male sterility increased when plants experienced low water temperature (Tw , 18 °C for 14 d) before panicle initiation. The number of mature pollen grains after chilling at the booting stage (12 °C for 5 d) was only 45% of total pollen grains in low-Tw plants, whereas it was 71% in normal-Tw plants (Tw not controlled; approximately 23 °C under air temperature of 26 °C/21 °C, day/night). Microarray and quantitative PCR analyses showed that many stress-responsive genes (including OsFKBP65 and genes encoding the large heat shock protein OsHSP90.1, heat-stress transcription factors and many small heat shock proteins) were strongly up-regulated by chilling in normal-Tw spikelets, but were unaffected or even down-regulated by chilling in low-Tw spikelets. OsAPX2 and genes encoding some other antioxidant enzymes were also significantly down-regulated by low Tw in chilled spikelets. The levels of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde equivalents) were significantly increased in low-Tw spikelets by chilling. Ascorbate peroxidase activity in chilled spikelets was significantly lower in low-Tw plants than in normal-Tw plants. Our data suggest that an OsFKBP65-related chilling response, which protects proteins from oxidative damage, is indispensable for chilling tolerance but is lost in low-Tw spikelets.
25429996	Lack of cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 in vascular tissues of axillary buds causes severe reduction in their outgrowth and disorder of metabolic balance in rice seedlings.	2015	Plant J	The development and elongation of active tillers in rice was severely reduced by a lack of cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 (GS1;2), and, to a lesser extent, lack of NADH-glutamate synthase1 in knockout mutants. In situ hybridization using the basal part of wild-type seedlings clearly showed that expression of OsGS1;2 was detected in the phloem companion cells of the nodal vascular anastomoses and large vascular bundles of axillary buds. Accumulation of lignin, visualized using phloroglucin HCl, was also observed in these tissues. The lack of GS1;2 resulted in reduced accumulation of lignin. Re-introduction into the mutants of OsGS1;2 cDNA under the control of its own promoter successfully restored the outgrowth of tillers and lignin deposition to wild-type levels. Transcriptomic analysis using a 5 mm basal region of rice shoots showed that the GS1;2 mutants accumulated reduced amounts of mRNAs for carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including C1 unit transfer in lignin synthesis. Although a high content of strigolactone in rice roots is known to reduce active tiller number, the reduction of outgrowth of axillary buds observed in the GS1;2 mutants was independent of the level of strigolactone. Thus metabolic disorder caused by the lack of GS1;2 resulted in a severe reduction in the outgrowth of axillary buds and lignin deposition.
25523384	Expression of a cyclophilin OsCyp2-P isolated from a salt-tolerant landrace of rice in tobacco alleviates stress via ion homeostasis and limiting ROS accumulation.	2015	Funct Integr Genomics	Cyclophilins are a set of ubiquitous proteins present in all subcellular compartments, involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis genomes led us to identify novel putative cyclophilin gene family members in both the genomes not reported previously. We grouped cyclophilin members with similar molecular weight and subtypes together in the phylogenetic tree which indicated their co-evolution in rice and Arabidopsis. We also characterized a rice cyclophilin gene, OsCyp2-P (Os02g0121300), isolated from a salinity-tolerant landrace, Pokkali. Publicly available massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and microarray data, besides our quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) data suggest that transcript abundance of OsCyp2-P is regulated under different stress conditions in a developmental and organ specific manner. Ectopic expression of OsCyp2-P imparted multiple abiotic stress tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants as evidenced by higher root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, and K(+)/Na(+) ratio under stress conditions. Transgenic plants also showed reduced lipid peroxidase content, electrolyte leakage, and superoxide content under stress conditions suggesting better ion homeostasis than WT plants. Localization studies confirmed that OsCyp2-P is localized in both cytosol and nucleus, indicating its possible interaction with several other proteins. The overall results suggest the explicit role of OsCyp2-P in bestowing multiple abiotic stress tolerance at the whole plant level. OsCyp2-P operates via reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and ion homeostasis and thus is a promising candidate gene for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.
25547963	Na+ and Cl(-) ions show additive effects under NaCl stress on induction of oxidative stress and the responsive antioxidative defense in rice.	2015	Protoplasma	Despite the fact that when subjected to salinity stress most plants accumulate high concentrations of sodium (Na(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) ions in their tissues, major research has however been focused on the toxic effects of Na(+). Consequently, Cl(-) toxicity mechanisms in annual plants, particularly in inducing oxidative stress, are poorly understood. Here, the extent to which Na(+) and/or Cl(-) ions contribute in inducing oxidative stress and regulating the adaptive antioxidant defense is shown in two Indica rice genotypes differing in their salt tolerance. Equimolar (100 mM) concentrations of Na(+), Cl(-), and NaCl (EC ≈ 10 dS m(-1)) generated free-radical (O2 (•-), (•)OH) and non-radical (H2O2) forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggered cell death in leaves of 21-day-old hydroponically grown rice seedlings as evident by spectrophotometric quantifications and histochemical visualizations. The magnitude of ROS-mediated oxidative damage was higher in sensitive cultivar, whereas NaCl proved to be most toxic among the treatments. Salt treatments significantly increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and their isozymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. Na(+) and Cl(-) ions showed additive effects under NaCl in activating the antioxidant enzyme machinery, and responses were more pronounced in tolerant cultivar. The expression levels of SodCc2, CatA, and OsPRX1 genes were largely consistent with the activities of their corresponding enzymes. Salt treatments caused an imbalance in non-enzymatic antioxidants ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, and polyphenols, with greater impacts under NaCl than Na(+) and Cl(-) separately. Results revealed that though Cl(-) was relatively less toxic than its counter-cation, its effects cannot be totally ignored. Both the cultivars responded in the same manner, but the tolerant cultivar maintained lower Na(+)/K(+) and ROS levels coupled with better antioxidant defense under all three salt treatments.
25267613	Bacterial quorum sensing and metabolic slowing in a cooperative population.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing (QS) controls the production of numerous intra- and extracellular products across many species of Proteobacteria. Although these cooperative activities are often costly at an individual level, they provide significant benefits to the group. Other potential roles for QS include the restriction of nutrient acquisition and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis of individual cells in a crowded but cooperative population. Under crowded conditions, QS may function to modulate and coordinate nutrient utilization and the homeostatic primary metabolism of individual cells. Here, we show that QS down-regulates glucose uptake, substrate level and oxidative phosphorylation, and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis via the activity of the QS-dependent transcriptional regulator QsmR (quorum sensing master regulator R) in the rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae. Systematic analysis of glucose uptake and core primary metabolite levels showed that QS deficiency perturbed nutrient acquisition, and energy and nucleotide metabolism, of individuals within the group. The QS mutants grew more rapidly than the wild type at the early exponential stage and outcompeted wild-type cells in coculture. Metabolic slowing of individuals in a QS-dependent manner indicates that QS acts as a metabolic brake on individuals when cells begin to mass, implying a mechanism by which AHL-mediated QS might have evolved to ensure homeostasis of the primary metabolism of individuals under crowded conditions.
25271318	Rice SPX1 and SPX2 inhibit phosphate starvation responses through interacting with PHR2 in a phosphate-dependent manner.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In plants, sensing the levels of external and internal nutrients is essential for reprogramming the transcriptome and adapting to the fluctuating environment. Phosphate (Pi) is a key plant nutrient, and a large proportion of Pi starvation-responsive genes are under the control of Phosphate Starvation Response Regulator 1 (PHR1) in Arabidopsis (AtPHR1) and its homologs, such as Oryza sativa (Os)PHR2 in rice. AtPHR1 and OsPHR2 expression is not very responsive to Pi starvation, raising the question as to how plants sense changes in cellular Pi levels to activate the central regulator. SPX [named after SYG1 (suppressor of yeast gpa1), Pho81 (CDK inhibitor in yeast PHO pathway), and XPR1 (xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor)] proteins that harbor only the SPX domain are reported to be involved in the negative regulation of Pi starvation responses. Here, we show that the nuclear localized SPX proteins SPX1 and SPX2 are Pi-dependent inhibitors of the activity of OsPHR2 in rice. Indeed, SPX1 and SPX2 proteins interact with PHR2 through their SPX domain, inhibiting its binding to P1BS (the PHR1-binding sequence: GNATATNC). In vivo data, as well as results from in vitro experiments using purified SPX1, SPX2, and OsPHR2 proteins, showed that SPX1 and SPX2 inhibition of OsPHR2 activity is Pi-dependent. These data provide evidence to support the involvement of SPX1 and SPX2 in the Pi-sensing mechanism in plants.
25186728	Producing more grain with lower environmental costs.	2014	Nature	Agriculture faces great challenges to ensure global food security by increasing yields while reducing environmental costs. Here we address this challenge by conducting a total of 153 site-year field experiments covering the main agro-ecological areas for rice, wheat and maize production in China. A set of integrated soil-crop system management practices based on a modern understanding of crop ecophysiology and soil biogeochemistry increases average yields for rice, wheat and maize from 7.2 million grams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), 7.2 Mg ha(-1) and 10.5 Mg ha(-1) to 8.5 Mg ha(-1), 8.9 Mg ha(-1) and 14.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively, without any increase in nitrogen fertilizer. Model simulation and life-cycle assessment show that reactive nitrogen losses and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced substantially by integrated soil-crop system management. If farmers in China could achieve average grain yields equivalent to 80% of this treatment by 2030, over the same planting area as in 2012, total production of rice, wheat and maize in China would be more than enough to meet the demand for direct human consumption and a substantially increased demand for animal feed, while decreasing the environmental costs of intensive agriculture.
25212867	Isolation and identification of an allelopathic phenylethylamine in rice.	2014	Phytochemistry	Allelopathy is the process whereby an organic chemical (allelochemical) released from one plant influences the growth and development of other plants. Allelochemicals produced by specific rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars have potential to manage barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), a major yield-limiting weed species in rice production systems in Asia and North America. In this study, isolation and identification of an allelopathic compound, N-trans-cinnamoyltyramine (NTCT), in a Vietnamese rice cultivar 'OM 5930' was accomplished through bioassay-guided purification using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with spectroscopic techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry, high resolution mass spectrometry, as well as one-dimensional and two-dimensional (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The identified compound, NTCT is considered a β-phenylethylamine. NTCT inhibited root and hypocotyl growth of cress (Lepidium sativum L.), barnyard grass and red sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis L. Nees) at concentrations as low as 0.24 μM. The ED50 (concentration required for 50% inhibition) of NTCT on barnyard grass root and hypocotyl elongation were 1.35 and 1.85 μM, respectively. Results further demonstrated that mortality of barnyard grass and red sprangletop seedlings was >80% at a concentration of 2.4 μM of NTCT. By 20 days after transplanting, 0.425 nmol of NTCT per OM 5930 rice seedling was released into the culture solution. With concentrations of 42 μg g(-1) fresh weight, production of NTCT in intact rice plants can be considered high. These findings suggest that developing plants of Vietnamese rice cultivar OM 5930 release NTCT and may be utilized to suppress barnyard grass in rice fields. The potency of NTCT may encourage development of this compound as a bio-herbicide.
25253891	Novel coding, translation, and gene expression of a replicating covalently closed circular RNA of 220 nt.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The highly structured (64% GC) covalently closed circular (CCC) RNA (220 nt) of the virusoid associated with rice yellow mottle virus codes for a 16-kDa highly basic protein using novel modalities for coding, translation, and gene expression. This CCC RNA is the smallest among all known viroids and virusoids and the only one that codes proteins. Its sequence possesses an internal ribosome entry site and is directly translated through two (or three) completely overlapping ORFs (shifting to a new reading frame at the end of each round). The initiation and termination codons overlap UGAUGA (underline highlights the initiation codon AUG within the combined initiation-termination sequence). Termination codons can be ignored to obtain larger read-through proteins. This circular RNA with no noncoding sequences is a unique natural supercompact "nanogenome."
25162803	An evolutionary genomic tale of two rice species.	2014	Nat Genet	The domestication of African rice, Oryza glaberrima, occurred separately from that of the much more widespread Asian rice species Oryza sativa. Analysis of the whole-genome sequence for O. glaberrima shows the extent to which the same genes were involved in these distinct but parallel evolutionary events.
25218040	Overexpression of the OsChI1 gene, encoding a putative laccase precursor, increases tolerance to drought and salinity stress in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2014	Gene	In a previous study, we identified a number of genes induced by chilling using a microarray approach. In order to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying chilling tolerance and possible crosstalk with other abiotic stresses, we selected a rice gene, OsChI1 (Os01g61160), for further analysis. The OsChI1 gene encodes a putative laccase precursor protein. In accordance with our previous results, its transcript is highly accumulated during a 12-day period of chilling treatment. Higher expression of the OsChI1 gene was also detected in roots and tissues at the vegetative and productive stages. In addition, we also observed increased transcript levels of the OsChI1 gene during dehydration and high salinity conditions. Transient expression of OsChI1 proteins tagged with fluorescence protein in rice protoplasts revealed that OsChI1 is localized in the plasma membrane. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsChI1-EGFP resulted in an increased tolerance to drought and salinity stress. In silico analysis of OsChI1 suggests that several genes coexpressed with OsChI1 in the root during various abiotic stresses, such as chilling, drought and salt stress, may play an important role in the ROS signaling pathway. Potential roles of OsChI1 in response to abiotic stresses are discussed.
25236158	Identification of rice Di19 family reveals OsDi19-4 involved in drought resistance.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The OsDi19 proteins functioned as transcription factors and played crucial roles in response to abiotic stress. Overexpression of OsDi19-4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity. Many transcription factors play crucial roles in plant responses to abiotic stress. Here, comprehensive sequence analysis suggested that the drought-induced 19 (Di19) gene family in rice genome contain seven members, and these proteins contained a well-conserved zinc-finger Di19 domain. Most OsDi19 proteins were mainly targeted to the nucleus and have transactivation activity in yeast. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that most OsDi19 proteins could form protein dimers. Expression analysis demonstrated that the OsDi19 genes were differentially and abundantly expressed in vegetative tissues, but expressed little in reproductive tissues and some of the OsDi19 genes were markedly induced by abiotic stresses and hormones in qRT-PCR analysis and microarray data. Overexpression of one stress-responsive gene, OsDi19-4, in rice resulted in significantly increased tolerance to drought stress compared with the wild type plants. Moreover, obviously increased ROS-scavenging ability was detected in the OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants under normal and drought stress conditions. These results suggested that the increased stress tolerance of OsDi19-4-overexpressing plants may be attributable to the enhanced ROS-scavenging activity. Taken together, these studies provide a detailed overview of the rice Di19 gene family, and suggest that the OsDi19 family may play crucial roles in the plant response to abiotic stress.
25309566	Diversification of the plant-specific hybrid glycine-rich protein (HyGRP) genes in cereals.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Plant-specific hybrid proline- or glycine-rich proteins (HyP/GRPs) are involved in diverse gene functions including plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, enhances seed germination in rice under low-temperature conditions and encodes a member with a glycine-rich motif of the HyP/GRP family. The function of this gene may be related to the weakening of tissue covering the embryo during seed germination. In the present study, the diversification of the HyP/GRP gene family was elucidated in rice based on phylogenetic relationships and gene expression levels. At least 21 members of the HyP/GRP family have been identified in the rice genome and clustered in five regions on four chromosomes by tandem and chromosomal duplications. Of these, OsHyPRP05 (qLTG3-1) and its paralogous gene, OsHyPRP21, had a glycine-rich motif. Furthermore, orthologous genes with a glycine-rich motif and the HyP/GRP gene family were detected in four genome-sequenced monocots: 12 in barley, 10 in Brachypodium, 20 in maize, and 28 in sorghum, using a BLAST search of qLTG3-1 as the query. All members of the HyP/GRP family in these five species were classified into seven main groups, which were clustered together in these species. These results suggested that the HyP/GRP gene family was formed in the ancestral genome before the divergence of these species. The collinearity of chromosomal regions around qLTG3-1 and its orthologous genes were conserved among rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and maize, indicating that qLTG3-1 and orthologous genes conserve gene function during seed germination.
25209128	OsAAP6 functions as an important regulator of grain protein content and nutritional quality in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	Grains from cereals contribute an important source of protein to human food, and grain protein content (GPC) is an important determinant of nutritional quality in cereals. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) qPC1 in rice controls GPC by regulating the synthesis and accumulation of glutelins, prolamins, globulins, albumins and starch. qPC1 encodes a putative amino acid transporter OsAAP6, which functions as a positive regulator of GPC in rice, such that higher expression of OsAAP6 is correlated with higher GPC. OsAAP6 greatly enhances root absorption of a range of amino acids and has effects on the distribution of various amino acids. Two common variations in the potential cis-regulatory elements of the OsAAP6 5'-untranslated region seem to be associated with GPC diversity mainly in indica cultivars. Our results represent the first step toward unravelling the mechanism of regulation underlying natural variation of GPC in rice.
25238655	Zinc deficiency differentially affects redox homeostasis of rice genotypes contrasting in ascorbate level.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Zinc (Zn) deficiency is an important mineral disorder affecting rice production, and is associated with the formation of oxidative stress in plant tissue. In this study we investigated processes of oxidative stress formation as affected by ascorbate (AsA) in two pairs of contrasting rice genotypes: (i) two indica lines differing in field tolerance to Zn deficiency and AsA metabolism, i.e. RIL46 (tolerant) and IR74 (sensitive); (ii) the japonica wild-type Nipponbare (tolerant) and the AsA deficient TOS17 mutant line ND6172 (sensitive) having a 20-30% lower AsA level due to the knockout of an AsA biosynthetic gene (OsGME1). Plants were grown hydroponically under +Zn and -Zn conditions for 21 days and samples were investigated after 7, 14, and 21 days of treatment. Tissue Zn concentrations below 20mg kg(-1) in the -Zn treatment induced the formation of visible symptoms of Zn deficiency from day 14 in all genotypes, but especially in the sensitive IR74. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation were observed in the leaves of the sensitive genotypes IR74 and ND6172, and in the roots of IR74, but not in the tolerant genotypes. At day 21, the tolerant genotypes RIL46 and Nipponbare had significantly higher AsA levels in both shoots and roots compared to the sensitive lines. Consistently, higher levels of hydrogen peroxide formation in leaves and roots of the sensitive genotypes were detected using staining methods. Differences in foliar hydrogen peroxide formation between IR74 and RIL46 became apparent on day 7 and between ND6172 and Nipponbare on day 14. Similarly, genotypic differences in hydrogen peroxide formation in the roots were seen on day 21. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Zn deficiency leads to a redox imbalance in roots and shoots prior to the occurrence of visible symptoms, and that the antioxidant AsA plays an important role in maintaining the redox homeostasis under Zn deficiency.
24964058	Targeted gene disruption of OsCERK1 reveals its indispensable role in chitin perception and involvement in the peptidoglycan response and immunity in rice.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	OsCERK1 is a rice receptor-like kinase that mediates the signal of a fungal cell wall component, chitin, by coordinating with a lysin motif (LysM)-containing protein CEBiP. To further elucidate the function of OsCERK1 in the defense response, we disrupted OsCERK1 using an Agrobacterium-mediated gene targeting system based on homologous recombination. In OsCERK1-disrupted lines, the generation of hydrogen peroxide and the alteration of gene expression in response to a chitin oligomer were completely abolished. The OsCERK1-disrupted lines also showed lowered responsiveness to a bacterial cell wall component, peptidoglycan. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsCERK1 interacts with the LysM-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6, which are known to participate in the peptidoglycan response in rice. Observation of the infection behavior of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) revealed that disruption of OsCERK1 led to increased hyphal growth in leaf sheath cells. Green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCERK1 was localized around the primary infection hyphae. These results demonstrate that OsCERK1 is indispensable for chitin perception and participates in innate immunity in rice, and also mediates the peptidoglycan response. It is also suggested that OsCERK1 mediates the signaling pathways of both fungal and bacterial molecular patterns by interacting with different LysM-containing receptor-like proteins.
25184028	OsSUV3 transgenic rice maintains higher endogenous levels of plant hormones that mitigates adverse effects of salinity and sustains crop productivity.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The SUV3 (suppressor of Var 3) gene encodes a DNA and RNA helicase, which is localized in the mitochondria. Plant SUV3 has not yet been characterized in detail. However, the Arabidopsis ortholog of SUV3 (AT4G14790) has been shown to be involved in embryo sac development. Previously, we have reported that rice SUV3 functions as DNA and RNA helicase and provides salinity stress tolerance by maintaining photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery. Here, we report further analysis of the transgenic OsSUV3 rice plants under salt stress.

FINDINGS: The transgenic OsSUV3 overexpressing rice T1 lines showed significantly higher endogenous content of plant hormones viz., gibberellic acid (GA3), zeatin (Z) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in leaf, stem and root as compared to wild-type (WT), vector control (VC) and antisense (AS) plants under salt (200 mM NaCl) stress condition. A similar trend of endogenous plant hormones profile was also reflected in the T2 generation of OsSUV3 transgenic rice under defined parameters and stress condition.

CONCLUSIONS: In response to stress, OsSUV3 rice plants maintained plant hormone levels that regulate the expression of several stress-induced genes and reduce adverse effects of salt on plant growth and development and therefore sustains crop productivity.
25255828	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Grain size is one of the most important determinants of crop yield in cereals. Here, we identified a dominant mutant, big grain2 (bg2-D) from our enhancer-trapping population. Genetic analysis and SiteFinding PCR (polymerase chain reaction) revealed that BG2 encodes a cytochrome P450, OsCYP78A13. Sequence search revealed that CYP78A13 has a paralogue Grain Length 3.2 (GL3.2, LOC_Os03g30420) in rice with distinct expression patterns, analysis of transgenic plants harbouring either CYP78A13 or GL3.2 showed that both can promote grain growth. Sequence polymorphism analysis with 1529 rice varieties showed that the nucleotide diversity at CYP78A13 gene body and the 20 kb flanking region in the indica varieties were markedly higher than those in japonica varieties. Further, comparison of the genomic sequence of CYP78A13 in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare and the indica cultivar 9311 showed that there were three InDels in the promoter region and eight SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) in its coding sequence. Detailed examination of the transgenic plants with chimaeric constructs suggested that variation in CYP78A13 coding region is responsible for the variation of grain yield. Taken together, our results suggest that the variations in CYP78A13 in the indica varieties hold potential in rice breeding for application of grain yield improvement.
25255693	An alternatively spliced heat shock transcription factor, OsHSFA2dI, functions in the heat stress-induced unfolded protein response in rice.	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	As sessile organisms, plants have evolved a wide range of defence pathways to cope with environmental stress such as heat shock. However, the molecular mechanism of these defence pathways remains unclear in rice. In this study, we found that OsHSFA2d, a heat shock transcriptional factor, encodes two main splice variant proteins, OsHSFA2dI and OsHSFA2dII in rice. Under normal conditions, OsHSFA2dII is the dominant but transcriptionally inactive spliced form. However, when the plant suffers heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response (HSR). Further study found that this alternative splicing was induced by heat shock rather than photoperiod. We found that OsHSFA2dI is localised to the nucleus, whereas OsHSFA2dII is localised to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, expression of the unfolded protein response (UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE) sensors, OsIRE1, OsbZIP39/OsbZIP60 and the UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE marker OsBiP1, was up-regulated. Interestingly, OsbZIP50 was also alternatively spliced under heat stress, indicating that UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE signalling pathways were activated by heat stress to re-establish cellular protein homeostasis. We further demonstrated that OsHSFA2dI participated in the unfolded protein response by regulating expression of OsBiP1.
25261533	UDP-arabinopyranose mutase 3 is required for pollen wall morphogenesis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	l-Arabinose is one of the main constituents of cell wall polysaccharides such as pectic rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), glucuronoarabinoxylans and other glycoproteins. It is found predominantly in the furanose form rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf), rather than UDP-L-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap), is a sugar donor for the biosynthesis of arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. UDP-arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been shown to interconvert UDP-Araf and UDP-Arap and are involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides including Araf. The UAM gene family has three members in Oryza sativa. Co-expression network in silico analysis showed that OsUAM3 expression was independent from OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 co-expression networks. OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 were expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development, but OsUAM3 was expressed primarily in reproductive tissue, particularly at the pollen cell wall formation developmental stage. OsUAM3 co-expression networks include pectin catabolic enzymes. To determine the function of OsUAMs in reproductive tissues, we analyzed RNA interference (RNAi)-knockdown transformants (OsUAM3-KD) specific for OsUAM3. OsUAM3-KD plants grew normally and showed abnormal phenotypes in reproductive tissues, especially in terms of the pollen cell wall and exine. In addition, we examined modifications of cell wall polysaccharides at the cellular level using antibodies against polysaccharides including Araf. Immunolocalization of arabinan using the LM6 antibody showed low levels of arabinan in OsUAM3-KD pollen grains. Our results suggest that the function of OsUAM3 is important for synthesis of arabinan side chains of RG-I and is required for reproductive developmental processes, especially the formation of the cell wall in pollen.
25259844	Does the upstream region possessing MULE-like sequence in rice upregulate PsbS1 gene expression?	2014	PLoS One	The genomic nucleotide sequences of japonica rice (Sasanishiki and Nipponbare) contained about 2.7-kb unique region at the point of 0.4-kb upstream of the OsPsbS1 gene. In this study, we found that japonica rice with a few exceptions possessing such DNA sequences [denoted to OsMULE-japonica specific sequence (JSS)] is distinct by the presence of Mutator-like-element (MULE). Such sequence was absent in most of indica cultivars and Oryza glaberrima. In OsMULE-JSS1, we noted the presence of possible target site duplication (TSD; CTTTTCCAG) and about 80-bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR) near TSD. We also found the enhancement ofOsPsbS1 mRNA accumulation by intensified light, which was not associated with the DNA methylation status in OsMULE/JSS. In addition, O. rufipogon, possible ancestor of modern rice cultivars was found to compose PsbS gene of either japonica (minor) or indica (major) type. Transient gene expression assay showed that the japonica type promoter elevated a reporter gene activity than indica type.
25124817	Unraveling low-level gamma radiation--responsive changes in expression of early and late genes in leaves of rice seedlings at Iitate Village, Fukushima.	None	J Hered	In the summer of 2012, 1 year after the nuclear accident in March 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, we examined the effects of gamma radiation on rice at a highly contaminated field of Iitate village in Fukushima, Japan. We investigated the morphological and molecular changes on healthy rice seedlings exposed to continuous low-dose gamma radiation up to 4 µSv h(-1), about 80 times higher than natural background level. After exposure to gamma rays, expression profiles of selected genes involved in DNA replication/repair, oxidative stress, photosynthesis, and defense/stress functions were examined by RT-PCR, which revealed their differential expression in leaves in a time-dependent manner over 3 days (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). For example, OsPCNA mRNA rapidly increased at 6, 12, and 24 h, suggesting that rice cells responded to radiation stress by activating a gene involved in DNA repair mechanisms. At 72 h, genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway (OsPAL2) and cell death (OsPR1oa) were strongly induced, indicating activation of defense/stress responses. We next profiled the transcriptome using a customized rice whole-genome 4×44K DNA microarray at early (6h) and late (72 h) time periods. Low-level gamma radiation differentially regulated rice leaf gene expression (induced 4481 and suppressed 3740 at 6 h and induced 2291 and suppressed 1474 genes at 72 h) by at least 2-fold. Using the highly upregulated and downregulated gene list, MapMan bioinformatics tool generated diagrams of early and late pathways operating in cells responding to gamma ray exposure. An inventory of a large number of gamma radiation-responsive genes provides new information on novel regulatory processes in rice.
25266270	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK) proteins play pivotal roles in regulation of plant development and immunity. The rice genome contains two SERK genes, OsSerk1 and OsSerk2. We previously demonstrated that OsSerk2 is required for rice Xa21-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and for normal development. Here we report the molecular characterization of OsSerk1. Overexpression of OsSerk1 results in a semi-dwarf phenotype whereas silencing of OsSerk1 results in a reduced angle of the lamina joint. OsSerk1 is not required for rice resistance to Xoo or Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of OsSerk1 in OsSerk2-silenced lines complements phenotypes associated with brassinosteroid (BR) signaling defects, but not the disease resistance phenotype mediated by Xa21. In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively. OsSERK1 is a functional protein kinase capable of auto-phosphorylation in vitro. We conclude that, whereas OsSERK2 regulates both rice development and immunity, OsSERK1 functions in rice development but not immunity to Xoo and M. oryzae.
25042706	Bacterial-induced expression of RAB18 protein in Orzya sativa salinity stress and insights into molecular interaction with GTP ligand.	2014	J Mol Recognit	In the present research, we have studied the inoculation effects of two root-associated plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in rice and provide the pieces of evidence that the inoculation of the PGPR could potentially result in inducing the expression of the salt stress-related RAB18 plant gene under varying degrees of salinity stress. The sequenced putative gene of RAB18 of Oryza sativa in this study is 740 bp long, has a content of 44.4%, and a molecular weight of 492 102.00 Da. BLAST homology patterns revealed sequence similarity with the previously sequenced RAB in model plant species. We demonstrate the mode of action of this stress-related protein by performing comparative modeling of Q10RT8 (Os03g0146000 protein, homolog of the sequenced RAB18; O. sativa subsp. japonica) using energy minimization, molecular dynamic simulations, and molecular docking of a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) ligand with the protein. The docking results indicated that Ser21, Ala22, Lys25, Asp68, Ala70, Glu73, and Arg74 are important determinant residues for functional interaction with the GTP ligand. The present research contributes to the understanding of the PGPR inoculation in salinity stress. Additionally, it provides the layout of the understanding of the molecular interactions between RAB and GTP ligand.
25209982	Rice GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE is required for drought tolerance and grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.	2014	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is the primary food source for more than one-half of the world's population. Because rice cultivation is dependent on water availability, drought during flowering severely affects grain yield. Here, we show that the function of a drought-inducible receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, named GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE (GUDK), is required for grain yield under drought and well-watered conditions. Loss-of-function gudk mutant lines exhibit sensitivity to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment at the seedling stage, and a reduction in photosynthesis and plant biomass under controlled drought stress at the vegetative stage. The gudk mutants interestingly showed a significant reduction in grain yield, both under normal well-watered conditions and under drought stress at the reproductive stage. Phosphoproteome profiling of the mutant followed by in vitro assays identified the transcription factor APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR OsAP37 as a phosphorylation target of GUDK. The involvement of OsAP37 in regulating grain yield under drought through activation of several stress genes was previously shown. Our transactivation assays confirmed that GUDK is required for activation of stress genes by OsAP37. We propose that GUDK mediates drought stress signaling through phosphorylation and activation of OsAP37, resulting in transcriptional activation of stress-regulated genes, which impart tolerance and improve yield under drought. Our study reveals insights around drought stress signaling mediated by receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, and also identifies a primary regulator of grain yield in rice that offers the opportunity to improve and stabilize rice grain yield under normal and drought stress conditions.
25203424	STV11 encodes a sulphotransferase and confers durable resistance to rice stripe virus.	2014	Nat Commun	Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes one of the most serious viral diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.), but the molecular basis of RSV resistance has remained elusive. Here we show that the resistant allele of rice STV11 (STV11-R) encodes a sulfotransferase (OsSOT1) catalysing the conversion of salicylic acid (SA) into sulphonated SA (SSA), whereas the gene product encoded by the susceptible allele STV11-S loses this activity. Sequence analyses suggest that the STV11-R and STV11-S alleles were predifferentiated in different geographic populations of wild rice, Oryza rufipogon, and remained prevalent in cultivated indica and japonica rice varieties, respectively. Introgression of the STV11-R allele into susceptible cultivars or heterologous transfer of STV11-R into tobacco plants confers effective resistance against RSV. Our results shed new insights into plant viral defense mechanisms and suggest effective means of breeding RSV-resistant crops using molecular marker-assisted selection or genetic engineering.
25189534	Duplicate and conquer: multiple homologs of PHOSPHORUS-STARVATION TOLERANCE1 enhance phosphorus acquisition and sorghum performance on low-phosphorus soils.	2014	Plant Physiol	Low soil phosphorus (P) availability is a major constraint for crop production in tropical regions. The rice (Oryza sativa) protein kinase, PHOSPHORUS-STARVATION TOLERANCE1 (OsPSTOL1), was previously shown to enhance P acquisition and grain yield in rice under P deficiency. We investigated the role of homologs of OsPSTOL1 in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) performance under low P. Association mapping was undertaken in two sorghum association panels phenotyped for P uptake, root system morphology and architecture in hydroponics and grain yield and biomass accumulation under low-P conditions, in Brazil and/or in Mali. Root length and root surface area were positively correlated with grain yield under low P in the soil, emphasizing the importance of P acquisition efficiency in sorghum adaptation to low-P availability. SbPSTOL1 alleles reducing root diameter were associated with enhanced P uptake under low P in hydroponics, whereas Sb03g006765 and Sb03g0031680 alleles increasing root surface area also increased grain yield in a low-P soil. SbPSTOL1 genes colocalized with quantitative trait loci for traits underlying root morphology and dry weight accumulation under low P via linkage mapping. Consistent allelic effects for enhanced sorghum performance under low P between association panels, including enhanced grain yield under low P in the soil in Brazil, point toward a relatively stable role for Sb03g006765 across genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. This study indicates that multiple SbPSTOL1 genes have a more general role in the root system, not only enhancing root morphology traits but also changing root system architecture, which leads to grain yield gain under low-P availability in the soil.
25236969	An anther development F-box (ADF) protein regulated by tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) controls rice anther development.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: In this study, we reported that a F-box protein, OsADF, as one of the direct targets of TDR , plays a critical role in rice tapetum cell development and pollen formation. The tapetum, the innermost sporophytic tissue of anther, plays an important supportive role in male reproduction in flowering plants. After meiosis, tapetal cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and provide nutrients for pollen development. Previously we showed that tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, can trigger tapetal PCD and control pollen wall development during anther development. However, the comprehensive regulatory network of TDR remains to be investigated. In this study, we cloned and characterized a panicle-specific expression F-box protein, anther development F-box (OsADF). By qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, we further confirmed that OsADF expressed specially in tapetal cells from stage 9 to stage 12 during anther development. In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter. Therefore, this work highlighted the possible regulatory role of TDR, which regulates tapetal cell development and pollen formation via triggering the possible ADF-mediated proteolysis pathway.
25371548	Brassinosteroid regulates cell elongation by modulating gibberellin metabolism in rice.	2014	Plant Cell	Brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA) are two predominant hormones regulating plant cell elongation. A defect in either of these leads to reduced plant growth and dwarfism. However, their relationship remains unknown in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we demonstrated that BR regulates cell elongation by modulating GA metabolism in rice. Under physiological conditions, BR promotes GA accumulation by regulating the expression of GA metabolic genes to stimulate cell elongation. BR greatly induces the expression of D18/GA3ox-2, one of the GA biosynthetic genes, leading to increased GA1 levels, the bioactive GA in rice seedlings. Consequently, both d18 and loss-of-function GA-signaling mutants have decreased BR sensitivity. When excessive active BR is applied, the hormone mostly induces GA inactivation through upregulation of the GA inactivation gene GA2ox-3 and also represses BR biosynthesis, resulting in decreased hormone levels and growth inhibition. As a feedback mechanism, GA extensively inhibits BR biosynthesis and the BR response. GA treatment decreases the enlarged leaf angles in plants with enhanced BR biosynthesis or signaling. Our results revealed a previously unknown mechanism underlying BR and GA crosstalk depending on tissues and hormone levels, which greatly advances our understanding of hormone actions in crop plants and appears much different from that in Arabidopsis thaliana.
24211387	Restriction enzyme cutting site distribution regularity for DNA looping technology.	2014	Gene	The restriction enzyme cutting site distribution regularity and looping conditions were studied systematically. We obtained the restriction enzyme cutting site distributions of 13 commonly used restriction enzymes in 5 model organism genomes through two novel self-compiled software programs. All of the average distances between two adjacent restriction sites fell sharply with increasing statistic intervals, and most fragments were 0-499 bp. A shorter DNA fragment resulted in a lower looping rate, which was also directly proportional to the DNA concentration. When the length was more than 500 bp, the concentration did not affect the looping rate. Therefore, the best known fragment length was longer than 500 bp, and did not contain the restriction enzyme cutting sites which would be used for digestion. In order to make the looping efficiencies reach nearly 100%, 4-5 single cohesive end systems were recommended to digest the genome separately.
24569770	SnRK1A-interacting negative regulators modulate the nutrient starvation signaling sensor SnRK1 in source-sink communication in cereal seedlings under abiotic stress.	2014	Plant Cell	In plants, source-sink communication plays a pivotal role in crop productivity, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. The SnRK1A protein kinase and transcription factor MYBS1 regulate the sugar starvation signaling pathway during seedling growth in cereals. Here, we identified plant-specific SnRK1A-interacting negative regulators (SKINs). SKINs antagonize the function of SnRK1A, and the highly conserved GKSKSF domain is essential for SKINs to function as repressors. Overexpression of SKINs inhibits the expression of MYBS1 and hydrolases essential for mobilization of nutrient reserves in the endosperm, leading to inhibition of seedling growth. The expression of SKINs is highly inducible by drought and moderately by various stresses, which is likely related to the abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated repression of SnRK1A under stress. Overexpression of SKINs enhances ABA sensitivity for inhibition of seedling growth. ABA promotes the interaction between SnRK1A and SKINs and shifts the localization of SKINs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it binds SnRK1A and prevents SnRK1A and MYBS1 from entering the nucleus. Our findings demonstrate that SnRK1A plays a key role regulating source-sink communication during seedling growth. Under abiotic stress, SKINs antagonize the function of SnRK1A, which is likely a key factor restricting seedling vigor.
24388908	Cadmium accumulation, sub-cellular distribution and chemical forms in rice seedling in the presence of sulfur.	2014	Environ Toxicol Pharmacol	Changes in cadmium (Cd) accumulation, distribution, and chemical form in rice seedling in the joint presence of different concentrations of sulfur (S) remain almost unknown. Therefore, the indoor experiments were performed to determine the accumulation, sub-cellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd under three S levels in rice seedling for the first time. The result showed that Cd accumulation in rice roots was more than in shoots. Sub-cellular distribution of Cd in rice roots and shoots indicated that the largest proportion of Cd accumulated in cell walls and soluble fractions. As S supply increased, the proportion of Cd in cell walls reduced, while it increased in the soluble fractions. The majority of Cd existed in inorganic form, and then gradually changed to organic forms that included pectates and proteins with increased S supply. The results showed that S supply significantly influenced Cd accumulation, distribution, and chemical forms, suggesting that S might provide the material for the synthesis of sulfhydryl protein and thereby affect Cd stress on plants. These observations provided a basic understanding of potential ecotoxicological effects of joint Cd and S exposure in the environment.
24741364	Rice photosynthetic productivity and PSII photochemistry under nonflooded irrigation.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	Nonflooded irrigation is an important water-saving rice cultivation technology, but little is known on its photosynthetic mechanism. The aims of this work were to investigate photosynthetic characteristics of rice during grain filling stage under three nonflooded irrigation treatments: furrow irrigation with plastic mulching (FIM), furrow irrigation with nonmulching (FIN), and drip irrigation with plastic mulching (DI). Compared with the conventional flooding (CF) treatment, those grown in the nonflooded irrigation treatments showed lower net photosynthetic rate (PN), lower maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), and lower effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII). And the poor photosynthetic characteristics in the nonflooded irrigation treatments were mainly attributed to the low total nitrogen content (TNC). Under non-flooded irrigation, the PN, Fv/Fm, and ΦPSII significantly decreased with a reduction in the soil water potential, but these parameters were rapidly recovered in the DI and FIM treatments when supplementary irrigation was applied. Moreover, The DI treatment always had higher photosynthetic productivity than the FIM and FIN treatments. Grain yield, matter translocation, and dry matter post-anthesis (DMPA) were the highest in the CF treatment, followed by the DI, FIM, and FIN treatments in turn. In conclusion, increasing nitrogen content in leaf of rice plants could be a key factor to improve photosynthetic capacity in nonflooded irrigation.
25195461	Creation of Bt rice expressing a fusion protein of Cry1Ac and Cry1I-like using a green tissue-specific promoter.	2014	J Econ Entomol	The insecticidal genes from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) have long been successfully used for development of insect-resistant rice. However, commercial planting of Bt rice has been delayed by the concern over food safety, although no scientific evidence is ever found to justify the concern. To address this safety concern, we developed a transgenic insect-resistant rice line using a green tissue promoter to minimize the Bt protein expression in the rice seeds. The Bt protein expressed in the rice was a fusion protein of two different Bt toxins, Cry1Ac and Cry1I-like protein. The fusion of the two toxins may be helpful to delay the development of insect resistance to Bt rice. Laboratory and field bioassays demonstrated that the transgenic rice plants created by this study were highly active against the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) and the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker). Western analysis indicated that the fusion protein was specifically expressed in green tissues but not in seeds. Therefore, the transgenic rice created in this study should be useful to mitigate the food safety concern and to delay the development of insect resistance.
24737465	Cloning and expression analysis of the Lonicera japonica Thunb. chlorogenic acid synthetase gene (LjCCoAOMT1) in rice.	2014	Genet Mol Res	Complete coding DNA sequences of a closely related chlorogenic acid synthetase gene (LjCCoAOMT1) were isolated from Lonicera japonica Thunb. by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). LjCCoAOMT1 was subsequently overexpressed in Escherichia coli and a 25-kD protein was detected by electrophoresis and western blot analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that recombinant LjCCoAOMT1 methylates the caffeic acid substrate to generate ferulic acid. Further analysis showed that the chlorogenic acid content was significantly correlated with the expression level of LjCCoAOMT1 in various tissues of L. japonica Thunb. at different developmental stages. A plant expression vector containing LjCCoAOMT1 was constructed and Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic rice was successfully obtained. Light treatment analysis showed that LjCCoAOMT1 transgenic rice was more sensitive than wild-type rice in responding to the changes in lighting conditions. Although gibberellic acid (GA3) could promote the growth of both wild-type and LjCCoAOMT1 transgenic rice, LjCCoAOMT1 transgenic rice appeared to be more sensitive to GA3. Furthermore, high concentrations of GA3 significantly facilitated the growth of LjCCoAOMT1 transgenic rice.
24200857	Long-term toxicity study on transgenic rice with Cry1Ac and sck genes.	2014	Food Chem Toxicol	In the present work, we evaluated the chronic effects of the transgenic insect-resistant rice carrying Cry1Ac and sck genes on Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats through a 78-week feeding study. Based on the gender and weight, 180 SD rats were randomly and evenly assigned into three groups. GM rice and non-GM rice were separately formulated into diets at high levels. AIN-93 diet was used as a nutritional control. Body weight, food consumption, hematology and serum chemistry were monitored regularly. Rats were sacrificed for organ weight measurement and pathological examination at 52 weeks and 78 weeks. Body weight, food consumption, mortality rates, tumor incidences and pathological findings showed no significant difference among the three groups. Although certain differences in some hematology, serum chemistry parameters and relative organ weights were observed between GM rice group and control groups, they were not considered as treatment-related. Taken together, long-term intake of transgenic rice carrying Cry1Ac and sck genes at a high level exerts no unintended adverse effects on rats.
24390331	Rice stripe tenuivirus NSvc2 glycoproteins targeted to the golgi body by the N-terminal transmembrane domain and adjacent cytosolic 24 amino acids via the COP I- and COP II-dependent secretion pathway.	2014	J Virol	UNLABELLED: The NSvc2 glycoproteins encoded by Rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV) share many characteristics common to the glycoproteins found among Bunyaviridae. Within this viral family, glycoproteins targeting to the Golgi apparatus play a pivotal role in the maturation of the enveloped spherical particles. RSV particles, however, adopt a long filamentous morphology. Recently, RSV NSvc2 glycoproteins were shown to localize exclusively to the ER in Sf9 insect cells. Here, we demonstrate that the amino-terminal NSvc2 (NSvc2-N) targets to the Golgi apparatus in Nicotiana benthamiana cells, whereas the carboxyl-terminal NSvc2 (NSvc2-C) accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon coexpression, NSvc2-N redirects NSvc2-C from the ER to the Golgi bodies. The NSvc2 glycoproteins move together with the Golgi stacks along the ER/actin network. The targeting of the NSvc2 glycoproteins to the Golgi bodies was strictly dependent on functional anterograde traffic out of the ER to the Golgi bodies or on a retrograde transport route from the Golgi apparatus. The analysis of truncated and chimeric NSvc2 proteins demonstrates that the Golgi targeting signal comprises amino acids 269 to 315 of NSvc2-N, encompassing the transmembrane domain and 24 adjacent amino acids in the cytosolic tail. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the glycoproteins from an unenveloped Tenuivirus could target Golgi bodies in plant cells.

IMPORTANCE: NSvc2 glycoprotein encoded by unenveloped Rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV) share many characteristics in common with glycoprotein found among Bunyaviridae in which all members have membrane-enveloped sphere particle. Recently, RSV NSvc2 glycoproteins were shown to localize exclusively to the ER in Sf9 insect cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the RSV glycoproteins could target Golgi bodies in plant cells. The targeting of NSvc2 glycoproteins to the Golgi bodies was dependent on active COP II or COP I. The Golgi targeting signal was mapped to the 23-amino-acid transmembrane domain and the adjacent 24 amino acids of the cytosolic tail of the NSvc2-N. In light of the evidence from viruses in Bunyaviridae that targeting Golgi bodies is important for the viral particle assembly and vector transmission, we propose that targeting of RSV glycoproteins into Golgi bodies in plant cells represents a physiologically relevant mechanism in the maturation of RSV particle complex for insect vector transmission.
24472210	Impacts of Bt rice expressing Cry1C or Cry2A protein on the performance of nontarget leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), under laboratory and field conditions.	2014	Environ Entomol	Transgenic rice expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) protein can effectively control target insects including stem borers and leaf folders. However, the potential effects of Bt rice on nontarget organisms including nontarget herbivores have not been fully evaluated. In the current study, ecological fitness parameters of the nontarget herbivore, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), fed on T1C-19 (Cry1C) or T2A-1 (Cry2A) rice were compared with non-Bt rice (MH63) under laboratory conditions. A 2-yr field trial was also conducted to monitor the population dynamics of N. cincticeps in the Bt and control rice plots using the vacuum-suction machine and yellow sticky card traps. Laboratory results showed that there were no significant differences in some of biological parameters including egg developmental duration, adult fresh weight, adult longevity, and oviposition period when N. cincticeps fed on Bt or non-Bt rice was compared. However, the survival rate of N. cincticeps nymphs fed on T2A-1 Bt rice plants was significantly higher than that on the control. When N. cincticeps fed on T1C-19 Bt rice plants, its nymphal duration was significantly longer and fecundity significantly lower compared with those fed on both T2A-1 Bt and non-Bt rice plants; the preoviposition period of N. cincticeps fed on T1C-19 and T2A-1 Bt rice was also significantly shorter than those on non-Bt rice. Nonetheless, both seasonal density and population dynamics of N. cincticeps adults and nymphs were similar between Bt (T1C-19 and T2A-1) and non-Bt rice plots under field conditions. In conclusion, our results indicate that our two tested Bt rice lines would not lead to higher population of N. cincticeps. Long-term experiments to monitor the population dynamics of N. cincticeps at large scale need to be carried out to confirm the current results.
25192280	Rice ORMDL controls sphingolipid homeostasis affecting fertility resulting from abnormal pollen development.	2014	PLoS One	The orosomucoids (ORM) are ER-resisdent polypeptides encoded by ORM and ORMDL (ORM-like) genes. In humans, ORMDL3 was reported as genetic risk factor associated to asthma. In yeast, ORM proteins act as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis. Sphingolipids are important molecules regulating several processes including stress responses and apoptosis. However, the function of ORM/ORMDL genes in plants has not yet been reported. Previously, we found that temperature sensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS) rice lines controlled by tms2 contain a deletion of about 70 kb in chromosome 7. We identified four genes expressed in panicles, including an ORMDL ortholog, as candidates for tms2. In this report, we quantified expression of the only two candidate genes normally expressed in anthers of wild type plants grown in controlled growth rooms for fertile and sterile conditions. We found that only the ORMDL gene (LOC_Os07g26940) showed differential expression under these conditions. To better understand the function of rice ORMDL genes, we generated RNAi transgenic rice plants suppressing either LOC_Os07g26940, or all three ORMDL genes present in rice. We found that the RNAi transgenic plants with low expression of either LOC_Os07g26940 alone or all three ORMDL genes were sterile, having abnormal pollen morphology and staining. In addition, we found that both sphingolipid metabolism and expression of genes involved in sphingolipid synthesis were perturbed in the tms2 mutant, analogous to the role of ORMs in yeast. Our results indicated that plant ORMDL proteins influence sphingolipid homeostasis, and deletion of this gene affected fertility resulting from abnormal pollen development.
25239516	Domain analysis of 3 Keto Acyl-CoA synthase for structural variations in Vitis vinifera and Oryza brachyantha using comparative modelling.	2015	Interdiscip Sci	The long chain fatty acids incorporated into plant lipids are derived from the iterative addition of C2 units which is provided by malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA after interactions with 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), found in several plants. This study provides functional characterization of three 3 ketoacyl CoA synthase like proteins in Vitis vinifera (one) and Oryza brachyantha (two proteins). Sequence analysis reveals that protein of Oryza brachyantha shows 96% similarity to a hypothetical protein in Sorghum bicolor; total 11 homologs were predicted in Sorghum bicolor. Conserved domain prediction confirm the presence of FAE1/Type III polyketide synthase-like protein, Thiolase-like, subgroup; Thiolase-like and 3-Oxoacyl-ACP synthase III, C-terminal and chalcone synthase like domain but very long chain 3-keto acyl CoA domain is absent. All three proteins were found to have Chalcone and stilbene synthases C terminal domain which is similar to domain of thiolase and β keto acyl synthase. Its N terminal domain is absent in J3M9Z7 protein of Oryza brachyantha and F6HH63 protein of Vitis vinifera. Differences in N-terminal domain is responsible for distinguish activity. The J3MF16 protein of Oryza brachyantha contains N terminal domain and C terminal domain and characterized using annotation of these domains. Domains Gcs (streptomyces coelicolor) and Chalcone-stilbene synthases (KAS) in 2-pyrone synthase (Gerbera hybrid) and chalcone synthase 2 (Medicago sativa) were found to be present in three proteins. This similarity points toward anthocyanin biosynthetic process. Similarity to chalcone synthase 2 reveals its possible role in Naringenine and Chalcone synthase like activity. In 3 keto acyl CoA synthase of Oryza brachyantha. Active site residues C-240, H-407, N-447 are present in J3MF16 protein that are common in these three protein at different positions. Structural variations among dimer interface, product binding site, malonyl-CoA binding sites, were predicted in localized combination of conserved residues.
25208476	RNase Z(S1) processes UbL40 mRNAs and controls thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	Thermosensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) lines, which are male-sterile at restrictive (high) temperatures but male-fertile at permissive (low) temperatures, have been widely used in breeding two-line hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here we find that mutation of thermosensitive genic male sterile 5 (tms5) in rice causes the TGMS trait through a loss of RNase Z(S1) function. We show that RNase Z(S1) processes the mRNAs of three ubiquitin fusion ribosomal protein L40 (UbL40) genes into multiple fragments in vitro and in vivo. In tms5 mutants, high temperature results in increased levels of UbL40 mRNAs. Overaccumulation of UbL40 mRNAs causes defective pollen production and male sterility. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of RNase Z(S1)-mediated UbL40 mRNA regulation and shows that loss of this regulation produces TGMS in rice, a finding with potential applications in hybrid crop breeding.
25198435	Toward understanding of rice innate immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2016	Crit Rev Biotechnol	The blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, causes serious disease on a wide variety of grasses including rice, wheat and barley. The recognition of pathogens is an amazing ability of plants including strategies for displacing virulence effectors through the adaption of both conserved and variable pathogen elicitors. The pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) were reported as two main innate immune responses in plants, where PTI gives basal resistance and ETI confers durable resistance. The PTI consists of extracellular surface receptors that are able to recognize PAMPs. PAMPs detect microbial features such as fungal chitin that complete a vital function during the organism's life. In contrast, ETI is mediated by intracellular receptor molecules containing nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains that specifically recognize effector proteins produced by the pathogen. To enhance crop resistance, understanding the host resistance mechanisms against pathogen infection strategies and having a deeper knowledge of innate immunity system are essential. This review summarizes the recent advances on the molecular mechanism of innate immunity systems of rice against M. oryzae. The discussion will be centered on the latest success reported in plant-pathogen interactions and integrated defense responses in rice.
25246444	The SWEET family of sugar transporters in grapevine: VvSWEET4 is involved in the interaction with Botrytis cinerea.	2014	J Exp Bot	During plant development, sugar export is determinant in multiple processes such as nectar production, pollen development and long-distance sucrose transport. The plant SWEET family of sugar transporters is a recently identified protein family of sugar uniporters. In rice, SWEET transporters are the target of extracellular bacteria, which have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to modify their expression and acquire sugars to sustain their growth. Here we report the characterization of the SWEET family of sugar transporters in Vitis vinifera. We identified 17 SWEET genes in the V. vinifera 40024 genome and show that they are differentially expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs. Inoculation with the biotrophic pathogens Erysiphe necator and Plasmopara viticola did not result in significant induction of VvSWEET gene expression. However, infection with the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea triggered a strong up-regulation of VvSWEET4 expression. Further characterization of VvSWEET4 revealed that it is a glucose transporter localized in the plasma membrane that is up-regulated by inducers of reactive oxygen species and virulence factors from necrotizing pathogens. Finally, Arabidopsis knockout mutants in the orthologous AtSWEET4 were found to be less susceptible to B. cinerea. We propose that stimulation of expression of a developmentally regulated glucose uniporter by reactive oxygen species production and extensive cell death after necrotrophic fungal infection could facilitate sugar acquisition from plant cells by the pathogen.
25245166	Genome-wide analysis of the GRAS gene family in Prunus mume.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Prunus mume is an ornamental flower and fruit tree in Rosaceae. We investigated the GRAS gene family to improve the breeding and cultivation of P. mume and other Rosaceae fruit trees. The GRAS gene family encodes transcriptional regulators that have diverse functions in plant growth and development, such as gibberellin and phytochrome A signal transduction, root radial patterning, and axillary meristem formation and gametogenesis in the P. mume genome. Despite the important roles of these genes in plant growth regulation, no findings on the GRAS genes of P. mume have been reported. In this study, we discerned phylogenetic relationships of P. mume GRAS genes, and their locations, structures in the genome and expression levels of different tissues. Out of 46 identified GRAS genes, 45 were located on the 8 P. mume chromosomes. Phylogenetic results showed that these genes could be classified into 11 groups. We found that Group X was P. mume-specific, and three genes of Group IX clustered with the rice-specific gene Os4. We speculated that these genes existed before the divergence of dicotyledons and monocotyledons and were lost in Arabidopsis. Tissue expression analysis indicated that 13 genes showed high expression levels in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, and were related to plant growth and development. Functional analysis of 24 GRAS genes and an orthologous relationship analysis indicated that many functioned during plant growth and flower and fruit development. Our bioinformatics analysis provides valuable information to improve the economic, agronomic and ecological benefits of P. mume and other Rosaceae fruit trees.
25273891	Copper suppresses abscisic acid catabolism and catalase activity, and inhibits seed germination of rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Although copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plants, a slight excess of Cu in soil can be harmful to plants. Unfortunately, Cu contamination is a growing problem all over the world due to human activities, and poses a soil stress to plant development. As one of the most important biological processes, seed germination is sensitive to Cu stress. However, little is known about the mechanism of Cu-induced inhibition of seed germination. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between Cu and ABA which is the predominant regulator of seed germination. Cu at a concentration of 30 µM effectively inhibited germination of rice caryopsis. ABA content in germinating seeds under copper stress was also higher than that under control conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that Cu treatment reduced the expression of OsABA8ox2, a key gene of ABA catabolism in rice seeds. In addition, both malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 contents were increased by Cu stress in the germinating seeds. Antioxidant enzyme assays revealed that only catalase activity was reduced by excess Cu, which was consistent with the mRNA profile of OsCATa during seed germination under Cu stress. Together, our results demonstrate that suppression of ABA catabolism and catalase (CAT) activity by excess Cu leads to the inhibition of seed germination of rice.
25208645	A down-regulated epi-allele of the genomes uncoupled 4 gene generates a xantha marker trait in rice.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A γ-ray-induced xantha trait is epigenetically controlled by the genomes uncoupled 4 gene with enhanced promoter segment methylation and down-regulated expression in rice. For easy testing and to increase varietal purity, a xantha mutation (xnt), which turns plants yellow and makes them visually distinguishable from normal green rice, has been generated and bred into male sterile lines for hybrid rice production. The xnt locus was previously fine mapped to a ~100-kb interval on chromosome 11, but its identity was unknown. In this study, xnt was further narrowed down to a 57-kb fragment carrying eight opening reading frames (ORFs). All eight ORFs had identical genomic sequences and all but ORF2 (g enomes uncoupled 4, OsGUN4) had similar transcript abundance in the xantha mutant Huangyu B (HYB) and its parental variety Longtefu B (LTB). The expression of OsGUN4, however, was significantly reduced in HYB compared with LTB in terms of both transcript abundance (0.2% that of LTB) and expressed protein level (barely detectable in HYB but greater than the heat shock protein reference in LTB). Therefore, OsGUN4 was identified as the candidate gene underlying the xantha trait. The function of OsGUN4 in the xantha phenotype was confirmed by identification and characterization of new allelic OsGUN4 mutations. Comparative bisulfite genomic sequencing of OsGUN4 revealed increased methylation in a promoter region in the mutant, and the correlation between increased methylation and the xantha phenotype was further verified by demethylation treatment. In summary, we have identified an epi-allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter down-regulated its expression in rice.
25046435	Contribution of cationic amino acids toward the inhibition of Arg-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain) by the antimicrobial dodecapeptide, CL(14-25), from rice protein.	2014	Biopolymers	CL(14-25), a dodecapeptide, exhibits antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis with the 50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) value of 145 µM, and arginine-specific gingipain (Rgp)-inhibitory activity. Kinetic analysis revealed that CL(14-25) is a mixed-type inhibitor, with inhibition constants (Ki and Ki ' values) of 1.4 × 10(-6) M and 4.3 × 10(-6) M, respectively. To elucidate the contributions of four cationic amino acid residues at the N- and C-termini of CL(14-25) toward Rgp-inhibitory activity, we investigated the Rgp-inhibitory activities of truncated and alanine-substituted analogs of CL(14-25). Rgp-inhibitory activities significantly decreased by truncated analogs, CL(15-25) and CL(16-25), whereas those of CL(14-24) and CL(14-23) were almost as high as that of CL(14-25). Rgp-inhibitory activities of alanine-substituted analogs, CL(R14A) and CL(R14A, R15A) also significantly decreased, whereas those of CL(K25A) and CL(R24A, K25A) were higher than that of CL(14-25). These results suggest that the arginine residue at position 15 substantially contributes to the Rgp-inhibitory activity and that the arginine residue at position 14 plays important roles in exerting Rgp-inhibitory activity. In this study, we demonstrated that CL(K25A) was a potent, dual function, peptide inhibitor candidate, exhibiting Rgp-inhibitory activity with Ki and Ki ' of 9.6 × 10(-7) M and 1.9 × 10(-6) M, respectively, and antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis with an IC50 value of 51 µM.
25221924	Evaluation of the anti-nitrative effect of plant antioxidants using a cowpea Fe-superoxide dismutase as a target.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Nitric oxide cytotoxicity arises from its rapid conversion to peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in the presence of superoxide, provoking functional changes in proteins by nitration of tyrosine residues. The physiological significance of this post-translational modification is associated to tissue injury in animals, but has not been yet clarified in plants. The objective of this study was to establish new approaches that could help to understand ONOO(-) reactivity in plants. A recombinant Fe-superoxide dismutase from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), rVuFeSOD, was the target of the ONOO(-)-generator SIN-1, and the anti-nitrative effect of plant antioxidants and haemoglobins was tested in vitro. Nitration on rVuFeSOD was evaluated immunochemically or as the loss of its enzymatic activity. This assay proved to be useful to test a variety of plant compounds for anti-nitrative capacity. Experimental data confirmed that rice (Oryza sativa L.) haemoglobin-1 (rOsHbI) and cowpea leghaemoglobin-2 exerted a protective function against ONOO(-) by diminishing nitration on rVuFeSOD. Both plant haemoglobins were nitrated by SIN-1. The chelator desferrioxamine suppressed nitration in rOsHbI, indicating that Fe plays a key role in the reaction. The removal of the haem moiety in rOsHbI importantly suppressed nitration, evidencing that this reaction may be self-catalyzed. Among small antioxidants, ascorbate remarkably decreased nitration in all tests. The phenolic compounds caffeic acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and the flavonoid gossypin also diminished tyrosine nitration and protected rVuFeSOD to different extents. It is concluded that small plant antioxidants, especially ascorbate, and haemoglobins may well play key roles in ONOO(-) homeostasis in vivo.
25320558	QTL analysis on rice grain appearance quality, as exemplifying the typical events of transgenic or backcrossing breeding.	2014	Breed Sci	Rice grain shape and yield are usually controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL). This study used a set of F9-10 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of Huahui 3 (Bt/Xa21) and Zhongguoxiangdao, and detected 27 QTLs on ten rice chromosomes. Among them, twelve QTLs responsive for grain shape/ or yield were mostly reproducibly detected and had not yet been reported before. Interestingly, the two known genes involved in the materials, with one insect-resistant Bt gene, and the other disease-resistant Xa21 gene, were found to closely link the QTLs responsive for grain shape and weight. The Bt fragment insertion was firstly mapped on the chromosome 10 in Huahui 3 and may disrupt grain-related QTLs resulting in weaker yield performance in transgenic plants. The introgression of Xa21 gene by backcrossing from donor material into receptor Minghui 63 may also contain a donor linkage drag which included minor-effect QTL alleles positively affecting grain shape and yield. The QTL analysis on rice grain appearance quality exemplified the typical events of transgenic or backcrossing breeding. The QTL findings in this study will in the future facilitate the gene isolation and breeding application for improvement of rice grain shape and yield.
25284193	Precision genome editing in plants via gene targeting and piggyBac-mediated marker excision.	2015	Plant J	Precise genome engineering via homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene targeting (GT) has become an essential tool in molecular breeding as well as in basic plant science. As HR-mediated GT is an extremely rare event, positive-negative selection has been used extensively in flowering plants to isolate cells in which GT has occurred. In order to utilize GT as a methodology for precision mutagenesis, the positive selectable marker gene should be completely eliminated from the GT locus. Here, we introduce targeted point mutations conferring resistance to herbicide into the rice acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene via GT with subsequent marker excision by piggyBac transposition. Almost all regenerated plants expressing piggyBac transposase contained exclusively targeted point mutations without concomitant re-integration of the transposon, resulting in these progeny showing a herbicide bispyribac sodium (BS)-tolerant phenotype. This approach was also applied successfully to the editing of a microRNA targeting site in the rice cleistogamy 1 gene. Therefore, our approach provides a general strategy for the targeted modification of endogenous genes in plants.
25345491	The miR156-SPL9-DFR pathway coordinates the relationship between development and abiotic stress tolerance in plants.	2014	Plant J	Young organisms have relatively strong resistance to diseases and adverse conditions. When confronted with adversity, the process of development is delayed in plants. This phenomenon is thought to result from the rebalancing of energy, which helps plants to coordinate the relationship between development and stress tolerance; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains mysterious. In this study, we found that miR156 integrates environmental signals to ensure timely flowering, thus enabling the completion of breeding. Under stress conditions, miR156 is induced to maintain the plant in the juvenile state for a relatively long period of time, whereas under favorable conditions, miR156 is suppressed to accelerate the developmental transition. Blocking the miR156 signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana with 35S::MIM156 (via target mimicry) increased the sensitivity of the plant to stress treatment, whereas overexpression of miR156 increased stress tolerance. In fact, this mechanism is also conserved in Oryza sativa (rice). We also identified downstream genes of miR156, i.e. SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9 (SPL9) and DIHYDROFLAVONOL-4-REDUCTASE (DFR), which take part in this process by influencing the metabolism of anthocyanin. Our results uncover a molecular mechanism for plant adaptation to the environment through the miR156-SPLs-DFR pathway, which coordinates development and abiotic stress tolerance.
25336336	Differences in responses to flooding by germinating seeds of two contrasting rice cultivars and two species of economically important grass weeds.	2014	AoB Plants	Crop productivity is largely affected by abiotic factors such as flooding and by biotic factors such as weeds. Although flooding after direct seeding of rice helps suppress weeds, it also can adversely affects germination and growth of rice, resulting in poor crop establishment. Barnyard grasses (Echinochloa spp.) are among the most widespread weeds affecting rice, especially under direct seeding. The present work aimed to establish effective management options to control these weeds. We assessed the effects of variable depths and time of submergence on germination, seedling growth and carbohydrate metabolism of (i) two cultivars of rice known to differ in their tolerance to flooding during germination and (ii) two barnyard grasses (Echinochloa colona and E. crus-galli) that commonly infest rice fields. Flooding barnyard grasses with 100-mm-deep water immediately after seeding was effective in suppressing germination and growth. Echinochloa colona showed greater reductions in emergence, shoot and root growth than E. crus-galli. Delaying flooding for 2 or 4 days was less injurious to both species. Echinochloa colona was also more susceptible to flooding than the flood-sensitive rice cultivar 'IR42'. The activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) in rice seedlings was increased by flooding after sowing but with greater increases in 'Khao Hlan On' compared with 'IR42'. The activity of ADH and PDC was enhanced to a similar extent in both barnyard grasses. Under aerobic conditions, the activity of ADH and PDC in the two barnyard grasses was downregulated, which might contribute to their inherently faster growth compared with rice. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was significantly enhanced in flood-tolerant 'Khao Hlan On' and E. crus-galli, but did not increase in flood-sensitive E. colona and 'IR42', implying a greater ability of the flood-tolerant types to detoxify acetaldehyde generated during anaerobic fermentation. Confirmation of this hypothesis is now being sought.
25311582	MYB80 homologues in Arabidopsis, cotton and Brassica: regulation and functional conservation in tapetal and pollen development.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Arabidopsis AtMYB80 transcription factor regulates genes involved in pollen development and controls the timing of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD). Downregulation of AtMYB80 expression precedes tapetal degradation. Inhibition of AtMYB80 expression results in complete male sterility. Full-length AtMYB80 homologs have been isolated in wheat, rice, barley and canola (C genome).

RESULTS: The complete sequences of MYB80 genes from the Brassica. napus (A gene), B. juncea (A gene), B. oleracea (C gene) and the two orthologs from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were determined. The deduced amino acid sequences possess a highly conserved MYB domain, 44-amino acid region and 18-amino acid C-terminal sequence. The cotton MYB80 protein can fully restore fertility of the atmyb80 mutant, while removal of the 44 amino acid sequence abolishes its function. Two conserved MYB cis-elements in the AtMYB80 promoter are required for downregulation of MYB80 expression in anthers, apparently via negative auto-regulation. In cotton, tapetal degradation occurs at a slightly earlier stage of anther development than in Arabidopsis, consistent with an earlier increase and subsequent downregulation in GhMYB80 expression. The MYB80 homologs fused with the EAR repressor motif have been shown to induce male sterility in Arabidopsis. Constructs were designed to maximize the level of male sterility.

CONCLUSIONS: MYB80 genes are conserved in structure and function in all monocot and dicot species so far examined. Expression patterns of MYB80 in these species are also highly similar. The reversible male sterility system developed in Arabidopsis by manipulating MYB80 expression should be applicable to all major crops.
25284137	Comparison of three transgenic Bt rice lines for insecticidal protein expression and resistance against a target pest, Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae).	2016	Insect Sci	Two transgenic rice lines (T2A-1 and T1C-19b) expressing cry2A and cry1C genes, respectively, were developed in China, targeting lepidopteran pests including Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The seasonal expression of Cry proteins in different tissues of the rice lines and their resistance to C. suppressalis were assessed in comparison to a Bt rice line expressing a cry1Ab/Ac fusion gene, Huahui 1, which has been granted a biosafety certificate. In general, levels of Cry proteins were T2A-1 > Huahui 1 > T1C-19b among rice lines, and leaf > stem > root among rice tissues. The expression patterns of Cry protein in the rice line plants were similar: higher level at early stages than at later stages with an exception that high Cry1C level in T1C-19b stems at the maturing stage. The bioassay results revealed that the three transgenic rice lines exhibited significantly high resistance against C. suppressalis larvae throughout the rice growing season. According to Cry protein levels in rice tissues, the raw and corrected mortalities of C. suppressalis caused by each Bt rice line were the highest in the seedling and declined through the jointing stage with an exception for T1C-19b providing an excellent performance at the maturing stage. By comparison, T1C-19b exhibited more stable and greater resistance to C. suppressalis larvae than T2A-1, being close to Huahui 1. The results suggest cry1C is an ideal Bt gene for plant transformation for lepidopteran pest control, and T1C-19b is a promising Bt rice line for commercial use for tolerating lepidopteran rice pests.
25190075	Ameliorative effect of black rice anthocyanin on senescent mice induced by D-galactose.	2014	Food Funct	This study investigated the ameliorative effect of black rice anthocyanin (BACN) in senescent mice induced by D-galactose. The male mice were randomly divided into five groups, namely, the normal group, the model group and dosage groups (15, 30 and 60 mg kg(-1) of BACN). The model group and three dosage groups were continuously injected subcutaneously with D-galactose. The results suggested that superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly increased upon black rice anthocyanin treatment, while MDA and the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) significantly decreased. The expressions of superoxide dismutase genes (SOD1 and SOD2) in liver were up-regulated in black rice anthocyanin group, while the expression of the MAO-B gene was down-regulated. These findings demonstrated that the ameliorative effect of BACN might be achieved partly by altering endogenous antioxidant enzymatic and aging-related enzymatic activities and regulating SOD1, SOD2 and MAO-B gene expressions.
25344442	ABI-like transcription factor gene TaABL1 from wheat improves multiple abiotic stress tolerances in transgenic plants.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays crucial roles in adaptive responses of plants to abiotic stresses. ABA-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) are basic leucine zipper transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream genes containing ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in promoter regions. A novel ABI-like (ABA-insensitive) transcription factor gene, named TaABL1, containing a conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain was cloned from wheat. Southern blotting showed that three copies were present in the wheat genome. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that TaABL1 belonged to the AREB subfamily of the bZIP transcription factor family and was most closely related to ZmABI5 in maize and OsAREB2 in rice. Expression of TaABL1 was highly induced in wheat roots, stems, and leaves by ABA, drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses. TaABL1 was localized inside the nuclei of transformed wheat mesophyll protoplast. Overexpression of TaABL1 enhanced responses of transgenic plants to ABA and hastened stomatal closure under stress, thereby improving tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of TaABL1 upregulated or downregulated the expression of some stress-related genes controlling stomatal closure in transgenic plants under ABA and drought stress conditions, suggesting that TaABL1 might be a valuable genetic resource for transgenic molecular breeding.
25275554	Evaluation of the agronomic performance of atrazine-tolerant transgenic japonica rice parental lines for utilization in hybrid seed production.	2014	PLoS One	Currently, the purity of hybrid seed is a crucial limiting factor when developing hybrid japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.). To chemically control hybrid seed purity, we transferred an improved atrazine chlorohydrolase gene (atzA) from Pseudomonas ADP into hybrid japonica parental lines (two maintainers, one restorer), and Nipponbare, by using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We subsequently selected several transgenic lines from each genotype by using PCR, RT-PCR, and germination analysis. In the presence of the investigated atrazine concentrations, particularly 150 µM atrazine, almost all of the transgenic lines produced significantly larger seedlings, with similar or higher germination percentages, than did the respective controls. Although the seedlings of transgenic lines were taller and gained more root biomass compared to the respective control plants, their growth was nevertheless inhibited by atrazine treatment compared to that without treatment. When grown in soil containing 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg atrazine, the transgenic lines were taller, and had higher total chlorophyll contents than did the respective controls; moreover, three of the strongest transgenic lines completely recovered after 45 days of growth. After treatment with 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg of atrazine, the atrazine residue remaining in the soil was 2.9-7.0% or 0.8-8.7% respectively, for transgenic lines, and 44.0-59.2% or 28.1-30.8%, respectively, for control plants. Spraying plants at the vegetative growth stage with 0.15% atrazine effectively killed control plants, but not transgenic lines. Our results indicate that transgenic atzA rice plants show tolerance to atrazine, and may be used as parental lines in future hybrid seed production.
25392067	The matrix polysaccharide (1;3,1;4)-β-D-glucan is involved in silicon-dependent strengthening of rice cell wall.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Poales [represented by rice (Oryza sativa L.)] in angiosperms and Equisetum (horsetails) in Pteridophytes are two major groups of heavy silicon (Si) accumulators. In rice, Si is polymerized preferentially in the epidermal cell wall, forming Si-cuticle double layers and Si-cellulose double layers beneath the cuticle. This Si layer is thought to exert various beneficial effects on the growth and development of land plants. Although the recent discovery of the influx and efflux transporters of silicic acid has shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of Si uptake and transport in rice, the mechanism underlying the final incorporation of polymerized Si into the cell wall remains elusive. Despite their phylogenetic distance, the cell walls of the two Si accumulators, Poales and Equisetum, share another common component, i.e. (1;3,1;4)-β-D-glucan, also known as mixed-linkage glucan (MLG), a matrix polysaccharide not found in other plants. Based on this coincidence, a possible correlation between the functions of Si and MLG in the cell wall has been suggested, but no experimental evidence has been obtained in support of this functional correlation. Here, we present an analysis of the correlative action of Si and MLG on the mechanical properties of leaf blades using a transgenic rice line in which the MLG level was reduced by overexpressing EGL1, which encodes (1;3,1;4)-β-D-glucanase. The reduction in MLG did not affect total Si accumulation, but it significantly altered the Si distribution profile and reduced the Si-dependent mechanical properties of the leaf blades, strongly suggesting a functional correlation between Si and MLG.
25572223	Mapping and introgression of QTL for yield and related traits in two backcross populations derived from Oryza sativa cv. Swarna and two accessions of O. nivara.	2014	J Genet	Advanced backcross QTL (AB-QTL) analysis was carried out in two Oryza nivara-derived BC2F2 populations. For nine traits, we identified 28 QTL in population 1 and 26 QTL in population 2. The two most significant yield-enhancing QTL, yldp9.1 and yldp2.1 showed an additive effect of 16 and 7 g per plant in population 1, while yld2.1 and yld11.1 showed an additive effect of 11 and 10 g per plant in population 2. At least one O. nivara-derived QTL with a phenotypic variance of >15% was detected for seven traits in population 1 and three traits in population 2. The O. nivara-derived QTL ph1.1, nt12.1, nsp1.1, nfg1.1, bm11.1, yld2.1 and yld11.1 were conserved at the same chromosomal locations in both populations. Two major QTL clusters were detected at the marker intervals RM488-RM431 and RM6-RM535 on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. The colocation of O. nivara-derived yield QTL with yield meta-QTL on chromosomes 1, 2 and 9 indicates their accuracy and consistency. The major-effect QTL reported in this study are useful for marker-assisted breeding and are also suitable for further fine mapping and candidate gene identification.
25488347	High-throughput transformation pipeline for a Brazilian japonica rice with bar gene selection.	2015	Protoplasma	The goal of this work was to establish a transformation pipeline for upland Curinga rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) with bar gene selection employing bialaphos and phosphinothricin as selection agents. The following genes of interest: AtNCED3, Lsi1, GLU2, LEW2, PLD-alpha, DA1, TOR, AVP1, and Rubisco were cloned into the binary vector p7i2x-Ubi and were transferred into Agrobacterium strain EHA 105. Embryogenic calli derived from the mature embryos were transformed, and transgenic cells and shoots were selected on the medium supplemented with bialaphos or phosphinothricin (PPT) using a stepwise selection scheme. Molecular analyses were established using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot for the bar gene and the NOS terminator. Overall, 273 putative transgenic plants were analyzed by Southern blot with 134 events identified. In total, 77 events had a single copy of the transgene integrated in the plant genome while 29 events had two copies. We tested backbone integration in 101 transgenic plants from all constructs and found 60 transgenic plants having no additional sequence integrated in the plant genome. The bar gene activity was evaluated by the chlorophenol red test and the leaf painting test using phosphinothricin with several transgenic plants. The majority of T0 plants carrying the single copy of transgene produced T1 seeds in the screen house.
25481774	A vacuolar antiporter is differentially regulated in leaves and roots of the halophytic wild rice Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka.	2015	Mol Biol Rep	Vacuolar NHX-type antiporters play a role in Na(+)/K(+) uptake that contributes to growth, nutrition and development. Under salt/osmotic stress they mediate the vacuolar compartmentalization of K(+)/Na(+), thereby preventing toxic Na(+)K(+) ratios in the cytosol. Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, a mangrove associate, is a distant wild relative of cultivated rice and is saline as well as submergence tolerant. A vacuolar NHX homolog isolated from a P. coarctata cDNA library (PcNHX1) shows 96 % identity (nucleotide level) to OsNHX1. Diurnal PcNHX1 expression in leaves was found to be largely unaltered, though damped by salinity. PcNHX1 promoter directed GUS expression is phloem-specific in leaves, stem and roots of transgenic plants in the absence of stress. Under NaCl stress, GUS expression was also seen in the epidermal and sub-epidermal layers (mesophyll, guard cells and trichomes) of leaves, root tip. The salinity in the rhizosphere of P. coarctata varies considerably due to diurnal/semi-diurnal tidal inundation. The diurnal expression of PcNHX1 in leaves and salinity induced expression in roots may have evolved in response to dynamic changes in salinity of in the P. coarctata rhizosphere. Despite high sequence conservation between OsNHX1 and PcNHX1, the distinctive expression pattern of PcNHX1 exemplifies how variation in expression is fine tuned to suit the halophytic growth habitat of a plant.
25492221	Control of grain protein contents through SEMIDWARF1 mutant alleles: sd1 increases the grain protein content in Dee-geo-woo-gen but not in Reimei.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	A new possibility for genetic control of the protein content of rice grains was suggested by the allele differences of the SEMIDWARF1 (SD1) mutation. Two quantitative trait loci-qPROT1 and qPROT12-were found on chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively, using backcrossed inbred lines of Sasanishiki/Habataki//Sasanishiki///Sasanishiki. One of them, qPROT1, increased almost all grain proteins instead of only certain proteins in the recessive Habataki allele. Fine mapping of qPROT1 revealed that two gene candidates-Os01g0883800 and Os01g0883900-were included in this region. Os01g0883800 encoded Gibberellin 20 oxidase 2 as well as SD1, the dwarf gene used in the so-called 'Green Revolution'. Mutant analyses as well as sequencing analysis using the semi-dwarf mutant cultivars Dee-geo-woo-gen and Calrose 76 revealed that the sd1 mutant showed significantly higher grain protein contents than their corresponding wild-type cultivars, strongly suggesting that the high protein contents were caused by sd1 mutation. However, the sd1 mutant Reimei did not have high grain protein contents. It is possible to control the grain protein content and column length separately by selecting for sd1 alleles. From this finding, the genetic control of grain protein content, as well as the column length of rice cultivars, might be possible. This ability might be useful to improve rice nutrition, particularly in areas where the introduction of semi-dwarf cultivars is not advanced.
25491793	Genetic diversity analysis in a set of Caricaceae accessions using resistance gene analogues.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: In order to assess genetic diversity of a set of 41 Caricaceae accessions, this study used 34 primer pairs designed from the conserved domains of bacterial leaf blight resistance genes from rice, in a PCR based approach, to identify and analyse resistance gene analogues from various accessions of Carica papaya, Vasconcellea goudotiana, V. microcarpa, V. parviflora, V. pubescens, V. stipulata and, V. quercifolia and Jacaratia spinosa.

RESULTS: Of the 34 primer pairs fourteen gave amplification products. A total of 115 alleles were identified from 41 accesions along with 12 rare and 11 null alleles. The number of alleles per primer pair ranged from 4 to 10 with an average of 8.21 alleles/ primer pair. The average polymorphism information content value was 0.75/primer. The primers for the gene Xa1 did not give any amplification product. As a group, the Indian Carica papaya accessions produced a total of 102 alleles from 27 accessions. The similarity among the 41 accessions ranged from 1% to 53%. The dendrogram made from Jaccard's genetic similarity coefficient generated two major clusters showing that the alleles of Jacaratia spinosa and Vasconcellea accessions were distinctly different from those of Carica papaya accessions. All the alleles were sequenced and eleven of them were allotted accession numbers by NCBI. Homology searches identified similarity to rice BLB resistance genes and pseudogenes. Conserved domain searches identified gamma subunit of transcription initiation factor IIA (TFIIA), cytochrome P450, signaling domain of methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP), Nickel hydrogenase and leucine rich repeats (LRR) within the sequenced RGAs.

CONCLUSIONS: The RGA profiles produced by the 14 primer pairs generated high genetic diversity. The RGA profiles identified each of the 41 accessions clearly unequivocally. Most of the DNA sequences of the amplified RGAs from this set of 41 accessions showed significant homology to the conserved regions of rice bacterial leaf blight resistance genes. These information can be used in future for large scale investigation of tentative disease resistance genes of Carica papaya and other Caricaceae genus specially Vasconcellea. Inoculation studies will be necessary to link the identified sequences to disease resistance or susceptibility.
25443844	Enrichment and analysis of rice seedling ubiquitin-related proteins using four UBA domains (GST-qUBAs).	2014	Plant Sci	Protein ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that often occurs on lysine residues. It controls the half-life, interaction and trafficking of intracellular proteins and is involved in different plant development stages and responses to environment stresses. Four Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) domains were sequentially fused with Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag (GST-qUBA) as bait protein in this study. A two-step affinity protocol was successfully developed and the identification of ubiquitinated proteins and their interaction proteins increased almost threefold compared to methods that directly identify ubiquitinated proteins from crude samples. A total of 170 ubiquitin-related proteins were identified in GST-qUBAs enriched samples taken from rice seedlings. There were 134 ubiquitinated proteins, 5 ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), 5 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), 19 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and 7 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which all contained various key factors that regulated a wide range of biological processes. Moreover, a series of novel ubiquitinated proteins and E3s were identified that had not been previously reported. This study investigated a high-efficiency method for identifying novel ubiquitinated proteins involved in biological processes and a primary mapping of the ubiquitylome during rice seedling development, which could extend our understanding of how ubiquitin modification regulates plant proteins, pathways and cellular processes.
25572226	Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in rice.	2014	J Genet	Phosphate availability is a major factor limiting tillering, grain filling vis-á-vis productivity of rice. Rice is often cultivated in soil like red and lateritic or acid, with low soluble phosphate content. To identify the best genotype suitable for these types of soils, P acquisition efficiency was estimated from 108 genotypes. Gobindabhog, Tulaipanji, Radhunipagal and Raghusail accumulated almost equal amounts of phosphate even when they were grown on P-sufficient soil. Here, we have reported the presence as well as the expression of a previously characterized rice gene, phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in a set of selected genotypes. Two of four genotypes did not show any detectable expression but carried the gene. One mega cultivar, Swarna did not possess this gene but showed high P-deficiency tolerance ability. Increase of root biomass, not length, in P-limiting situations might be considered as one of the selecting criteria at the seedling stage. Neither the presence of PSTOL1 gene nor its closely-linked SSR RM1261, showed any association with P-deficiency tolerance among the 108 genotypes. Not only this, but the presence of PSTOL1 in recombinant inbred line (RIL) developed from a cross between Gobindabhog and Satabdi, also did not show any linkage with P-deficiency tolerance ability. Thus, before considering PSTOL1 gene in MAB, its expression and role in P-deficiency tolerance in the donor parent must be ascertained.
25492397	LOOSE FLOWER, a WUSCHEL-like Homeobox gene, is required for lateral fusion of floral organs in Medicago truncatula.	2015	Plant J	The Medicago truncatula WOX gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), and its orthologs in Petunia, pea, and Nicotiana sylvestris are required for leaf blade outgrowth and floral organ development as demonstrated by severe phenotypes in single mutants. But the Arabidopsis wox1 mutant displays a narrow leaf phenotype only when combined with the prs/wox3 mutant. In maize and rice, WOX3 homologs are major regulators of leaf blade development. Here we investigated the role of WOX3 in M. truncatula development by isolating the lfl/wox3 loss-of-function mutant and performing genetic crosses with the stf mutant. Lack of WOX3 function in M. truncatula leads to a loose-flower (lfl) phenotype, where defects are observed in sepal and petal development, but leaf blades are apparently normal. The stf lfl double mutant analysis revealed that STF and LFL act mainly independently with minor redundant functions in flower development, but LFL has no obvious role in leaf blade outgrowth in M. truncatula on its own or in combination with STF. Interestingly, LFL acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting TOPLESS in the same manner as STF does, and can substitute for STF function in leaf blade and flower development if expressed under the STF promoter. STF also complements the lfl mutant phenotype in the flower if expressed under the LFL promoter. Our data suggest that the STF/WOX1 and LFL/WOX3 genes of M. truncatula employ a similar mechanism of action in organizing cell proliferation for lateral outgrowth but may have evolved different cis elements to acquire distinct functions.
25557147	Combinations of Hd2 and Hd4 genes determine rice adaptability to Heilongjiang Province, northern limit of China.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Heading date is a key trait in rice domestication and adaption, and a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars in the Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost region of China, have to flower extremely early to fulfill their life cycle. However, the critical genes or different gene combinations controlling early flowering in this region have not been determined. QTL and candidate gene analysis revealed that Hd2/Ghd7.1/OsPRR37 plays a major role in controlling rice distribution in Heilongjiang. Further association analysis with a collection of rice cultivars demonstrated that another three major QTL genes (Hd4/Ghd7, Hd5/DTH8/Ghd8, and Hd1) also participate in regulating heading date under natural long day (LD) conditions. Hd2/Ghd7.1/OsPRR37 and Hd4/Ghd7 are two major QTLs and function additively. With the northward rice cultivation, the Hd2/Ghd7.1/OsPRR37 and Hd4/Ghd7 haplotypes became non-functional alleles. Hd1 might be non-functional in most Heilongjiang rice varieties, implying that recessive hd1 were selected during local rice breeding. Non-functional Hd5/DTH8/Ghd8 is very rare, but constitutes a potential target for breeding extremely early flowering cultivars. Our results indicated that diverse genetic combinations of Hd1, Hd2, Hd4, and Hd5 determined the different distribution of rice varieties in this northernmost province of China.
25263631	Global transcriptional profiling of a cold-tolerant rice variety under moderate cold stress reveals different cold stress response mechanisms.	2015	Physiol Plant	Gene expression profiling under severe cold stress (4°C) has been conducted in plants including rice. However, rice seedlings are frequently exposed to milder cold stresses under natural environments. To understand the responses of rice to milder cold stress, a moderately low temperature (8°C) was used for cold treatment prior to genome-wide profiling of gene expression in a cold-tolerant japonica variety, Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH). A total of 5557 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found at four time points during moderate cold stress. Both the DEGs and differentially expressed transcription factor genes were clustered into two groups based on their expression, suggesting a two-phase response to cold stress and a determinative role of transcription factors in the regulation of stress response. The induction of OsDREB2A under cold stress is reported for the first time in this study. Among the anti-oxidant enzyme genes, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were upregulated, suggesting that the glutathione system may serve as the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in LTH. Changes in expression of genes in signal transduction pathways for auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) imply their involvement in cold stress responses. The induction of ABA response genes and detection of enriched cis-elements in DEGs suggest that ABA signaling pathway plays a dominant role in the cold stress response. Our results suggest that rice responses to cold stress vary with the specific temperature imposed and the rice genotype.
25204204	The role of the large subunit in redox regulation of the rice endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.	2014	FEBS J	The starch regulatory enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is activated by 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) and inhibited by inorganic phosphate (Pi ). The activity of the plastid-localized enzyme is also subject to fine regulation by redox control in response to changing light and sugar levels. The less active oxidized form of the enzyme contains an inter-subunit disulfide bond formed between the pair of small subunit's Cys12 residues of the heterotetrameric enzyme. Although this cysteine residue is not conserved in the small subunits of cereal endosperm cytosolic AGPases, biochemical studies of the major rice endosperm enzyme indicate that the cytosolic isoform, like the plastidial enzymes, is subject to redox control. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reduced forms of the partially purified native and purified recombinant AGPases have 6- and 3.4-fold, respectively, more affinity to 3-PGA, rendering the enzymes more active at lower 3-PGA concentration than the non-reduced enzyme. Truncation of the large subunit by removal of N-terminal peptide resulted in a decrease in 3-PGA affinity and loss of redox response of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved cysteine residues at the N-terminal of the large subunit showed that C47 and C58, but not C12, are essential for proper redox response of the enzyme. Overall, our results show that the major rice endosperm AGPase activity is controlled by a combination of allosteric regulation and redox control, the latter through modification of the large subunit instead of the small subunit as evident in the plastid-localized enzyme.
25268721	Combined mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling of different pigmented rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds and correlation with antioxidant activities.	2014	Molecules	Nine varieties of pigmented rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds that were black, red, or white were used to perform metabolite profiling by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) and gas chromatography (GC) TOF-MS, to measure antioxidant activities. Clear grouping patterns determined by the color of the rice seeds were identified in principle component analysis (PCA) derived from UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Cyanidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, proanthocyanidin dimer, proanthocyanidin trimer, apigenin-6-C-glugosyl-8-C-arabiboside, tricin-O-rhamnoside-O-hexoside, and lipids were identified as significantly different secondary metabolites. In PCA score plots derived from GC-TOF-MS, Jakwangdo (JKD) and Ilpoom (IP) species were discriminated from the other rice seeds by PC1 and PC2. Valine, phenylalanine, adenosine, pyruvate, nicotinic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, gluconic acid, xylose, fructose, glucose, maltose, and myo-inositol were significantly different primary metabolites in JKD species, while GABA, asparagine, xylitol, and sucrose were significantly distributed in IP species. Analysis of antioxidant activities revealed that black and red rice seeds had higher activity than white rice seeds. Cyanidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, proanthocyanidin dimers, proanthocyanidin trimers, and catechin were highly correlated with antioxidant activities, and were more plentiful in black and red rice seeds. These results are expected to provide valuable information that could help improve and develop rice-breeding techniques.
25213398	A detailed analysis of the leaf rolling mutant sll2 reveals complex nature in regulation of bulliform cell development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Bulliform cells are large, thin-walled and highly vacuolated cells, and play an important role in controlling leaf rolling in response to drought and high temperature. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating bulliform cell development have not been well documented. Here, we report isolation and characterisation of a rice leaf-rolling mutant, named shallot-like 2 (sll2). The sll2 plants exhibit adaxially rolled leaves, starting from the sixth leaf stage, accompanied by increased photosynthesis and reduced plant height and tiller number. Histological analyses showed shrinkage of bulliform cells, resulting in inward-curved leaves. The mutant is recessive and revertible at a rate of 9%. The leaf rolling is caused by a T-DNA insertion. Cloning of the insertion using TAIL-PCR revealed that the T-DNA was inserted in the promoter region of LOC_Os07 g38664. Unexpectedly, the enhanced expression of LOC_Os07 g38664 by the 35S enhancer in the T-DNA is not responsible for the leaf rolling phenotype. Further, the enhancer also exerted a long-distance effect, including up-regulation of several bulliform cell-related genes. sll2 suppressed the outward leaf rolling of oul1 in the sll2oul1 double mutant. We conclude that leaf rolling in sll2 could be a result of the combined effect of multi-genes, implying a complex network in regulation of bulliform cell development.
25195053	Molecular cloning and expression of a novel MYB transcription factor gene in rubber tree.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	MYB family proteins regulate a variety of cellular processes in plants. Tapping panel dryness (TPD) in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) affects latex biosynthesis and causes serious losses to rubber producers. In this study, a novel SANT/MYB transcription factor gene down-regulated in TPD rubber tree, named as HbSM1, was isolated from rubber tree. The complete HbSM1 open reading frame (ORF) was 948 bp in length. The deduced HbSM1 protein is 315 amino acids. HbSM1 belonged to 1RMYB subfamily with a single SANT domain. Sequence alignment revealed that HbSM1 had high homology with MYB members from Ricinus communis and Manihot esculenta, with 72 and 78 % identity, respectively. Moreover, HbSM1 shared 56 % identity with Glycine max GmMYB176. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HbSM1, GmMYB176, rice OsMYBS2, and OsMYBS3 fell into the same cluster with 93 % bootstrap support value. Comparing expression among different tissues demonstrated that HbSM1 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, but it appeared to be preferentially expressed in leaf and latex. Furthermore, HbSM1 transcripts were significantly induced by various phytohormones (including gibberellic acid, ethephon, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid) and wounding treatments. These results suggested that HbSM1 might play multiple roles in plant development via different phytohormones signaling pathways.
25205576	Breeding high-yielding drought-tolerant rice: genetic variations and conventional and molecular approaches.	2014	J Exp Bot	The increased occurrence and severity of drought stress have led to a high yield decline in rice in recent years in drought-affected areas. Drought research at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) over the past decade has concentrated on direct selection for grain yield under drought. This approach has led to the successful development and release of 17 high-yielding drought-tolerant rice varieties in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. In addition to this, 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) showing a large effect against high-yielding drought-susceptible popular varieties were identified using grain yield as a selection criterion. Six of these (qDTY 1.1 , qDTY 2.2 , qDTY 3.1 , qDTY 3.2 , qDTY 6.1 , and qDTY 12.1 ) showed an effect against two or more high-yielding genetic backgrounds in both the lowland and upland ecosystem, indicating their usefulness in increasing the grain yield of rice under drought. The yield of popular rice varieties IR64 and Vandana has been successfully improved through a well-planned marker-assisted backcross breeding approach, and QTL introgression in several other popular varieties is in progress. The identification of large-effect QTLs for grain yield under drought and the higher yield increase under drought obtained through the use of these QTLs (which has not been reported in other cereals) indicate that rice, because of its continuous cultivation in two diverse ecosystems (upland, drought tolerant, and lowland, drought susceptible), has benefited from the existence of larger genetic variability than in other cereals. This can be successfully exploited using marker-assisted breeding.
25253885	Grain setting defect1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance.	2014	Plant Physiol	Effective grain filling is one of the key determinants of grain setting in rice (Oryza sativa). Grain setting defect1 (GSD1), which encodes a putative remorin protein, was found to affect grain setting in rice. Investigation of the phenotype of a transfer DNA insertion mutant (gsd1-Dominant) with enhanced GSD1 expression revealed abnormalities including a reduced grain setting rate, accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves, and lower soluble sugar content in the phloem exudates. GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells. Experimental evidence suggests that the phenotype of the gsd1-Dominant mutant is caused by defects in the grain-filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem. GSD1 functioned in affecting PD conductance by interacting with rice ACTIN1 in association with the PD callose binding protein1. Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.
25231970	The bifunctional plant receptor, OsCERK1, regulates both chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Plants are constantly exposed to threats from pathogenic microbes and thus developed an innate immune system to protect themselves. On the other hand, many plants also have the ability to establish endosymbiosis with beneficial microbes such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or rhizobial bacteria, which improves the growth of host plants. How plants evolved these systems managing such opposite plant-microbe interactions is unclear. We show here that knockout (KO) mutants of OsCERK1, a rice receptor kinase essential for chitin signaling, were impaired not only for chitin-triggered defense responses but also for AM symbiosis, indicating the bifunctionality of OsCERK1 in defense and symbiosis. On the other hand, a KO mutant of OsCEBiP, which forms a receptor complex with OsCERK1 and is essential for chitin-triggered immunity, established mycorrhizal symbiosis normally. Therefore, OsCERK1 but not chitin-triggered immunity is required for AM symbiosis. Furthermore, experiments with chimeric receptors showed that the kinase domains of OsCERK1 and homologs from non-leguminous, mycorrhizal plants could trigger nodulation signaling in legume-rhizobium interactions as the kinase domain of Nod factor receptor1 (NFR1), which is essential for triggering the nodulation program in leguminous plants, did. Because leguminous plants are believed to have developed the rhizobial symbiosis on the basis of AM symbiosis, our results suggest that the symbiotic function of ancestral CERK1 in AM symbiosis enabled the molecular evolution to leguminous NFR1 and resulted in the establishment of legume-rhizobia symbiosis. These results also suggest that OsCERK1 and homologs serve as a molecular switch that activates defense or symbiotic responses depending on the infecting microbes.
25239514	Molecular phylogenetics and comparative modeling of MnSOD, an enzyme involved during environmental stress conditions in Oryza sativa.	2014	Interdiscip Sci	Superoxide dismutases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) acts as first line of defense against oxidative and genetic stress. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), found in mitochondria or peroxisomes, contains Mn (III) at the active site. The three dimensional structure of MnSOD of Oryza sativa is not yet available in protein data bank so we have predicted the structure model of O. sativa MnSOD using homology modeling. The predicted model can further be explored for identification of ligand binding sites which may be useful for understanding specific role in functional site residues during catalysis. This study also demonstrated that the phylogenetic analysis of O. sativa MnSOD protein with distinct dicot and monocot plant species. The MnSOD protein of O. sativa has shown similarity with both monocot and as well as dicot plant species.
25380642	Metabolism of reactive oxygen species in cytoplasmic male sterility of rice by marking upmost pulvinus interval.	2015	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in plant cell are thought to be important inducible factors of cell apoptosis if excessively accumulated in cells. To elucidate the metabolic mechanism of MDA production and scavenging in the cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) rice, CMS line and maintainer were employed for studying the relationship at different developmental stages by marking upmost pulvinus interval method of experiment. The results showed that the panicles and leaves of the CMS line had a noticeable higher MDA content than those of maintainer line at all five stages that had been investigated (p < 0.05). MDA content in the CMS line in the flag leaves of auricle in the distance 0 mm stage (the meiosis stage) was the highest of the five stages. The increase of MDA contents in sterile panicles and leaves had inducible effects on the enzymic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). However, at the abortion peak stage, MDA was excessively accumulated and antioxidant enzymic activity reduced significantly, resulting in the generation and scavenging of MDA out of balance.
25371505	Genetic dissection of ozone tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by a genome-wide association study.	2015	J Exp Bot	Tropospheric ozone causes various negative effects on plants and affects the yield and quality of agricultural crops. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) to determine candidate loci associated with ozone tolerance. A diversity panel consisting of 328 accessions representing all subgroups of O. sativa was exposed to ozone stress at 60 nl l(-1) for 7h every day throughout the growth season, or to control conditions. Averaged over all genotypes, ozone significantly affected biomass-related traits (plant height -1.0%, shoot dry weight -15.9%, tiller number -8.3%, grain weight -9.3%, total panicle weight -19.7%, single panicle weight -5.5%) and biochemical/physiological traits (symptom formation, SPAD value -4.4%, foliar lignin content +3.4%). A wide range of genotypic variance in response to ozone stress were observed in all phenotypes. Association mapping based on more than 30 000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers yielded 16 significant markers throughout the genome by applying a significance threshold of P<0.0001. Furthermore, by determining linkage disequilibrium blocks associated with significant SNPs, we gained a total of 195 candidate genes for these traits. The following sequence analysis revealed a number of novel polymorphisms in two candidate genes for the formation of visible leaf symptoms, a RING and an EREBP gene, both of which are involved in cell death and stress defence reactions. This study demonstrated substantial natural variation of responses to ozone in rice and the possibility of using GWAS in elucidating the genetic factors underlying ozone tolerance.
25399019	Semi-dwarfism and lodging tolerance in tef (Eragrostis tef) is linked to a mutation in the α-Tubulin 1 gene.	2015	J Exp Bot	Genetic improvement of native crops is a new and promising strategy to combat hunger in the developing world. Tef is the major staple food crop for approximately 50 million people in Ethiopia. As an indigenous cereal, it is well adapted to diverse climatic and soil conditions; however, its productivity is extremely low mainly due to susceptibility to lodging. Tef has a tall and weak stem, liable to lodge (or fall over), which is aggravated by wind, rain, or application of nitrogen fertilizer. To circumvent this problem, the first semi-dwarf lodging-tolerant tef line, called kegne, was developed from an ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-mutagenized population. The response of kegne to microtubule-depolymerizing and -stabilizing drugs, as well as subsequent gene sequencing and segregation analysis, suggests that a defect in the α-Tubulin gene is functionally and genetically tightly linked to the kegne phenotype. In diploid species such as rice, homozygous mutations in α-Tubulin genes result in extreme dwarfism and weak stems. In the allotetraploid tef, only one homeologue is mutated, and the presence of the second intact α-Tubulin gene copy confers the agriculturally beneficial semi-dwarf and lodging-tolerant phenotype. Introgression of kegne into locally adapted and popular tef cultivars in Ethiopia will increase the lodging tolerance in the tef germplasm and, as a result, will improve the productivity of this valuable crop.
25398618	Expression of a cystatin transgene can confer resistance to root lesion nematodes in Lilium longiflorum cv. 'Nellie White'.	2015	Transgenic Res	Lilium longiflorum cv. 'Nellie White' assumes a great economic importance as cut flowers, being one of the most valuable species (annual pot plants value above $20,000,000) in terms of wholesales in the US. The root lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans (RLN) constitutes one of the main pests for lily producers due to the significant root damage it causes. Our efforts have focused on the generation of soybean hairy roots (as a transient test model) and stable transgenic lilies overexpressing a modified rice cystatin (Oc-IΔD86) transgene and challenged with root lesion nematodes. Lily transformation was achieved by gene gun co-bombardment using both a pBluescript-based vector containing the cystatin gene and pDM307 that contains a bar gene for phosphinothricin selection. Both soybean hairy roots and lilies overexpressing the OcIΔD86 transgene exhibited enhanced resistance to RLN infection by means of nematode reduction up to 75 ± 5% on the total number of nematodes. In addition, lily plants overexpressing OcIΔD86 displayed an increase of plant mass and better growth performance in comparison to wild-type plants, thereby demonstrating an alternative strategy for increasing the yield and reducing nematode damage to this important floral crop.
25512028	Biofortification of rice with lysine using endogenous histones.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Rice is the most consumed cereal grain in the world, but deficient in the essential amino acid lysine. Therefore, people in developing countries with limited food diversity who rely on rice as their major food source may suffer from malnutrition. Biofortification of stable crops by genetic engineering provides a fast and sustainable method to solve this problem. In this study, two endogenous rice lysine-rich histone proteins, RLRH1 and RLRH2, were over-expressed in rice seeds to achieve lysine biofortification. Their protein sequences passed an allergic sequence-based homology test. Their accumulations in rice seeds were raised to a moderate level by the use of a modified rice glutelin 1 promoter with lowered expression strength to avoid the occurrence of physiological abnormalities like unfolded protein response. The expressed proteins were further targeted to protein storage vacuoles for stable storage using a glutelin 1 signal peptide. The lysine content in the transgenic rice seeds was enhanced by up to 35 %, while other essential amino acids remained balanced, meeting the nutritional standards of the World Health Organization. No obvious unfolded protein response was detected. Different degrees of chalkiness, however, were detected in the transgenic seeds, and were positively correlated with both the levels of accumulated protein and lysine enhancement. This study offered a solution to the lysine deficiency in rice, while at the same time addressing concerns about food safety and physiological abnormalities in biofortified crops.
25551672	Identification of quantitative trait loci for phosphorus use efficiency traits in rice using a high density SNP map.	2014	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Soil phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major limiting factors to crop production. The development of crop varieties with improved P use efficiency (PUE) is an important strategy for sustainable agriculture. The objectives of this research were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to PUE traits using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map and to estimate the epistatic interactions and environmental effects in rice (Oryza sativa L.).

RESULTS: We conducted a two-year field experiment under low and normal P conditions using a recombinant inbred population of rice derived from Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 (indica). We investigated three yield traits, biomass (BIOM), harvest index (HI), and grain yield (Yield), and eight PUE traits: total P uptake (PUP), P harvest index (PHI), grain P use efficiency (gPUE) based on P accumulation in grains, straw P use efficiency (strPUE) based on P accumulation in straw, P use efficiency for biomass (PUEb) and for grain yield (PUEg) based on P accumulation in the whole plant, P translocation (PT), and P translocation efficiency (PTE). Of the 36 QTLs and 24 epistatic interactions identified, 26 QTLs and 12 interactions were detected for PUE traits. The environment affected seven QTLs and three epistatic interactions. Four QTLs (qPHI1 and qPHI2 for PHI, qPUEg2 for PUEg, and qPTE8 for PTE) with strong effects were environmentally independent. By comparing our results with similar QTLs in previous studies, three QTLs for PUE traits (qPUP1 and qPUP10 for PUP, and qPHI6 for PHI) were found across various genetic backgrounds. Seven regions were shared by QTLs for yield and PUE traits.

CONCLUSION: Most QTLs linked to PUE traits were different from those linked to yield traits, suggesting different genetic controls underlying these two traits. Those chromosomal regions with large effects that are not affected by different environments are promising for improving P use efficiency. The seven regions shared by QTLs linked to yield and PUE traits imply the possibility of the simultaneous improvement of yield and PUE traits.
25471115	Metabolic and co-expression network-based analyses associated with nitrate response in rice.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Understanding gene expression and metabolic re-programming that occur in response to limiting nitrogen (N) conditions in crop plants is crucial for the ongoing progress towards the development of varieties with improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). To unravel new details on the molecular and metabolic responses to N availability in a major food crop, we conducted analyses on a weighted gene co-expression network and metabolic profile data obtained from leaves and roots of rice plants adapted to sufficient and limiting N as well as after shifting them to limiting (reduction) and sufficient (induction) N conditions.

RESULTS: A gene co-expression network representing clusters of rice genes with similar expression patterns across four nitrogen conditions and two tissue types was generated. The resulting 18 clusters were analyzed for enrichment of significant gene ontology (GO) terms. Four clusters exhibited significant correlation with limiting and reducing nitrate treatments. Among the identified enriched GO terms, those related to nucleoside/nucleotide, purine and ATP binding, defense response, sugar/carbohydrate binding, protein kinase activities, cell-death and cell wall enzymatic activity are enriched. Although a subset of functional categories are more broadly associated with the response of rice organs to limiting N and N reduction, our analyses suggest that N reduction elicits a response distinguishable from that to adaptation to limiting N, particularly in leaves. This observation is further supported by metabolic profiling which shows that several compounds in leaves change proportionally to the nitrate level (i.e. higher in sufficient N vs. limiting N) and respond with even higher levels when the nitrate level is reduced. Notably, these compounds are directly involved in N assimilation, transport, and storage (glutamine, asparagine, glutamate and allantoin) and extend to most amino acids. Based on these data, we hypothesize that plants respond by rapidly mobilizing stored vacuolar nitrate when N deficit is perceived, and that the response likely involves phosphorylation signal cascades and transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: The co-expression network analysis and metabolic profiling performed in rice pinpoint the relevance of signal transduction components and regulation of N mobilization in response to limiting N conditions and deepen our understanding of N responses and N use in crops.
25520726	Elucidation of the molecular responses to waterlogging in Jatropha roots by transcriptome profiling.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) is a promising oil-seed crop for biodiesel production. However, the species is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can result in stunted growth and yield loss. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to waterlogging in Jatropha remain elusive. Here, the transcriptome adjustment of Jatropha roots to waterlogging was examined by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The results indicated that 24 h of waterlogging caused significant changes in mRNA abundance of 1968 genes. Comprehensive gene ontology and functional enrichment analysis of root transcriptome revealed that waterlogging promoted responses to hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. On the other hand, the stress inhibited carbohydrate synthesis, cell wall biogenesis, and growth. The results also highlighted the roles of ethylene, nitrate, and nitric oxide in waterlogging acclimation. In addition, transcriptome profiling identified 85 waterlogging-induced transcription factors including members of AP2/ERF, MYB, and WRKY families implying that reprogramming of gene expression is a vital mechanism for waterlogging acclimation. Comparative analysis of differentially regulated transcripts in response to waterlogging among Arabidopsis, gray poplar, Jatropha, and rice further revealed not only conserved but species-specific regulation. Our findings unraveled the molecular responses to waterlogging in Jatropha and provided new perspectives for developing a waterlogging tolerant cultivar in the future.
25511432	Comprehensive gene expression analysis of rice aleurone cells: probing the existence of an alternative gibberellin receptor.	2015	Plant Physiol	Current gibberellin (GA) research indicates that GA must be perceived in plant nuclei by its cognate receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1). Recognition of GA by GID1 relieves the repression mediated by the DELLA protein, a model known as the GID1-DELLA GA perception system. There have been reports of potential GA-binding proteins in the plasma membrane that perceive GA and induce α-amylase expression in cereal aleurone cells, which is mechanistically different from the GID1-DELLA system. Therefore, we examined the expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) α-amylase genes in rice mutants impaired in the GA receptor (gid1) and the DELLA repressor (slender rice1; slr1) and confirmed their lack of response to GA in gid1 mutants and constitutive expression in slr1 mutants. We also examined the expression of GA-regulated genes by genome-wide microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses and confirmed that all GA-regulated genes are modulated by the GID1-DELLA system. Furthermore, we studied the regulatory network involved in GA signaling by using a set of mutants defective in genes involved in GA perception and gene expression, namely gid1, slr1, gid2 (a GA-related F-box protein mutant), and gamyb (a GA-related trans-acting factor mutant). Almost all GA up-regulated genes were regulated by the four named GA-signaling components. On the other hand, GA down-regulated genes showed different expression patterns with respect to GID2 and GAMYB (e.g. a considerable number of genes are not controlled by GAMYB or GID2 and GAMYB). Based on these observations, we present a comprehensive discussion of the intricate network of GA-regulated genes in rice aleurone cells.
25279141	In silico analysis of high affinity potassium transporter (HKT) isoforms in different plants.	2014	Aquat Biosyst	BACKGROUND: High affinity potassium transporters (HKTs) are located in the plasma membrane of the vessels and have significant influence on salt tolerance in some plants. They exclude Na(+) from the parenchyma cells to reduce Na(+) concentration. Despite many studies, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and the exact functions of HKTs within different genomic backgrounds are relatively unknown. In this study, various bioinformatics techniques, including promoter analysis, identification of HKT-surrounding genes, and construction of gene networks, were applied to investigate the HKT regulatory mechanism.

RESULTS: Promoter analysis showed that rice HKTs carry ABA response elements. Additionally, jasmonic acid response elements were detected on promoter region of TmHKT1;5. In silico synteny highlighted several unknown and new loci near rice, Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patent HKTs, which may play a significant role in salt stress tolerance in concert with HKTs. Gene network prediction unravelled that crosstalk between jasmonate and ethylene reduces AtHKT1;1 expression. Furthermore, antiporter and transferase proteins were found in AtHKT1;1 gene network. Interestingly, regulatory elements on the promoter region of HKT in wild genotype (TmHKT1;5) were more frequent and variable than the ones in cultivated wheat (TaHKT1;5) which provides the possibility of rapid response and better understanding of environmental conditions for wild genotype.

CONCLUSION: Detecting ABA and jasmonic acid response elements on promoter regions of HKTs provide valuable clues on underlying regulatory mechanisms of HKTs. In silico synteny and pathway discovery indicated several candidates which act in concert with HKTs in stress condition. We highlighted different arrangement of regulatory elements on promoter region of wild wheat (TmHKT1;5) compared to bread wheat (TaHKT1;5) in this study.
25228384	Comparative expression profiling of miRNAs between the cytoplasmic male sterile line MeixiangA and its maintainer line MeixiangB during rice anther development.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: miRNAs are involved in the pollen development during the CMS occurrence in rice. miRNAs are 20-24 nt endogenously expressed small RNAs that play key roles in the regulation of many growth and developmental processes in plants. The knowledge on cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) regulation by miRNAs in rice is rather limited. In this study, Illumina sequencing was employed to examine the expression profiles of rice anther miRNAs from the CMS line MeixiangA (MxA) and its maintainer line MeixiangB (MxB). A total of 518 known miRNAs and 144 novel miRNAs were identified during rice anther development. Based on the number of sequencing reads, a total of 24 miRNAs were discovered to be differentially expressed between MxA and MxB, and the results were partially validated by qRT-PCR. Among these, 16 miRNAs were decreased and 8 miRNAs were increased in MxA compared with MxB. Target prediction showed that they target genes encoding EF-hand family proteins, F-box domain-containing proteins, MYB transcription factors, PPR-containing proteins and transposons. The expression patterns for targets of osa-miR528, osa-miR5793, osa-miR1432, osa-miR159, osa-miR812d, osa-miR2118c, osa-miR172d and osa-miR5498 were selectively examined, and the results showed that there was a negative correlation on the expression patterns between miRNAs and their targets. These targets have previously been reported to be related with pollen development and male sterility, suggesting that miRNAs might act as regulators of CMS occurrence in rice anthers. Furthermore, miRNA editing events were observed. The U → C and U → A editing phenomenon was validated by molecular cloning and sequencing. These findings contribute to our understanding of the roles of miRNAs during anther development and CMS occurrence in rice.
25231963	Whole-plant growth and N utilization in transgenic rice plants with increased or decreased Rubisco content under different CO2 partial pressures.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) strongly limits photosynthesis at lower CO2 concentration [CO2] whereas [corrected] Rubisco limitation is cancelled by elevated [CO2]. Therefore, increase or reduction in Rubisco content by transformation with a sense or an antisense RBCS construct are expected to alter the biomass production under different CO2 levels. RBCS-sense (125% Rubisco of wild-type) and -antisense (35% Rubisco of wild-type) rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were grown for 63 days at three different CO2 levels: low [CO2] (28 Pa), normal [CO2] (40 Pa) and elevated [CO2] (120 Pa). The biomass of RBCS-sense plants was 32% and 15% greater at low [CO2] and normal [CO2] than that of the wild-type plants, respectively, but did not differ at elevated [CO2]. Conversely, the biomass of RBCS-antisense plants was the smallest at low [CO2]. Thus, overproduction of Rubisco was effective for biomass production at low [CO2]. Greater biomass production at low [CO2] in RBCS-sense plants was caused by an increase in the net assimilation rate, and associated with an increase in the amount of N uptake. Furthermore, Rubisco overproduction in RBCS-sense plants was also promoted at low [CO2]. Although it seems that low [CO2]-growth additionally stimulates the effect of RBCS overexpression, such a phenomenon observed at low [CO2] was mediated through an increase in total leaf N content. Thus, the dependence of the growth improvement in RBCS-sense rice on growth [CO2] was closely related to the degree of Rubisco overproduction which was accompanied not only by leaf N content but also by whole plant N content.
25188286	Evidence for a transketolase-mediated metabolic checkpoint governing biotrophic growth in rice cells by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	PLoS Pathog	The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae threatens global food security through the widespread destruction of cultivated rice. Foliar infection requires a specialized cell called an appressorium that generates turgor to force a thin penetration hypha through the rice cuticle and into the underlying epidermal cells, where the fungus grows for the first days of infection as a symptomless biotroph. Understanding what controls biotrophic growth could open new avenues for developing sustainable blast intervention programs. Here, using molecular genetics and live-cell imaging, we dismantled M. oryzae glucose-metabolizing pathways to reveal that the transketolase enzyme, encoded by TKL1, plays an essential role in facilitating host colonization during rice blast disease. In the absence of transketolase, Δtkl1 mutant strains formed functional appressoria that penetrated rice cuticles successfully and developed invasive hyphae (IH) in rice cells from primary hyphae. However, Δtkl1 could not undertake sustained biotrophic growth or cell-to-cell movement. Transcript data and observations using fluorescently labeled histone H1:RFP fusion proteins indicated Δtkl1 mutant strains were alive in host cells but were delayed in mitosis. Mitotic delay could be reversed and IH growth restored by the addition of exogenous ATP, a metabolite depleted in Δtkl1 mutant strains. We show that ATP might act via the TOR signaling pathway, and TOR is likely a downstream target of activation for TKL1. TKL1 is also involved in controlling the migration of appressorial nuclei into primary hyphae in host cells. When taken together, our results indicate transketolase has a novel role in mediating--via ATP and TOR signaling--an in planta-specific metabolic checkpoint that controls nuclear migration from appressoria into primary hyphae, prevents mitotic delay in early IH and promotes biotrophic growth. This work thus provides new information about the metabolic strategies employed by M. oryzae to enable rice cell colonization.
25069855	Development of an iron-enriched high-yieldings indica rice cultivar by introgression of a high-iron trait from transgenic iron-biofortified rice.	2014	Plant Foods Hum Nutr	Low level of iron in staple food crops is one reason for the predominance of iron-deficiency anemia in developing countries. Most of the iron in rice grains accumulates in the outer aleurone layer and embryo, which are removed during milling, and the edible endosperm contains very low amounts of iron. In an effort to increase iron nutrition, we report here the transgene introgression of a high-iron trait into a high-yielding indica rice cultivar. The ferritin gene from soybean (soyfer1) was introduced into rice plants through interbreeding between soybean ferritin-overexpressing transgenic IR68144 and the high-yielding cultivar Swarna. The stable integration of the soyfer1 gene was confirmed in the BC2F4 generation, and the hybrid seeds showed 2.6-fold soybean ferritin gene expression over the recurrent parent Swarna. The hybrid milled seeds revealed a 2.54-fold increase in iron and 1.54-fold increase in zinc compared to Swarna. Agronomic data and an SSR marker analysis of the hybrid rice plants were taken into account for NIL character identification.
25183458	Transcriptomic dissection of the rice-Burkholderia glumae interaction.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Bacterial panicle blight caused by the bacterium Burkholderia glumae is an emerging disease of rice in the United States. Not much is known about this disease, the disease cycle or any source of disease resistance. To understand the interaction between rice and Burkholderia glumae, we used transcriptomics via next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatics to identify differentially expressed transcripts between resistant and susceptible interactions and formulate a model for rice resistance to the disease.

RESULTS: Using inoculated young seedlings as sample tissues, we identified unique transcripts involved with resistance to bacterial panicle blight, including a PIF-like ORF1 and verified differential expression of some selected genes using qRT-PCR. These transcripts, which include resistance genes of the NBS-LRR type, kinases, transcription factors, transporters and expressed proteins with functions that are not known, have not been reported in other pathosystems including rice blast or bacterial blight. Further, functional annotation analysis reveals enrichment of defense response and programmed cell death (biological processes); ATP and protein binding (molecular functions); and mitochondrion-related (cell component) transcripts in the resistant interaction.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, we formulated a model for rice resistance to bacterial panicle blight that involves an activation of previously unknown resistance genes and their activation partners upon challenge with B. glumae. Other interesting findings are that 1) though these resistance transcripts were up-regulated upon inoculation in the resistant interaction, some of them were already expressed in the water-inoculated control from the resistant genotype, but not in the water- and bacterium-inoculated samples from the susceptible genotype; 2) rice may have co-opted an ORF that was previously a part of a transposable element to aid in the resistance mechanism; and 3) resistance may have existed immediately prior to rice domestication.
25231964	In-depth proteomic analysis of rice embryo reveals its important roles in seed germination.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Seed germination is a complex physiological process that allows the seed embryo to grow and develop into a photosynthetic organism. The two major constituents of rice seed include the embryo and endosperm, with embryo being of much significance despite its small size. In this study, we conducted a systematic proteomic analysis of the embryos dissected from rice seed at different stages of germination through a combination of gel-based and gel-free strategies. In total, 343 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, 191 were decreased and 152 were increased in terms of expression levels. All these proteins could be sorted into 11 functional groups based on MapMan analysis. Some starch biosynthesis-related enzymes such as starch branching enzyme, granule-bound starch synthase 1 and starch synthase increased during the early stage of germination and then decreased at the late stage, which was similar to the expressional patterns of glycolysis-related enzymes. However, tricarboxylic acid cycle-related enzymes only increased at the later stage. It was also found that sucrose might be an important intermediate for the biosynthesis of starch in embryos. Furthermore, gel-based proteomic analysis of the dissected endosperm showed that the biological processes in the endosperm were heavily regulated by the embryo. This study could provide some new insights into the distinct roles of the embryo and endosperm in rice seed germination.
25261161	Phenotypic expression of blast resistance gene Pi54 is not affected by its chromosomal position.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: This is a novel report in which chromosomal position of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54 was not found to affect significantly the resistance phenotype or morphological traits. Blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious constraint in rice production at global level. Pi54 gene imparts resistance against M. oryzae. Three different transgenic lines containing Pi54 and its orthologue Pi54rh were shown to be resistant to different races of M. oryzae. To determine the chromosomal location of Pi54 gene in transgenic lines, inverse PCR was performed. Our analysis showed that in two transgenic lines, Pi54 gene was integrated on chromosomes 6 and 10 at 12.94 and 22.30 Mb, respectively. Similarly, Pi54rh allele was integrated on chromosome 1 at 16.25 Mb. The Pi54 gene present on chromosome 6 was located in a non-coding region whereas in the other TP-Pi54 line, the gene was introgressed on chromosome 10 in between the coding region of SAP domain gene. The Pi54rh was also located in the non coding region flanked by the retrotransposon genes. These rice lines were evaluated for eight different traits related to seed and plant morphology and agronomic features for two consecutive years. The transgenic lines containing Pi54 gene have higher tiller number, grain weight, epicotyl length, and yield compared to the non-transgenic control. Multivariate correlation analysis shows that blast resistance was positively correlated with the number of tillers; thousand grain weight and epicotyl length. These results will facilitate precise utilization of Pi54 gene and its orthologue in breeding programs for the development of rice cultivars with broad spectrum and durable resistance to M. oryzae.
25183745	Chloroplast-encoded serotonin N-acetyltransferase in the red alga Pyropia yezoensis: gene transition to the nucleus from chloroplasts.	2015	J Exp Bot	Melatonin biosynthesis involves the N-acetylation of arylalkylamines such as serotonin, which is catalysed by serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), the penultimate enzyme of melatonin biosynthesis in both animals and plants. Here, we report the functional characterization of a putative N-acetyltransferase gene in the chloroplast genome of the alga laver (Pyropia yezoensis, formerly known as Porphyra yezoensis) with homology to the rice SNAT gene. To confirm that the putative Pyropia yezoensis SNAT (PySNAT) gene encodes an SNAT, we cloned the full-length chloroplastidic PySNAT gene by PCR and purified the recombinant PySNAT protein from Escherichia coli. PySNAT was 174 aa and had 50% amino acid identity with cyanobacteria SNAT. Purified recombinant PySNAT showed a peak activity at 55 °C with a K m of 467 µM and V max of 28 nmol min-1 mg(-1) of protein. Unlike other plant SNATs, PySNAT localized to the cytoplasm due to a lack of N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides. Melatonin was present at 0.16ng g(-1) of fresh mass but increased during heat stress. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence suggested that PySNAT has evolved from the cyanobacteria SNAT gene via endosymbiotic gene transfer. Additionally, the chloroplast transit peptides of plant SNATs were acquired 1500 million years ago, concurrent with the appearance of green algae.
25105804	AvrXa7-Xa7 mediated defense in rice can be suppressed by transcriptional activator-like effectors TAL6 and TAL11a from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The closely related plant pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and X. oryzae pv. oryzae cause bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and bacterial leaf blight (BLB), respectively, in rice. Unlike X. oryzae pv. oryzae, endogenous avirulence-resistance (avr-R) gene interactions have not been identified in the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola-rice pathosystem, though both X. oryzae pv. oryzicola and X. oryzae pv. oryzae possess transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALE), which are known to modulate R or S genes in rice. In this report, avrXa7, avrXa10, and avrXa27 from X. oryzae pv. oryzae were transferred into YNB0-17 and RS105, hypovirulent and hypervirulent strains, respectively, of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. When YNB0-17 containing avrXa7, avrXa10, or avrXa27 was inoculated to rice, hypersensitive responses (HR) were elicited in rice cultivars containing the R genes Xa7, Xa10, and Xa27, respectively. By contrast, RS105 expressing avrXa27 elicited an HR in a rice cultivar containing Xa27 but the expression of avrXa7 and avrXa10 in RS105 did not result in HR in rice cultivars containing Xa7 and Xa10, correspondingly. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that YNB0-17 possesses only approximately nine putative tale genes, whereas the hypervirulent RS105 contains at least 20. Although YNB0-17 contains an intact type III secretion system (T3SS), its genome is lacking the T3SS effector genes avrRxo1 and xopO, which are present in RS105. The introduction of avrRxo1 and xopO into YNB0-17 did not suppress avrXa7- or avrXa10-triggered immunity in rice. However, the transference of individual tale genes from RS105 into YNB0-17 led to the identification of tal6 and tal11a that suppressed avrXa7-Xa7-mediated defense. Thus, YNB0-17 may be a useful recipient for discovering such suppressors. This is the first report that co-evolutionally generated tale genes in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola suppress gene-for-gene defense against BLB, which may explain the lack of BLS-resistant cultivars.
25200087	Large chromosomal deletions and heritable small genetic changes induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in rice.	2014	Nucleic Acids Res	The Cas9/sgRNA of the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a robust technology for targeted gene editing in various organisms, including plants, where Cas9/sgRNA-mediated small deletions/insertions at single cleavage sites have been reported in transient and stable transformations, although genetic transmission of edits has been reported only in Arabidopsis and rice. Large chromosomal excision between two remote nuclease-targeted loci has been reported only in a few non-plant species. Here we report in rice Cas9/sgRNA-induced large chromosomal segment deletions, the inheritance of genome edits in multiple generations and construction of a set of facile vectors for high-efficiency, multiplex gene targeting. Four sugar efflux transporter genes were modified in rice at high efficiency; the most efficient system yielding 87-100% editing in T0 transgenic plants, all with di-allelic edits. Furthermore, genetic crosses segregating Cas9/sgRNA transgenes away from edited genes yielded several genome-edited but transgene-free rice plants. We also demonstrated proof-of-efficiency of Cas9/sgRNAs in producing large chromosomal deletions (115-245 kb) involving three different clusters of genes in rice protoplasts and verification of deletions of two clusters in regenerated T0 generation plants. Together, these data demonstrate the power of our Cas9/sgRNA platform for targeted gene/genome editing in rice and other crops, enabling both basic research and agricultural applications.
25197968	A novel binary T-vector with the GFP reporter gene for promoter characterization.	2014	PLoS One	Several strategies have been developed to clone PCR fragments into desired vectors. However, most of commercially available T-vectors are not binary vectors and cannot be directly used for Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation. In this study, a novel binary T-vector was constructed by integrating two AhdI restriction sites into the backbone vector pCAMBIA 1300. The T-vector also contains a GFP reporter gene and thus, can be used to analyze promoter activity by monitoring the reporter gene. On the other hand, identification and characterization of various promoters not only benefit the functional annotation of their genes but also provide alternative candidates to be used to drive interesting genes for plant genetic improvement by transgenesis. More than 1,000 putative pollen-specific rice genes have been identified in a genome-wide level. Among them, 67 highly expressed genes were further characterized. One of the pollen-specific genes LOC_Os10g35930 was further surveyed in its expression patterns with more details by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Finally, its promoter activity was further investigated by analyzing transgenic rice plants carrying the promoter::GFP cassette, which was constructed from the newly developed T-vector. The reporter GFP gene expression in these transgenic plants showed that the promoter was active only in mature but not in germinated pollens.
25375147	Bt rice expressing Cry2Aa does not harm Cyrtorhinus lividipennis, a main predator of the nontarget herbivore Nilapavarta lugens.	2014	PLoS One	T2A-1 is a newly developed transgenic rice that expresses a synthesized cry2Aa gene driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter. T2A-1 exhibits high resistance against lepidopteran pests of rice. The brown planthopper, Nilapavarta lugens (Stål), is a main nontarget sap-sucking insect pest of rice, and Cyrtorhinus lividipennis (Reuter) is the major predator of the eggs and young nymphs of planthoppers. As C. lividipennis may expose to the Cry2Aa protein via N. lugens, it is therefore essential to assess the potential effects of transgenic cry2Aa rice on this predator. In the present study, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the ecological risk of transgenic cry2Aa rice to C. lividipennis: (1) a direct feeding experiment in which C. lividipennis was fed an artificial diet containing Cry2Aa at the dose of 10-time higher than that it may encounter in the realistic field condition; (2) a tritrophic experiment in which the Cry2Aa protein was delivered to C. lividipennis indirectly through prey eggs or nymphs; (3) a realistic field experiment in which the population dynamics of C. lividipennis were investigated using vacuum-suction. Both direct exposure to elevated doses of the Cry2Aa protein and prey-mediated exposure to realistic doses of the protein did not result in significant detrimental effects on the development, survival, female ratio and body weight of C. lividipennis. No significant differences in population density and population dynamics were observed between C. lividipennis in transgenic cry2Aa and nontransgenic rice fields. It may be concluded that transgenic cry2Aa rice had no detrimental effects on C. lividipennis. This study represents the first report of an assessment continuum for the effects of transgenic cry2Aa rice on C. lividipennis.
25386911	OsARF16 is involved in cytokinin-mediated inhibition of phosphate transport and phosphate signaling in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Plant responses to phytohormone stimuli are the most important biological features for plants to survive in a complex environment. Cytokinin regulates growth and nutrient homeostasis, such as the phosphate (Pi) starvation response and Pi uptake in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying how cytokinin participates in Pi uptake and Pi signaling are largely unknown. In this study, we found that OsARF16 is required for the cytokinin response and is involved in the negative regulation of Pi uptake and Pi signaling by cytokinin.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The mutant osarf16 showed an obvious resistance to exogenous cytokinin treatment and the expression level of the OsARF16 gene was considerably up-regulated by cytokinin. Cytokinin (6-BA) application suppressed Pi uptake and the Pi starvation response in wild-type Nipponbare (NIP) and all these responses were compromised in the osarf16 mutant. Our data showed that cytokinin inhibits the transport of Pi from the roots to the shoots and that OsARF16 is involved in this process. The Pi content in the osarf16 mutant was much higher than in NIP under 6-BA treatment. The expressions of PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) genes, phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced (PSI) genes and purple PAPase genes were higher in the osarf16 mutant than in NIP under cytokinin treatment.

CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a new biological function for OsARF16 in the cytokinin-mediated inhibition of Pi uptake and Pi signaling in rice.
25399831	The receptor kinase CERK1 has dual functions in symbiosis and immunity signalling.	2015	Plant J	The establishment of symbiotic interactions between mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobial bacteria and their legume hosts involves a common symbiosis signalling pathway. This signalling pathway is activated by Nod factors produced by rhizobia and these are recognised by the Nod factor receptors NFR1/LYK3 and NFR5/NFP. Mycorrhizal fungi produce lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) similar to Nod factors, as well as short-chain chitin oligomers (CO4/5), implying commonalities in signalling during mycorrhizal and rhizobial associations. Here we show that NFR1/LYK3, but not NFR5/NFP, is required for the establishment of the mycorrhizal interaction in legumes. NFR1/LYK3 is necessary for the recognition of mycorrhizal fungi and the activation of the symbiosis signalling pathway leading to induction of calcium oscillations and gene expression. Chitin oligosaccharides also act as microbe associated molecular patterns that promote plant immunity via similar LysM receptor-like kinases. CERK1 in rice has the highest homology to NFR1 and we show that this gene is also necessary for the establishment of the mycorrhizal interaction as well as for resistance to the rice blast fungus. Our results demonstrate that NFR1/LYK3/OsCERK1 represents a common receptor for chitooligosaccharide-based signals produced by mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobial bacteria (in legumes) and fungal pathogens. It would appear that mycorrhizal recognition has been conserved in multiple receptors across plant species, but additional diversification in certain plant species has defined other signals that this class of receptors can perceive.
25385701	XA23 is an executor R protein and confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	2014	Mol Plant	The majority of plant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that share common structural features. However, the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) associated executor type R genes show no considerable sequence homology to any known R genes. We adopted a map-based cloning approach and TALE-based technology to isolate and characterize Xa23, a new executor R gene derived from the wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that confers an extremely broad spectrum of resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Xa23 encodes a 113-amino acid protein that shares 50% identity to the known executor R protein XA10. The predicted transmembrane helices in XA23 also overlap with those of XA10. Unlike Xa10, however, Xa23 transcription is specifically activated by AvrXa23, a TALE present in all examined Xoo field isolates. Moreover, the susceptible xa23 allele has an identical open reading frame of Xa23, but differs in promoter region by lacking the TALE binding-element (EBE) for AvrXa23. XA23 can trigger strong hypersensitive response in rice, tobacco and tomato. Our results provide the first evidence that plant genomes have an executor R gene family in which members execute their function and spectrum of disease resistance by recognizing the cognate TALEs in pathogen.
25367203	A 90-day subchronic feeding study of genetically modified rice expressing Cry1Ab protein in Sprague-Dawley rats.	2015	Transgenic Res	Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic rice line (mfb-MH86) expressing a synthetic cry1Ab gene can be protected against feeding damage from Lepidopteran insects, including Sesamia inferens, Chilo suppressalis, Tryporyza incertulas and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis. Rice flour from mfb-MH86 and its near-isogenic control MH86 was separately formulated into rodent diets at concentrations of 17.5, 35 and 70 % (w/w) for a 90-day feeding test with rats, and all of the diets were nutritionally balanced. In this study, the responses of rats fed diets containing mfb-MH86 were compared to those of rats fed flour from MH86. Overall health, body weight and food consumption were comparable between groups fed diets containing mfb-MH86 and MH86. Blood samples were collected prior to sacrifice and a few significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in haematological and biochemical parameters between rats fed genetically modified (GM) and non-GM diets. However, the values of these parameters were within the normal ranges of values for rats of this age and sex, thus not considered treatment related. In addition, upon sacrifice a large number of organs were weighed, macroscopic and histopathological examinations were performed with only minor changes to report. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that no toxic effect was observed in the conditions of the experiment, based on the different parameters assessed. GM rice mfb-MH86 is as safe and nutritious as non-GM rice.
25367283	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) provide a useful tool to study defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. Although a number of LMMs have been identified in multiple species, most of the candidate genes are yet to be isolated. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) lesion mimic resembling (lmr) mutant, and cloning of the corresponding LMR gene. The LMR locus was initially delineated to 1.2 Mb region on chromosome 6, which was further narrowed down to 155-kb using insertions/deletions (INDELs) and cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence markers developed in this study. We sequenced the open reading frames predicted within the candidate genomic region, and identified a G-A base substitution causing a premature translation termination in a gene that encodes an ATPase associated with various cellular activities type (AAA-type) protein. RNA interference transgenic lines with reduced LMR transcripts exhibited the lesion mimic phenotype similar to that of lmr plants. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type LMR in the mutant background complemented the lesion phenotype, confirming that the mutation identified in LMR is responsible for the mutant phenotype. The pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PBZ1 and PR1 were induced in lmr, which also showed enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), suggesting LMR is a negative regulator of cell death in rice. The identification of lmr and cloning of the corresponding LMR gene provide an additional resource for the study of PCD in plants.
25393516	2'-Deoxymugineic acid promotes growth of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by orchestrating iron and nitrate uptake processes under high pH conditions.	2015	Plant J	Poaceae plants release 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) and related phytosiderophores to chelate iron (Fe), which often exists as insoluble Fe(III) in the rhizosphere, especially under high pH conditions. Although the molecular mechanisms behind the biosynthesis and secretion of DMA have been studied extensively, little information is known about whether DMA has biological roles other than chelating Fe in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that hydroponic cultures of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings show almost complete restoration in shoot height and soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) values after treatment with 3-30 μm DMA at high pH (pH 8.0), compared with untreated control seedlings at normal pH (pH 5.8). These changes were accompanied by selective accumulation of Fe over other metals. While this enhanced growth was evident under high pH conditions, DMA application also enhanced seedling growth under normal pH conditions in which Fe was fairly accessible. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that exogenous DMA application attenuated the increased expression levels of various genes related to Fe transport and accumulation. Surprisingly, despite the preferential utilization of ammonium over nitrate as a nitrogen source by rice, DMA application also increased nitrate reductase activity and the expression of genes encoding high-affinity nitrate transporters and nitrate reductases, all of which were otherwise considerably lower under high pH conditions. These data suggest that exogenous DMA not only plays an important role in facilitating the uptake of environmental Fe, but also orchestrates Fe and nitrate assimilation for optimal growth under high pH conditions.
25381289	Isolation of a novel lodging resistance QTL gene involved in strigolactone signaling and its pyramiding with a QTL gene involved in another mechanism.	2014	Mol Plant	Lodging has been a major roadblock to attaining increased crop productivity. In an attempt to understand the mechanism for culm strength in rice, we isolated an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL), STRONG CULM3 (SCM3), the causal gene of which is identical to rice TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (OsTB1), a gene previously reported to positively control strigolactone (SL) signaling. A near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying SCM3 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number despite the expected decrease in tiller number, indicating that SL also has a positive role in enhancing culm strength and spikelet number. We produced a pyramiding line carrying SCM3 and SCM2, another QTL encoding APO1 involved in panicle development. The NIL-SCM2+SCM3 showed a much stronger culm than NIL-SCM2 and NIL-SCM3 and an increased spikelet number caused by the additive effect of these QTLs. We discuss the importance of utilizing suitable alleles of these STRONG CULM QTLs without inducing detrimental traits for breeding.
25399020	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Plant leaf senescence and defence responses are important biological processes, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not well understood. This study identified a new rice mutant, spotted leaf 29 (spl29). The SPL29 gene was identified by map-based cloning, and SPL29 was confirmed as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) by enzymatic analysis. The mutant spl29 lacks UAP activity. The biological phenotypes for which UAP is responsible have not previously been reported in plants. The spl29 mutant displayed early leaf senescence, confirmed by chlorophyll loss and photosystem II decline as physiological indicators, chloroplast degradation as a cellular characteristic, and both upregulation of senescence transcription factors and senescence-associated genes, and downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes, as molecular evidence. Defence responses were induced in the spl29 mutant, shown by enhanced resistance to bacterial blight inoculation and upregulation of defence response genes. Reactive oxygen species, including O2 (-) and H2O2, accumulated in spl29 plants; there was also increased malondialdehyde content. Enhanced superoxide dismutase activity combined with normal catalase activity in spl29 could be responsible for H2O2 accumulation. The plant hormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid also accumulated in spl29 plants. ROS and plant hormones probably play important roles in early leaf senescence and defence responses in the spl29 mutant. Based on these findings, it is suggested that UAP1 is involved in regulating leaf senescence and defence responses in rice.
25392068	Multigene knockout utilizing off-target mutations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has been demonstrated to be a robust genome engineering tool in a variety of organisms including plants. However, it has been shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 system cleaves genomic DNA sequences containing mismatches to the guide RNA strand. We expected that this low specificity could be exploited to induce multihomeologous and multiparalogous gene knockouts. In the case of polyploid plants, simultaneous modification of multiple homeologous genes, i.e. genes with similar but not identical DNA sequences, is often needed to obtain a desired phenotype. Even in diploid plants, disruption of multiparalogous genes, which have functional redundancy, is often needed. To validate the applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target mutagenesis of paralogous genes in rice, we designed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that recognized 20 bp sequences of cyclin-dependent kinase B2 (CDKB2) as an on-target locus. These 20 bp possess similarity to other rice CDK genes (CDKA1, CDKA2 and CDKB1) with different numbers of mismatches. We analyzed mutations in these four CDK genes in plants regenerated from Cas9/sgRNA-transformed calli and revealed that single, double and triple mutants of CDKA2, CDKB1 and CDKB2 can be created by a single sgRNA.
25402171	Arabidopsis mTERF15 is required for mitochondrial nad2 intron 3 splicing and functional complex I activity.	2014	PLoS One	Mitochondria play a pivotal role in most eukaryotic cells, as they are responsible for the generation of energy and diverse metabolic intermediates for many cellular events. During endosymbiosis, approximately 99% of the genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome were transferred into the host nucleus, and mitochondria import more than 1000 nuclear-encoded proteins from the cytosol to maintain structural integrity and fundamental functions, including DNA replication, mRNA transcription and RNA metabolism of dozens of mitochondrial genes. In metazoans, a family of nuclear-encoded proteins called the mitochondrial transcription termination factors (mTERFs) regulates mitochondrial transcription, including transcriptional termination and initiation, via their DNA-binding activities, and the dysfunction of individual mTERF members causes severe developmental defects. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa contain 35 and 48 mTERFs, respectively, but the biological functions of only a few of these proteins have been explored. Here, we investigated the biological role and molecular mechanism of Arabidopsis mTERF15 in plant organelle metabolism using molecular genetics, cytological and biochemical approaches. The null homozygous T-DNA mutant of mTERF15, mterf15, was found to result in substantial retardation of both vegetative and reproductive development, which was fully complemented by the wild-type genomic sequence. Surprisingly, mitochondria-localized mTERF15 lacks obvious DNA-binding activity but processes mitochondrial nad2 intron 3 splicing through its RNA-binding ability. Impairment of this splicing event not only disrupted mitochondrial structure but also abolished the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. These effects are in agreement with the severe phenotype of the mterf15 homozygous mutant. Our study suggests that Arabidopsis mTERF15 functions as a splicing factor for nad2 intron 3 splicing in mitochondria, which is essential for normal plant growth and development.
25391545	Cloning and characterization of a multifunctional promoter from maize (Zea mays L.).	2015	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	The use of tissue-specific promoters to drive the expression of target genes during certain developmental stages or in specific organs can prevent unnecessary gene expression caused by constitutive promoters. Utilizing heterologous promoters to regulate the expression of genes in transgenic receptors can help prevent gene silencing. Here, we engineered heterologous maize promoters that regulate gene-specific expression in rice plant receptors. We performed a histochemical and quantitative β-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis of the Zea mays legumin1 (ZM-LEGF) gene promoter and detailed detection of stably transformed rice expressing the GUS gene under the control of the promoter of ZM-LEGF (pZM-LEGF) and its truncated promoters throughout development. When the promoter sequence was truncated, the location and intensity of GUS expression changed. The results suggest that the sequence from -140 to +41 is a critical region that confers the expression of the entire promoter. Truncation of pZM-LEG (3'-deleted region of pZM-LEGF) markedly increased the GUS activity, with the core cis-elements located in the -273 to -140 regions, namely pZM-LEG6. Detailed analysis of pZM-LEG6::GUS T2 transformant rice seeds and plant tissues at different developmental stages indicated that this promoter is an ideal vegetative tissue-specific promoter that can serve as a valuable tool for transgenic rice breeding and genetic engineering studies.
25534925	qEMF3, a novel QTL for the early-morning flowering trait from wild rice, Oryza officinalis, to mitigate heat stress damage at flowering in rice, O. sativa.	2015	J Exp Bot	A decline in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production caused by heat stress is one of the biggest concerns resulting from future climate change. Rice spikelets are most susceptible to heat stress at flowering. The early-morning flowering (EMF) trait mitigates heat-induced spikelet sterility at the flowering stage by escaping heat stress during the daytime. We attempted to develop near-isogenic lines (NILs) for EMF in the indica-type genetic background by exploiting the EMF locus from wild rice, O. officinalis (CC genome). A stable quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flower opening time (FOT) was detected on chromosome 3. A QTL was designated as qEMF3 and it shifted FOT by 1.5-2.0 h earlier for cv. Nanjing 11 in temperate Japan and cv. IR64 in the Philippine tropics. NILs for EMF mitigated heat-induced spikelet sterility under elevated temperature conditions completing flower opening before reaching 35°C, a general threshold value leading to spikelet sterility. Quantification of FOT of cultivars popular in the tropics and subtropics did not reveal the EMF trait in any of the cultivars tested, suggesting that qEMF3 has the potential to advance FOT of currently popular cultivars to escape heat stress at flowering under future hotter climates. This is the first report to examine rice with the EMF trait through marker-assisted breeding using wild rice as a genetic resource.
25492220	Genome re-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of a nutraceutical rice.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	The genomes of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare and 93-11, have been well studied. However, there is little available genetic information about nutraceutical rice cultivars. To remedy this situation, the present study aimed to provide a basic genetic landscape of nutraceutical rice. The genome of Black-1, a black pericarp rice containing higher levels of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and a more potent antioxidant capacity, was sequenced at ≥30 × coverage using Solexa sequencing technology. The complete sequences of Black-1 genome shared more consensus sequences with indica cultivar 93-11 than with Nipponbare. With reference to the 93-11 genome, Black-1 contained 675,207 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 43,130 insertions and deletions (1-5 bp), 1,770 copy number variations, and 10,911 presence/absence variations. These variations were observed to reside preferentially in Myb domains, NB-ARC domains and kinase domains, providing clues to the diversity of biological functions or secondary metabolisms in this cultivar. Intriguingly, 496 unique genes were identified by comparing it with the genomes of these two rice varieties; among the genes, 119 genes participate in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, several unique genes were predicted to be involved in the anthocyanins synthesis pathway. The genome-wide landscape of Black-1 uncovered by this study represents a valuable resource for further studies and for breeding nutraceutical rice varieties.
25522878	DNL1, encodes cellulose synthase-like D4, is a major QTL for plant height and leaf width in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	To better understand the genetic of rice agronomic traits, we selected two different rice germplasms in phenotypes, Xian80 and Suyunuo, to construct genetic population for QTL analysis. A total of 25 QTLs for six traits were found in a 175 F2 population. Major QTLs, qPH12,qLW12.2, qLL12 and qGW12.1, explaining 50.00%, 57.08%, 15.41% and 22.51% phenotypic variation for plant height, leaf width, leaf length and grain width, respectively, were located on the same interval of chromosome 12 flanking SSR markers RM519 and RM1103. In consideration of the great effects on plant height and leaf width, the locus was named DNL1 (Dwarf and Narrowed Leaf 1). Using a segregating population derived from F2 heterozygous individuals, a total of 1363 dwarfism and narrowed-leaf individuals was selected for screening recombinants. By high-resolution linkage analysis in 141 recombination events, DNL1 was narrowed to a 62.39kb region of InDel markers ID12M28 and HF43. The results of ORF analysis in target region and nucleotide sequence alignment indicated that DNL1 encodes cellulose synthase-like D4 protein, and a single nucleotide substitution (C2488T) in dnl1 result in decrease in plant height and leaf width. Bioinformatical analysis demonstrated that a conserved role for OsCSLD4 in the regulation of plant growth and development. Expression analysis for OsCSLDs showed OsCSLD4 highly expressed in roots, while other CSLD members had comparatively lower expression levels. However, no clear evidence about CSLD4/DNL1 expression was associated with its function.
25473841	ALT1, a Snf2 family chromatin remodeling ATPase, negatively regulates alkaline tolerance through enhanced defense against oxidative stress in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Alkaline salt stress adversely affects rice growth, productivity and grain quality. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. We characterized here an alkaline tolerant mutant, alt1 in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that alt1 harbors a mutation in a chromatin remodeling ATPase gene. ALT1-RNAi transgenic plants under different genetic background mimicked the alt1 phenotype, exhibiting tolerance to alkaline stress in a transcript dosage-dependent manner. The predicted ALT1 protein belonged to the Ris1 subgroup of the Snf2 family and was localized in the nucleus, and transcription of ALT1 was transiently suppressed after alkaline treatment. Although the absorption of several metal ions maintained well in the mutant under alkaline stress, expression level of the genes involved in metal ions homeostasis was not altered in the alt1 mutant. Classification of differentially expressed abiotic stress related genes, as revealed by microarray analysis, found that the majority (50/78) were involved in ROS production, ROS scavenging, and DNA repair. This finding was further confirmed by that alt1 exhibited lower levels of H2O2 under alkaline stress and tolerance to methyl viologen treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that ALT1 negatively functions in alkaline tolerance mainly through the defense against oxidative damage, and provide a potential two-step strategy for improving the tolerance of rice plants to alkaline stress.
25517485	Genome-wide screening and functional analysis identify a large number of long noncoding RNAs involved in the sexual reproduction of rice.	2014	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a wide range of biological processes in mammals and plants. However, the systematic examination of lncRNAs in plants lags behind that in mammals. Recently, lncRNAs have been identified in Arabidopsis and wheat; however, no systematic screening of potential lncRNAs has been reported for the rice genome.

RESULTS: In this study, we perform whole transcriptome strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) of samples from rice anthers, pistils, and seeds 5 days after pollination and from shoots 14 days after germination. Using these data, together with 40 available rice RNA-seq datasets, we systematically analyze rice lncRNAs and definitively identify lncRNAs that are involved in the reproductive process. The results show that rice lncRNAs have some different characteristics compared to those of Arabidopsis and mammals and are expressed in a highly tissue-specific or stage-specific manner. We further verify the functions of a set of lncRNAs that are preferentially expressed in reproductive stages and identify several lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which sequester miR160 or miR164 in a type of target mimicry. More importantly, one lncRNA, XLOC_057324, is demonstrated to play a role in panicle development and fertility. We also develop a source of rice lncRNA-associated insertional mutants.

CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide screening and functional analysis enabled the identification of a set of lncRNAs that are involved in the sexual reproduction of rice. The results also provide a source of lncRNAs and associated insertional mutants in rice.
25482754	Effect of air desiccation and salt stress factors on in vitro regeneration of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Enhancement of callus induction and its regeneration efficiency through in vitro techniques has been optimized for 2 abiotic stresses (salt and air desiccation) using 3 rice genotypes viz. BR10, BRRI dhan32 and BRRI dhan47. The highest frequency of callus induction was obtained for BRRI dhan32 (64.44%) in MS medium supplemented with 2, 4-D (2.5 mgL(-1)) and Kin (1.0 mgL(-1)). Different concentrations of NaCl (2.9, 5.9, 8.8 and 11.7 gL(-1)) were used and its effect was recorded on the basis of viability of calli (VC), relative growth rate (RGR), tolerance index (TI) and relative water content (RWC). It was observed that in all cases BRRI dhan47 showed highest performance on tolerance to VC (45.33%), RGR (1.03%), TI (0.20%) and RWC (10.23%) with 11.7 gL(-1) NaCl. Plant regeneration capability was recorded after partial air desiccation pretreatment to calli for 15, 30, 45 and 60 h. In this case BRRI dhan32 gave maximum number of regeneration (76.19%) when 4 weeks old calli were desiccated for 45 h. It was observed that air desiccation was 2-3 folds more effective for enhancing green plantlet regeneration compared to controls. Furthermore, desiccated calli also showed the better capability to survive in NaCl induced abiotic stress; and gave 1.9 fold (88.80%) increased regeneration in 11.7 gL(-1) salt level for BRRI dhan47. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the genotypes, air desiccation and NaCl had significant effect on plant regeneration at P < 0.01.
25432789	Overexpression of folate biosynthesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and evaluation of their impact on seed folate content.	2014	Plant Foods Hum Nutr	Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency is a global health problem especially in developing countries where the major staple foods such as rice contain extremely low folates. Biofortification of rice could be an alternative complement way to fight folate deficiency. In this study, we evaluated the availability of the genes in each step of folate biosynthesis pathway for rice folate enhancement in the japonica variety kitaake genetic background. The first enzymes GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) and aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) in the pterin and para-aminobenzoate branches resulted in significant increase in seed folate content, respectively (P < 0.01). Overexpression of two closely related enzymes dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS) and folypolyglutamate synthase (FPGS), which perform the first and further additions of glutamates, produced slightly increase in seed folate content separately. The GTPCHI transgene was combined with each of the other transgenes except ADCS to investigate the effects of gene stacking on seed folate accumulation. Seed folate contents in the gene-stacked plants were higher than the individual low-folate transgenic parents, but lower than the high-folate GTPCHI transgenic lines, pointing to an inadequate supply of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) precursor initiated by ADCS in constraining folate overproduction in gene-stacked plants.
25270163	The roles of histone acetylation in seed performance and plant development.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Histone acetylation regulates gene transcription by chromatin modifications and plays a crucial role in the plant development and response to environment cues. The homeostasis of histone acetylation is controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in different plant tissues and development stages. The vigorous knowledge of the function and co-factors about HATs (e.g. GCN5) and HDACs (e.g. HDA19, HDA6) has been obtained from model plant Arabidopsis. However, understanding individual role of other HATs and HDACs require more work, especially in the major food crops such as rice, maize and wheat. Many co-regulators have been recently identified to function as a component of HAT or HDAC complex in some specific developmental processes. The described findings show a distinctive and interesting epigenetic regulation network composed of HATs, HDACs and co-regulators playing crucial roles in the seed performance, flowering time, plant morphogenesis, plant response to stresses etc. In this review, we summarized the recent progresses and suggested the perspective of histone acetylation research, which might provide us a new window to understand the epigenetic code of plant development and to improve the crop production and quality.
25243048	Genetic interaction between rice PLASTOCHRON genes and the gibberellin pathway in leaf development.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice PLASTOCHRON (PLA) genes PLA1 and PLA2 regulate leaf maturation and the temporal pattern of leaf initiation. Although the function of PLA genes in the leaf initiation process has been analyzed, little is known about how they affect leaf growth. Previously, we suggested that PLA1 and PLA2 function downstream of the gibberellin (GA) signal transduction pathway. In the present study, we examined the phenotype of a double mutant of pla and slender rice 1 (slr1), which is a constitutive GA response mutant. By analyzing these double mutants, we discuss the relationship between PLA-related and GA-dependent pathways and the possible function of PLA genes in leaf growth.

FINDINGS: Single slr1 and pla mutants exhibited elongated and dwarf phenotypes in the vegetative stage, respectively. The stature and leaf size of the pla1/slr1 and pla2/slr1 double mutants were intermediate between those of the pla and slr1 single mutants. However, the effects of slr1 on leaf elongation were markedly suppressed in the pla1 and pla2 mutant backgrounds. On the other hand, the change in cell length in the double mutants was almost the same as that in the single mutants. An expression analysis of genes involved in GA biosynthesis and catabolism indicated that feedback regulation functioned normally in the pla/slr1 double mutants.

CONCLUSIONS: Our genetic results confirm that PLA genes regulate leaf growth downstream of the GA pathway. Our findings also suggest that PLA1 and PLA2 are partly required for GA-dependent leaf elongation, mainly by affecting cellular proliferation.
25231250	Improved oxidative tolerance in suspension-cultured cells of C4-pepctransgenic rice by H2O2 and Ca(2+) under PEG-6000.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	To understand the molecular responses of PC (Overexpressing the maize C4-pepc gene, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)), to drought stress at cell level, we analyzed changes in the levels of signaling molecules (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), calcium ion (Ca(2+)), and nitric oxide (NO)) in suspension-cultured PC and wild-type (WT) rice (Oryza sativa L.) cell under drought stress induced by 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000). Results demonstrated that PC improved drought tolerance by enhancing antioxidant defense, retaining higher relative water content, survival percentages, and dry weight of cells. In addition, PEPC activity in PC under PEG treatment was strengthened by addition of H2O2 inhibitor, dimethylthiourea (DMTU) and NO synthesis inhibitor, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), respectively, while that in PC was weakened by addition of free calcium chelator, ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) + calcium channel outflow inhibitor, ruthenium red (RR) + plasma membrane channel blocker La(NO3)3, but EGTA + RR did not. Results also showed that NO and Ca(2+) was lying downstream of H2O2 in drought-induced signaling. Calcium ion was also involved in the expression of C4-pepc in PC. These results suggested that PC could improve oxidative tolerance in suspension-cultured cells and the acquisition of this tolerance required downregulation of H2O2 and the entry of extracellular Ca(2+) into cells across the plasma membrane for regulation of PEPC activity and C4-pepc expression.
25059749	Gas chromatography mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling reveals biomarkers involved in rice-gall midge interactions.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	The Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae Wood-Mason) is a serious pest of rice that causes huge loss in yield. While feeding inside the susceptible host, maggots secrete substances that facilitate the formation of a hollow tube-like structure called gall and prevent panicle formation. The present investigation was carried out to get an account of biochemical changes occurring in the rice plant upon gall midge feeding. Metabolic profiling of host tissues from three rice varieties, namely, TN1, Kavya, and RP2068, exposed to gall midge biotype 1 (GMB1), was carried out using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). TN1 and GMB1 represented compatible interaction, while Kavya and GMB1 as well as RP2068 and GMB1 represented incompatible interactions. The current study identified several metabolites that could be grouped as resistance, susceptibility, infestation, and host features based on their relative abundance. These may be regarded as biomarkers for insect-plant interaction in general and rice-gall midge interaction in particular.
25342550	Production of superoxide from Photosystem II in a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant lacking PsbS.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: PsbS is a 22-kDa Photosystem (PS) II protein involved in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two PsbS genes, PsbS1 and PsbS2. However, only inactivation of PsbS1, through a knockout (PsbS1-KO) or in RNAi transgenic plants, results in plants deficient in qE, the energy-dependent component of NPQ.

RESULTS: In studies presented here, under fluctuating high light, growth of young seedlings lacking PsbS is retarded, and PSII in detached leaves of the mutants is more sensitive to photoinhibitory illumination compared with the wild type. Using both histochemical and fluorescent probes, we determined the levels of reactive oxygen species, including singlet oxygen, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, in leaves and thylakoids. The PsbS-deficient plants generated more superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in their chloroplasts. PSII complexes isolated from them produced more superoxide compared with the wild type, and PSII-driven superoxide production was higher in the mutants. However, we could not observe such differences either in isolated PSI complexes or through PSI-driven electron transport. Time-course experiments using isolated thylakoids showed that superoxide production was the initial event, and that production of hydrogen peroxide proceeded from that.

CONCLUSION: These results indicate that at least some of the photoprotection provided by PsbS and qE is mediated by preventing production of superoxide released from PSII under conditions of excess excitation energy.
25281725	Physiological basis of tolerance to complete submergence in rice involves genetic factors in addition to the SUB1 gene.	2014	AoB Plants	Recurring floods in Asia cause poor crop establishment. Yields decline drastically when plants are completely submerged for a few days. Traditional rice cultivars predominate because they have acquired moderate tolerance to flooding but they carry the penalty of inherently lower grain yields. In contrast, modern high-yielding varieties are highly susceptible to flooding. Cultivars with tolerance to complete submergence were recently developed in the background of popular varieties by transferring the submergence tolerance gene SUBMERGENCE1 (SUB1) from the highly tolerant Indian landrace FR13A. The present study evaluated three pairs of Sub1 near-isogenic lines (NILs) together with FR13A and two of its submergence-tolerant derivatives under field conditions to assess the survival and growth processes occurring during submergence and recovery that are associated with SUB1. Under control conditions, the NILs showed similar growth and biomass accumulation, indicating that SUB1 had no apparent effects. Submergence substantially decreased biomass accumulation but with greater reduction in the genotypes lacking SUB1, particularly when submergence was prolonged for 17 days. When submerged, the lines lacking SUB1 showed greater elongation and lower or negative biomass accumulation. Sub1 lines maintained higher chlorophyll concentrations during submergence and lost less non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) after submergence. This indicates that the introgression of SUB1 resulted in better regulation of NSC during submergence and that high pre-submergence NSC is not essential for the submergence tolerance conferred by SUB1. During recovery, chlorophyll degradation was faster in genotypes lacking SUB1 and any surviving plants showed poorer and delayed emergence of tillers and leaves. Sub1 lines restored new leaf and tiller production faster. During submergence, FR13A showed not only slower leaf elongation but also accumulated extra biomass and was able to recover faster than Sub1 lines. This suggests the possibility of further improvements in submergence tolerance by incorporating additional traits present in FR13A or other similar landraces.
25358745	Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.	2014	Nat Commun	Plants capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis, which is the primary component of crop yield, and needs to be increased considerably to meet the growing global demand for food. Environmental stresses, which are increasing with climate change, adversely affect photosynthetic carbon metabolism (PCM) and limit yield of cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) that feeds half the world. To study the regulation of photosynthesis, we developed a rice gene regulatory network and identified a transcription factor HYR (HIGHER YIELD RICE) associated with PCM, which on expression in rice enhances photosynthesis under multiple environmental conditions, determining a morpho-physiological programme leading to higher grain yield under normal, drought and high-temperature stress conditions. We show HYR is a master regulator, directly activating photosynthesis genes, cascades of transcription factors and other downstream genes involved in PCM and yield stability under drought and high-temperature environmental stress conditions.
25330210	Inspection of the grapevine BURP superfamily highlights an expansion of RD22 genes with distinctive expression features in berry development and ABA-mediated stress responses.	2014	PLoS One	The RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 22 (RD22) gene is a molecular link between abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and abiotic stress responses. Its expression has been used as a reliable ABA early response marker. In Arabidopsis, the single copy RD22 gene possesses a BURP domain also located at the C-terminus of USP embryonic proteins and the beta subunit of polygalacturonases. In grapevine, a RD22 gene has been identified but putative paralogs are also found in the grape genome, possibly forming a large RD22 family in this species. In this work, we searched for annotations containing BURP domains in the Vitis vinifera genome. Nineteen proteins were defined by a comparative analysis between the two genome predictions and RNA-Seq data. These sequences were compared to other plant BURPs identified in previous genome surveys allowing us to reconceive group classifications based on phylogenetic relationships and protein motif occurrence. We observed a lineage-specific evolution of the RD22 family, with the biggest expansion in grapevine and poplar. In contrast, rice, sorghum and maize presented highly expanded monocot-specific groups. The Vitis RD22 group may have expanded from segmental duplications as most of its members are confined to a region in chromosome 4. The inspection of transcriptomic data revealed variable expression of BURP genes in vegetative and reproductive organs. Many genes were induced in specific tissues or by abiotic and biotic stresses. Three RD22 genes were further studied showing that they responded oppositely to ABA and to stress conditions. Our results show that the inclusion of RNA-Seq data is essential while describing gene families and improving gene annotations. Robust phylogenetic analyses including all BURP members from other sequenced species helped us redefine previous relationships that were erroneously established. This work provides additional evidence for RD22 genes serving as marker genes for different organs or stresses in grapevine.
25435546	Plant-PrAS: a database of physicochemical and structural properties and novel functional regions in plant proteomes.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model species for studies of plant gene functions. Research on Arabidopsis has resulted in the generation of high-quality genome sequences, annotations and related post-genomic studies. The amount of annotation, such as gene-coding regions and structures, is steadily growing in the field of plant research. In contrast to the genomics resource of animals and microorganisms, there are still some difficulties with characterization of some gene functions in plant genomics studies. The acquisition of information on protein structure can help elucidate the corresponding gene function because proteins encoded in the genome possess highly specific structures and functions. In this study, we calculated multiple physicochemical and secondary structural parameters of protein sequences, including length, hydrophobicity, the amount of secondary structure, the number of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and the predicted presence of transmembrane helices and signal peptides, using a total of 208,333 protein sequences from the genomes of six representative plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Oryza sativa (rice), Physcomitrella patens (moss) and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (alga). Using the PASS tool and the Rosetta Stone method, we annotated the presence of novel functional regions in 1,732 protein sequences that included unannotated sequences from the Arabidopsis and rice proteomes. These results were organized into the Plant Protein Annotation Suite database (Plant-PrAS), which can be freely accessed online at http://plant-pras.riken.jp/.
25417716	MicroRNA biogenesis factor DRB1 is a phosphorylation target of mitogen activated protein kinase MPK3 in both rice and Arabidopsis.	2015	FEBS J	MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis requires AtDRB1 (double-stranded RNA binding protein)/HYL1 (Hyponastic Leaves1) protein for processing and maturation of miRNA precursors. The AtDRB1/HYL1 protein associates with AtDCL1 (Dicer-Like1) and accurately processes primary-miRNAs (pri-mRNAs) first to precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and finally to mature miRNAs. The dephosphorylation of AtDRB1/HYL1 protein is very important for the precise processing of miRNA precursors. The monocot model crop plant Oryza sativa encodes four orthologues of AtDRB1/HYL1 protein, the only one encoded by Arabidopsis thaliana. The present study focuses on the functionality of the O. sativa DRBs as the orthologues of AtDRB1/HYL1 by using RNA binding assays and in planta protein-protein interaction analysis. Further, mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK3 is established as the kinase phosphorylating DRB1 protein in both the model plants, O. sativa and Arabidopsis. MicroRNA microarray analysis in atmpk3 and atmpk6 mutants indicate the importance of AtMPK3 in maintaining the level of miRNAs in the plant.
25506347	A novel conserved mechanism for plant NLR protein pairs: the "integrated decoy" hypothesis.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Plant immunity is often triggered by the specific recognition of pathogen effectors by intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLR). Plant NLRs contain an N-terminal signaling domain that is mostly represented by either a Toll-interleukin1 receptor (TIR) domain or a coiled coil (CC) domain. In many cases, single NLR proteins are sufficient for both effector recognition and signaling activation. However, many paired NLRs have now been identified where both proteins are required to confer resistance to pathogens. Recent detailed studies on the Arabidopsis thaliana TIR-NLR pair RRS1 and RPS4 and on the rice CC-NLR pair RGA4 and RGA5 have revealed for the first time how such protein pairs function together. In both cases, the paired partners interact physically to form a hetero-complex receptor in which each partner plays distinct roles in effector recognition or signaling activation, highlighting a conserved mode of action of NLR pairs across both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. We also describe an "integrated decoy" model for the function of these receptor complexes. In this model, a plant protein targeted by an effector has been duplicated and fused to one member of the NLR pair, where it acts as a bait to trigger defense signaling by the second NLR upon effector binding. This mechanism may be common to many other plant NLR pairs.
25531538	Molecular phylogenetic study and expression analysis of ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in Oryza sativa in response to salt stress.	2015	Comput Biol Chem	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is a large gene superfamily that utilizes the energy released from ATP hydrolysis for transporting myriad of substrates across the biological membranes. Although many investigations have been done on the structural and functional analysis of the ABC transporters in Oryza sativa, much less is known about molecular phylogenetic and global expression pattern of the complete ABC family in rice. In this study, we have carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis constructing neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees based on various statistical methods of different ABC protein subfamily of five plant lineages including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae), Physcomitrella patens (moss), Selaginella moellendorffii (lycophyte), Arabidopsis thaliana (dicot) and O. sativa (monocot) to explore the origin and evolutionary patterns of these ABC genes. We have identified several conserved motifs in nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of ABC proteins among all plant lineages during evolution. Amongst the different ABC protein subfamilies, 'ABCE' has not yet been identified in lower plant genomes (algae, moss and lycophytes). The result indicated that gene duplication and diversification process acted upon these genes as a major operative force creating new groups and subgroups and functional divergence during evolution. We have demonstrated that rice ABCI subfamily consists of only half size transporters that represented highly dynamic members showing maximum sequence variations among the other rice ABC subfamilies. The evolutionary and the expression analysis contribute to a deep insight into the evolution and diversity of rice ABC proteins and their roles in response to salt stress that facilitate our further understanding on rice ABC transporters.
25435547	MPIC: a mitochondrial protein import components database for plant and non-plant species.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	In the 2 billion years since the endosymbiotic event that gave rise to mitochondria, variations in mitochondrial protein import have evolved across different species. With the genomes of an increasing number of plant species sequenced, it is possible to gain novel insights into mitochondrial protein import pathways. We have generated the Mitochondrial Protein Import Components (MPIC) Database (DB; http://www.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/applications/mpic) providing searchable information on the protein import apparatus of plant and non-plant mitochondria. An in silico analysis was carried out, comparing the mitochondrial protein import apparatus from 24 species representing various lineages from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and algae to Homo sapiens (human) and higher plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Oryza sativa (rice) and other more recently sequenced plant species. Each of these species was extensively searched and manually assembled for analysis in the MPIC DB. The database presents an interactive diagram in a user-friendly manner, allowing users to select their import component of interest. The MPIC DB presents an extensive resource facilitating detailed investigation of the mitochondrial protein import machinery and allowing patterns of conservation and divergence to be recognized that would otherwise have been missed. To demonstrate the usefulness of the MPIC DB, we present a comparative analysis of the mitochondrial protein import machinery in plants and non-plant species, revealing plant-specific features that have evolved.
25416794	Higher sterol content regulated by CYP51 with concomitant lower phospholipid content in membranes is a common strategy for aluminium tolerance in several plant species.	2015	J Exp Bot	Several studies have shown that differences in lipid composition and in the lipid biosynthetic pathway affect the aluminium (Al) tolerance of plants, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. Phospholipids create a negative charge at the surface of the plasma membrane and enhance Al sensitivity as a result of the accumulation of positively charged Al(3+) ions. The phospholipids will be balanced by other electrically neutral lipids, such as sterols. In the present research, Al tolerance was compared among pea (Pisum sativum) genotypes. Compared with Al-tolerant genotypes, the Al-sensitive genotype accumulated more Al in the root tip, had a less intact plasma membrane, and showed a lower expression level of PsCYP51, which encodes obtusifoliol-14α-demethylase (OBT 14DM), a key sterol biosynthetic enzyme. The ratio of phospholipids to sterols was higher in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant genotypes, suggesting that the sterol biosynthetic pathway plays an important role in Al tolerance. Consistent with this idea, a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana line with knocked-down AtCYP51 expression showed an Al-sensitive phenotype. Uniconazole-P, an inhibitor of OBT 14DM, suppressed the Al tolerance of Al-tolerant genotypes of maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and triticale (×Triticosecale Wittmark cv. Currency). These results suggest that increased sterol content, regulated by CYP51, with concomitant lower phospholipid content in the root tip, results in lower negativity of the plasma membrane. This appears to be a common strategy for Al tolerance among several plant species.
25429427	Proteomic analysis of rice nonhost resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici using two-dimensional electrophoresis.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the only widely cultivated gramineous crops that cannot be infected by rust fungi. To decipher the molecular basis of rice nonhost resistance (NHR) to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, proteomic analysis was performed using the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique. The expressed proteins from rice leaves 24 and 48 h post inoculation with Pst and from mock-inoculated leaves were identified. Quantitative analysis revealed a total of 27 differentially expressed proteins in response to Pst inoculation. Most of these proteins fall into the category "response to stimulus" and are involved in basic resistance processes, such as glycerol-3-phosphate and hydrogen peroxide signaling. A homologue of wheat leaf rust resistance protein Lr10 was also identified, implicating multiple layers of plant defense are implicated in rice NHR to Pst. These results demonstrate an intrinsic relationship between host and nonhost resistance. Changes in abundance of these proteins, together with their putative functions reveal a comprehensive profile of rice NHR to Pst and provide new insights into plant immunity.
25420550	Ancient horizontal transfer of transaldolase-like protein gene and its role in plant vascular development.	2015	New Phytol	A major event in land plant evolution is the origin of vascular tissues, which ensure the long-distance transport of water, nutrients and organic compounds. However, the molecular basis for the origin and evolution of plant vascular tissues remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the evolution of the land plant TAL-type transaldolase (TAL) gene and its potential function in rice (Oryza sativa) based on phylogenetic analyses and transgenic experiments, respectively. TAL genes are only present in land plants and bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that land plant TAL genes are derived from Actinobacteria through an ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event. Further evidence reveals that land plant TAL genes have undergone positive selection and gained several introns following its acquisition by the most recent common ancestor of land plants. Transgenic plant experiments show that rice TAL is specifically expressed in vascular tissues and that knockdown of TAL expression leads to changes in both the number and pattern of vascular bundles. Our findings show that the ancient HGT of TAL from bacteria probably plays an important role in plant vascular development and adaptation to land environments.
25501185	Identification of quantitative trait loci conferring blast resistance in Bodao, a japonica rice landrace.	2014	Genet Mol Res	Bodao, a japonica landrace from the Taihu Lake region of China, is highly resistant to most Chinese isolates of Magnaporthe oryzea, a form of rice blast. To effectively dissect the influence of genetics on this blast resistance, a population of 155 recombinant inbred lines (F2:8) derived from a cross of Bodao x Suyunuo was inoculated with 12 blast isolates. Using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, 13 QTL on chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 11, and 12 were detected from Bodao. Five QTL, including qtl11-1-1, qtl11-3-7, qtl11-4-9, qtl12-1-1, and qtl12-2-3, have not been previously reported. The qtl11-3-7 and qtl11-4-9 may be the two main effective QTL and resistant to 7 and 9 isolates, respectively. The results of the present study will be valuable for the fine mapping and cloning of these two new resistance genes.
25431424	Casein kinases I and 2α phosphorylate oryza sativa pseudo-response regulator 37 (OsPRR37) in photoperiodic flowering in rice.	2015	Mol Cells	Flowering time (or heading date) is controlled by intrinsic genetic programs in response to environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature. Rice, a facultative short-day (SD) plant, flowers early in SD and late in long-day (LD) conditions. Casein kinases (CKs) generally act as positive regulators in many signaling pathways in plants. In rice, Heading date 6 (Hd6) and Hd16 encode CK2α and CKI, respectively, and mainly function to delay flowering time. Additionally, the major LD-dependent floral repressors Hd2/Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) and Ghd7 also confer strong photoperiod sensitivity. In floral induction, Hd16 acts upstream of Ghd7 and CKI interacts with and phosphorylates Ghd7. In addition, Hd6 and Hd16 also act upstream of Hd2. However, whether CKI and CK2α directly regulate the function of PRR37 remains unclear. Here, we use in vitro pull-down and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to show that CKI and CK2α interact with PRR37. We further use in vitro kinase assays to show that CKI and CK2α phosphorylate different regions of PRR37. Our results indicate that direct posttranslational modification of PRR37 mediates the genetic interactions between these two protein kinases and PRR37. The significance of CK-mediated phosphorylation for PRR37 and Ghd7 function is discussed.
25501189	Selection of optimized candidate reference genes for qRT-PCR normalization in rice (Oryza sativa L.) during Magnaporthe oryzae infection and drought.	2014	Genet Mol Res	Drought and rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae are two of the most serious threats to global rice production. To explore the mechanisms underlying gene expression induced in rice by stresses, studies involving transcriptome analyses have been conducted over the past few years. Thus, it is crucial to have a reliable set of reference genes to normalize the expression levels of rice genes affected by different stresses. To identify potential reference genes for studies of the differential expression of target genes in rice under M. oryzae infection and drought conditions, the present study evaluated five housekeeping genes for the normalization of gene expression. The stability of the expression of these genes was assessed using the analytical software packages geNorm and NormFinder. For all samples analyzed, the stability rank was UBQ5 > GAPDH > eIF-4α> β-TUB > 18S rRNA. The data showed that the UBQ5, GAPDH, and eIF-4αgenes are appropriate, high-performing reference genes and will be highly useful in future expression studies of fungal infections and drought in rice.
25413289	Exogenous application of calcium and silica alleviates cadmium toxicity by suppressing oxidative damage in rice seedlings.	2015	Protoplasma	The present study was undertaken to examine the possible roles of calcium (Ca(2+)) and silica (Si) in protection against oxidative damage due to Cd(2+) toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings grown in hydroponics. Rice seedlings raised for 12 days in hydroponics containing Cd(NO3)2 (75 μM) showed reduced growth; increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (O2 (·-) and H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and protein carbonylation; and increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) compared to untreated controls. Exogenously added Ca(2+) (2 mM) and Si (200 μM) significantly alleviated negative effect of Cd(2+) by restoration of growth of the seedlings, suppression of Cd(2+) uptake and restoration of root plasma membrane integrity. The levels of O2 (·-), H2O2, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls were much lower when Ca(2+) and Si were added in the growth medium along with Cd(2+) as compared to Cd-alone-treated seedlings. Ca(2+) and Si lowered Cd-induced increase in SOD, GPX and APX activities while they elevated Cd-induced decline in CAT activity. Using histochemical staining of O2 (·-) and H2O2 in leaf tissues, it was further confirmed that added Ca(2+) and Si suppressed Cd-induced accumulation of O2 (·-) and H2O2 in the leaves. The results suggest that exogenous application of Ca(2+) and Si appears to be advantageous for rice plants in alleviating Cd(2+) toxicity effects by reducing Cd(2+) uptake, decreasing ROS production and suppressing oxidative damage. The observations indicate that Ca(2+) and Si treatments can help in reducing Cd(2+) toxicity in rice plants.
25418692	GID1 modulates stomatal response and submergence tolerance involving abscisic acid and gibberellic acid signaling in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Plant responses to abiotic stresses are coordinated by arrays of growth and developmental programs. Gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play critical roles in the developmental programs and environmental responses, respectively, through complex signaling and metabolism networks. However, crosstalk between the two phytohormones in stress responses remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1), a soluble receptor for GA, regulates stomatal development and patterning in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The gid1 mutant showed impaired biosynthesis of endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions, but it exhibited enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA. Scanning electron microscope and infrared thermal image analysis indicated an increase in the stomatal conductance in the gid1 mutant under drought conditions. Interestingly, the gid1 mutant had increased levels of chlorophyll and carbohydrates under submergence conditions, and showed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability and submergence tolerance compared with the wild-type. Further analyses suggested that the function of GID1 in submergence responses is partially dependent on ABA, and GA signaling by GID1 is involved in submergence tolerance by modulating carbohydrate consumption. Taken together, these findings suggest GID1 plays distinct roles in stomatal response and submergence tolerance through both the ABA and GA signaling pathways in rice.
25319482	Infection of Ustilaginoidea virens intercepts rice seed formation but activates grain-filling-related genes.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice false smut has become an increasingly serious disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production worldwide. The typical feature of this disease is that the fungal pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens (Uv) specifically infects rice flower and forms false smut ball, the ustiloxin-containing ball-like fungal colony, of which the size is usually several times larger than that of a mature rice seed. However, the underlying mechanisms of Uv-rice interaction are poorly understood. Here, we applied time-course microscopic and transcriptional approaches to investigate rice responses to Uv infection. The results demonstrated that the flower-opening process and expression of associated transcription factors, including ARF6 and ARF8, were inhibited in Uv-infected spikelets. The ovaries in infected spikelets were interrupted in fertilization and thus were unable to set seeds. However, a number of grain-filling-related genes, including seed storage protein genes, starch anabolism genes and endosperm-specific transcription factors (RISBZ1 and RPBF), were highly transcribed as if the ovaries were fertilized. In addition, critical defense-related genes like NPR1 and PR1 were downregulated by Uv infection. Our data imply that Uv may hijack host nutrient reservoir by activation of the grain-filling network because of growth and formation of false smut balls.
25330236	Ethylene-induced inhibition of root growth requires abscisic acid function in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2014	PLoS Genet	Ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) have a complicated interplay in many developmental processes. Their interaction in rice is largely unclear. Here, we characterized a rice ethylene-response mutant mhz4, which exhibited reduced ethylene-response in roots but enhanced ethylene-response in coleoptiles of etiolated seedlings. MHZ4 was identified through map-based cloning and encoded a chloroplast-localized membrane protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) ABA4, which is responsible for a branch of ABA biosynthesis. MHZ4 mutation reduced ABA level, but promoted ethylene production. Ethylene induced MHZ4 expression and promoted ABA accumulation in roots. MHZ4 overexpression resulted in enhanced and reduced ethylene response in roots and coleoptiles, respectively. In root, MHZ4-dependent ABA pathway acts at or downstream of ethylene receptors and positively regulates root ethylene response. This ethylene-ABA interaction mode is different from that reported in Arabidopsis, where ethylene-mediated root inhibition is independent of ABA function. In coleoptile, MHZ4-dependent ABA pathway acts at or upstream of OsEIN2 to negatively regulate coleoptile ethylene response, possibly by affecting OsEIN2 expression. At mature stage, mhz4 mutation affects branching and adventitious root formation on stem nodes of higher positions, as well as yield-related traits. Together, our findings reveal a novel mode of interplay between ethylene and ABA in control of rice growth and development.
25280352	Mutation of the rice ASL2 gene encoding plastid ribosomal protein L21 causes chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death.	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	The plastid ribosome proteins (PRPs) play important roles in plastid protein biosynthesis, chloroplast differentiation and early chloroplast development. However, the specialised functions of individual protein components of the chloroplast ribosome in rice (Oryza sativa) remain unresolved. In this paper, we identified a novel rice PRP mutant named asl2 (Albino seedling lethality 2) exhibiting an albino, seedling death phenotype. In asl2 mutants, the alteration of leaf colour was associated with chlorophyll (Chl) content and abnormal chloroplast development. Through map-based cloning and complementation, the mutated ASL2 gene was isolated and found to encode the chloroplast 50S ribosome protein L21 (RPL21c), a component of the chloroplast ribosome large subunit, which was localised in chloroplasts. ASL2 was expressed at a higher level in the plumule and leaves, implying its tissue-specific expression. Additionally, the expression of ASL2 was regulated by light. The transcript levels of the majority of genes for Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl2 mutants. Collectively, the absence of functional ASL2 caused chloroplast developmental defects and seedling death. This report establishes the important role of RPL21c in chloroplast development in rice.
25307286	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Plant architecture directly affects biomass in higher plants, especially grain yields in agricultural crops. In this study, we characterized a recessive mutant, plant architecture determinant (pad), derived from the Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivar MH86. The mutant exhibited severe dwarf phenotypes, including shorter and stunted leaves, fewer secondary branches during both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Cytological studies revealed that pad mutant growth defects are primarily due to the inhibition of cell expansion. The PAD gene was isolated using a map-based cloning strategy. It encodes a plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 and a SNP responsible for a single amino acid change was found in the mutant. PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the most of the genes responding to gibberellin (GA) metabolism were up-regulated in pad mutant internodes. The endogenous GA content measurement revealed that the levels of GA1 were significantly decreased in the third internode of pad mutants. Moreover, a GA response assay suggested that OsMCA1/PAD might be involved in the regulation of GA metabolism and signal transduction. Our results revealed the pad is a loss-of-function mutant of the OsMCA1/PAD, leading to upregulation of genes related to GA deactivation, which decreased bioactive GA levels.
25324853	Large scale germplasm screening for identification of novel rice blast resistance sources.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Rice is a major cereal crop that contributes significantly to global food security. Biotic stresses, including the rice blast fungus, cause severe yield losses that significantly impair rice production worldwide. The rapid genetic evolution of the fungus often overcomes the resistance conferred by major genes after a few years of intensive agricultural use. Therefore, resistance breeding requires continuous efforts of enriching the reservoir of resistance genes/alleles to effectively tackle the disease. Seed banks represent a rich stock of genetic diversity, however, they are still under-explored for identifying novel genes and/or their functional alleles. We conducted a large-scale screen for new rice blast resistance sources in 4246 geographically diverse rice accessions originating from 13 major rice-growing countries. The accessions were selected from a total collection of over 120,000 accessions based on their annotated rice blast resistance information in the International Rice Genebank. A two-step resistance screening protocol was used involving natural infection in a rice uniform blast nursery and subsequent artificial infections with five single rice blast isolates. The nursery-resistant accessions showed varied disease responses when infected with single isolates, suggesting the presence of diverse resistance genes/alleles in this accession collection. In addition, 289 accessions showed broad-spectrum resistance against all five single rice blast isolates. The selected resistant accessions were genotyped for the presence of the Pi2 resistance gene, thereby identifying potential accessions for isolation of allelic variants of this blast resistance gene. Together, the accession collection with broad spectrum and isolate specific blast resistance represent the core material for isolation of previously unknown blast resistance genes and/or their allelic variants that can be deployed in rice breeding programs.
25273267	Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in response to Cd exposure in rice seedlings.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Independent transcriptome profile analyses of miRNAs or mRNAs under conditions of cadmium (Cd) stress have been widely reported in plants. However, a combined analysis of sRNA sequencing expression data with miRNA target expression data to infer the relative activities of miRNAs that regulate gene expression changes resulting from Cd stress has not been reported in rice. To elucidate the roles played by miRNAs in the regulation of changes in gene expression in response to Cd stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we simultaneously characterized changes in the miRNA and mRNA profiles following treatment with Cd.

RESULTS: A total of 163 miRNAs and 2,574 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed under Cd stress, and the changes in the gene expression profile in the shoot were distinct from those in the root. At the miRNA level, 141 known miRNAs belonging to 48 families, and 39 known miRNAs in 23 families were identified to be differentially expressed in the root and shoot, respectively. In addition, we identified eight new miRNA candidates from the root and five from the shoot that were differentially expressed in response to Cd treatment. For the mRNAs, we identified 1,044 genes in the root and 448 genes in the shoot that were up-regulated, while 572 and 645 genes were down-regulated in the root and shoot, respectively. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that genes encoding secondary, metabolite synthases, signaling molecules, and ABC transporters were significantly enriched in the root, while only ribosomal protein and carotenoid biosynthesis genes were significantly enriched in the shoot. Then 10 known miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and six new candidate ones, that showed the opposite expression patterns, were identified by aligning our two datasets against online databases and by using the UEA sRNA toolkit respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use high throughput DNA sequencing to simultaneously detect changes in miRNA and mRNA expression patterns in the root and shoot in response to Cd treatment. These integrated high-throughput expression data provide a valuable resource to examine global genome expression changes in response to Cd treatment and how these are regulated by miRNAs.
25344813	Rice cytochrome P450 MAX1 homologs catalyze distinct steps in strigolactone biosynthesis.	2014	Nat Chem Biol	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of phytohormones and rhizosphere signaling compounds with high structural diversity. Three enzymes, carotenoid isomerase DWARF27 and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases CCD7 and CCD8, were previously shown to convert all-trans-β-carotene to carlactone (CL), the SL precursor. However, how CL is metabolized to SLs has remained elusive. Here, by reconstituting the SL biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that a rice homolog of Arabidopsis More Axillary Growth 1 (MAX1), encodes a cytochrome P450 CYP711 subfamily member that acts as a CL oxidase to stereoselectively convert CL into ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol (B-C lactone ring formation), the presumed precursor of rice SLs. A protein encoded by a second rice MAX1 homolog then catalyzes the conversion of ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol to orobanchol. We therefore report that two members of CYP711 enzymes can catalyze two distinct steps in SL biosynthesis, identifying the first enzymes involved in B-C ring closure and a subsequent structural diversification step of SLs.
25366771	Genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analysis of the SBP-box gene family in melons.	2014	Genet Mol Res	The SBP-box gene family is specific to plants and encodes a class of zinc finger-containing transcription factors with a broad range of functions. Although SBP-box genes have been identified in numerous plants, including green algae, moss, silver birch, snapdragon, Arabidopsis, rice, and maize, there is little information concerning SBP-box genes, or the corresponding miR156/157, function in melon. Using the highly conserved sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana SBP-box domain protein as a probe of information sequence, the genome-wide protein database of melon was explored to obtain 13 SBP-box protein sequences, which were further divided into 4 groups, based on phylogenetic analysis. A further analysis centered on the melon SBP-box genetic family's phylogenetic evolution, sequence similarities, gene structure, and miR156 target sequence was also conducted. Analysis of all the expression patterns of melon SBP-box family genes showed that the SBP-box genes were detected in 7 kinds of tissue, and fruit had the highest expression level. CmSBP11 tends to present its specific expression in melon fruit and root. CmSBP09 expression was the highest in flower. Overall, the molecular evolution and expression pattern of the melon SBP-box gene family, revealed by these results, suggest its function differentiation that followed gene duplication.
25336565	The stripe rust resistance gene Yr10 encodes an evolutionary-conserved and unique CC-NBS-LRR sequence in wheat.	2014	Mol Plant	The first seedling or all-stage resistance (R) R gene against stripe rust isolated from Moro wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a map-based cloning approach was identified as Yr10. Clone 4B of this gene encodes a highly evolutionary-conserved and unique CC-NBS-LRR sequence. Clone 4E, a homolog of Yr10, but lacking transcription start site (TSS) and putative TATA-box and CAAT-box, is likely a non-expressed pseudogene. Clones 4B and 4E are 84% identical and divergent in the intron and the LRR domain. Gene silencing and transgenesis were used in conjunction with inoculation with differentially avirulent and virulent stripe rust strains to demonstrate Yr10 functionality. The Yr10 CC-NBS-LRR sequence is unique among known CC-NBS-LRR R genes in wheat but highly conserved homologs (E = 0.0) were identified in Aegilops tauschii and other monocots including Hordeum vulgare and Brachypodium distachyon. Related sequences were also identified in genomic databases of maize, rice, and in sorghum. This is the first report of a CC-NBS-LRR resistance gene in plants with limited homologies in its native host, but with numerous homologous R genes in related monocots that are either host or non-hosts for stripe rust. These results represent a unique example of gene evolution and dispersion across species.
25336682	Traits and QTLs for development of dry direct-seeded rainfed rice varieties.	2015	J Exp Bot	The development of rice varieties for dry direct-seeded conditions can be accelerated by selecting suitable traits. In the present investigation, traits hypothesized to be important for direct-seeded conditions in rainfed systems, including seedling emergence, early vegetative vigour, nutrient uptake, nodal root number, and root hair length and density, were characterized to study the genetic control of these traits and their relationship with grain yield under seedling- and reproductive-stage drought stress. Two BC₂F₄ mapping populations derived from crosses of Aus276, a drought-tolerant aus variety, with MTU1010 and IR64, high-yielding indica mega-varieties, were developed and studied to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that showed large and consistent effects. A total of 26 QTLs associated with 23 traits and 20 QTLs associated with 13 traits were mapped in the Aus276/3*IR64 and Aus276/3*MTU1010 populations, respectively. qGY₆.₁, qGY₁₀.₁, qGY₁.₁, and qEVV₉.₁ were found to be effective in both populations under a wide range of conditions. QTLs for several seedling-stage traits co-located with QTLs for grain yield, including early vegetative vigour and root hair length. On chromosome 5, several QTLs for nutrient uptake co-located with QTLs for root hair density and nematode gall rating. Six lines were selected from both populations based on grain yield and the presence of QTLs, and these lines typically showed improved seedling-stage traits (nodal root number, dry shoot weight, and root hair length and density). The co-located QTLs identified here can be used in research aimed at increasing the yield and adaptability of rainfed rice to direct-seeded conditions.
25311959	Enantioselective degradation of metalaxyl in grape, tomato, and rice plants.	2015	Chirality	Enantioselective biodegradation of chiral pesticide metalaxyl in grape, tomato, and rice plants under field conditions were studied. Metalaxyl enantiomers were completely separated with a resolution (Rs) of 5.01 by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based on a cellulose tris (3-chloro-4-methyl phenyl carbamate) chiral column (Lux Cellulose-2). Metalaxyl enantiomers from matrixes were extracted by acetonitrile and purged using Cleanert Alumina-A solid phase extraction (SPE). The linearity, recovery, precision, sensitivity, and matrix effect of the method were assessed. The result showed that significant stereoselectivity occurred in grape, tomato, and rice plants. In grape, (+)-S-metalaxyl with a half-life of 5.5 d degraded faster than (-)-R-metalaxyl with that of 6.9 d, and the enantiomer fraction (EF) value reached 0.37 at 21 d. The same enantioselectivity was observed in tomato, and the half-life was 2.2 d for the S-enantiomer and 3.0 d for the R-enantiomer. The EF values decreased from 0.49 of 0 d to 0.26 of 14 d. On the other hand, a preferential degradation of the R-form was found in rice plants, with an EF value of 0.70 at 14 d, and the corresponding half-life was 2.3 d for the R-form and 2.8 d for the S-form.
25428432	Identification and molecular characterization of tissue-preferred rice genes and their upstream regularly sequences on a genome-wide level.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Gene upstream regularly sequences (URSs) can be used as one of the tools to annotate the biological functions of corresponding genes. In addition, tissue-preferred URSs are frequently used to drive the transgene expression exclusively in targeted tissues during plant transgenesis. Although many rice URSs have been molecularly characterized, it is still necessary and valuable to identify URSs that will benefit plant transformation and aid in analyzing gene function.

RESULTS: In this study, we identified and characterized root-, seed-, leaf-, and panicle-preferred genes on a genome-wide level in rice. Subsequently, their expression patterns were confirmed through quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) by randomly selecting 9candidate tissue-preferred genes. In addition, 5 tissue-preferred URSs were characterized by investigating the URS::GUS transgenic plants. Of these URS::GUS analyses, the transgenic plants harboring LOC_Os03g11350 URS::GUS construct showed the GUS activity only in young pollen. In contrast, when LOC_Os10g22450 URS was used to drive the reporter GUS gene, the GUS activity was detected only in mature pollen. Interestingly, the LOC_Os10g34360 URS was found to be vascular bundle preferred and its activities were restricted only to vascular bundles of leaves, roots and florets. In addition, we have also identified two URSs from genes LOC_Os02G15090 and LOC_Os06g31070 expressed in a seed-preferred manner showing the highest expression levels of GUS activities in mature seeds.

CONCLUSION: By genome-wide analysis, we have identified tissue-preferred URSs, five of which were further characterized using transgenic plants harboring URS::GUS constructs. These data might provide some evidence for possible functions of the genes and be a valuable resource for tissue-preferred candidate URSs for plant transgenesis.
25472708	Efficient use of energy in anoxia-tolerant plants with focus on germinating rice seedlings.	2015	New Phytol	Anoxia tolerance in plants is distinguished by direction of the sparse supply of energy to processes crucial to cell maintenance and sometimes to growth, as in rice seedlings. In anoxic rice coleoptiles energy is used to synthesise proteins, take up K(+) , synthesise cell walls and lipids, and in cell maintenance. Maintenance of electrochemical H(+) gradients across the tonoplast and plasma membrane is crucial for solute compartmentation and thus survival. These gradients sustain some H(+) -solute cotransport and regulate cytoplasmic pH. Pyrophosphate (PPi ), the alternative energy donor to ATP, allows direction of energy to the vacuolar H(+) -PPi ase, sustaining H(+) gradients across the tonoplast. When energy production is critically low, operation of a biochemical pHstat allows H(+) -solute cotransport across plasma membranes to continue for at least for 18 h. In active (e.g. growing) cells, PPi produced during substantial polymer synthesis allows conversion of PPi to ATP by PPi -phosphofructokinase (PFK). In quiescent cells with little polymer synthesis and associated PPi formation, the PPi required by the vacuolar H(+) -PPi ase and UDPG pyrophosphorylase involved in sucrose mobilisation via sucrose synthase might be produced by conversion of ATP to PPi through reversible glycolytic enzymes, presumably pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. These hypotheses need testing with species characterised by contrasting anoxia tolerance.
25545811	Antisense suppression of LOX3 gene expression in rice endosperm enhances seed longevity.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Lipid peroxidation plays a major role in seed longevity and viability. In rice grains, lipid peroxidation is catalyzed by the enzyme lipoxygenase 3 (LOX3). Previous reports showed that grain from the rice variety DawDam in which the LOX3 gene was deleted had less stale flavour after grain storage than normal rice. The molecular mechanism by which LOX3 expression is regulated during endosperm development remains unclear. In this study, we expressed a LOX3 antisense construct in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants to down-regulate LOX3 expression in rice endosperm. The transgenic plants exhibited a marked decrease in LOX mRNA levels, normal phenotypes and a normal life cycle. We showed that LOX3 activity and its ability to produce 9-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HPOD) from linoleic acid were significantly lower in transgenic seeds than in wild-type seeds by measuring the ultraviolet absorption of 9-HPOD at 234 nm and by high-performance liquid chromatography. The suppression of LOX3 expression in rice endosperm increased grain storability. The germination rate of TS-91 (antisense LOX3 transgenic line) was much higher than the WT (29% higher after artificial ageing for 21 days, and 40% higher after natural ageing for 12 months). To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that decreased LOX3 expression can preserve rice grain quality during storage with no impact on grain yield, suggesting potential applications in agricultural production.
25479006	Genome-wide analysis of microRNAs and their target genes related to leaf senescence of rice.	2014	PLoS One	Grain production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a top priority in ensuring food security for human beings. One of the approaches to increase yield is to delay leaf senescence and to extend the available time for photosynthesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of aging and cellular senescence in eukaryotes. Here, to help understand their biological role in rice leaf senescence, we report identification of miRNAs and their putative target genes by deep sequencing of six small RNA libraries, six RNA-seq libraries and two degradome libraries from the leaves of two super hybrid rice, Nei-2-You 6 (N2Y6, age-resistant rice) and Liang-You-Pei 9 (LYP9, age-sensitive rice). In total 372 known miRNAs, 162 miRNA candidates and 1145 targets were identified. Compared with the expression of miRNAs in the leaves of LYP9, the numbers of miRNAs up-regulated and down-regulated in the leaves of N2Y6 were 47 and 30 at early stage of grain-filling, 21 and 17 at the middle stage, and 11 and 37 at the late stage, respectively. Six miRNA families, osa-miR159, osa-miR160 osa-miR164, osa-miR167, osa-miR172 and osa-miR1848, targeting the genes encoding APETALA2 (AP2), zinc finger proteins, salicylic acid-induced protein 19 (SIP19), auxin response factors (ARF) and NAC transcription factors, respectively, were found to be involved in leaf senescence through phytohormone signaling pathways. These results provided valuable information for understanding the miRNA-mediated leaf senescence of rice, and offered an important foundation for rice breeding.
25488398	Functional analysis of OsPGIP1 in rice sheath blight resistance.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	As one of the most devastating diseases of rice, sheath blight causes severe rice yield loss. However, little progress has been made in rice breeding for sheath blight resistance. It has been reported that polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins can inhibit the degradation of the plant cell wall by polygalacturonases from pathogens. Here, we prokaryotically expressed and purified OsPGIP1 protein, which was verified by Western blot analysis. Activity assay confirmed the inhibitory activity of OsPGIP1 against the PGase from Rhizoctonia solani. In addition, the location of OsPGIP1 was determined by subcellular localization. Subsequently, we overexpressed OsPGIP1 in Zhonghua 11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), and applied PCR and Southern blot analysis to identify the positive T0 transgenic plants with single-copy insertions. Germination assay of the seeds from T1 transgenic plants was carried out to select homozygous OsPGIP1 transgenic lines, and the expression levels of OsPGIP1 in these lines were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Field testing of R. solani inoculation showed that the sheath blight resistance of the transgenic rice was significantly improved. Furthermore, the levels of sheath blight resistance were in accordance with the expression levels of OsPGIP1 in the transgenic lines. Our results reveal the functions of OsPGIP1 and its resistance mechanism to rice sheath blight, which will facilitate rice breeding for sheath blight resistance.
25553855	Recurrent parent genome recovery analysis in a marker-assisted backcrossing program of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	C R Biol	Backcross breeding is the most commonly used method for incorporating a blast resistance gene into a rice cultivar. Linkage between the resistance gene and undesirable units can persist for many generations of backcrossing. Marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) along with marker-assisted selection (MAS) contributes immensely to overcome the main limitation of the conventional breeding and accelerates recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery. The MABC approach was employed to incorporate (a) blast resistance gene(s) from the donor parent Pongsu Seribu 1, the blast-resistant local variety in Malaysia, into the genetic background of MR219, a popular high-yielding rice variety that is blast susceptible, to develop a blast-resistant MR219 improved variety. In this perspective, the recurrent parent genome recovery was analyzed in early generations of backcrossing using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Out of 375 SSR markers, 70 markers were found polymorphic between the parents, and these markers were used to evaluate the plants in subsequent generations. Background analysis revealed that the extent of RPG recovery ranged from 75.40% to 91.3% and from 80.40% to 96.70% in BC1F1 and BC2F1 generations, respectively. In this study, the recurrent parent genome content in the selected BC2F2 lines ranged from 92.7% to 97.7%. The average proportion of the recurrent parent in the selected improved line was 95.98%. MAS allowed identification of the plants that are more similar to the recurrent parent for the loci evaluated in backcross generations. The application of MAS with the MABC breeding program accelerated the recovery of the RP genome, reducing the number of generations and the time for incorporating resistance against rice blast.
25576000	OsARF16, a transcription factor regulating auxin redistribution, is required for iron deficiency response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Sci	Plant response to iron deficiency is the most important feature for survival in Fe-limited soils. Several phytohormones, including auxin, are involved in iron uptake and homeostasis. However, the mechanisms behind how auxin participates in the iron deficiency response in rice are largely unknown. We found that OsARF16 was involved in the iron deficiency response and the induction of iron deficiency response genes. Most Fe-deficient symptoms could be partially restored in the osarf16 mutant, including dwarfism, photosynthesis decline, a reduction in iron content and root system architecture (RSA) regulation. OsARF16 expression was induced in the roots and shoots by Fe deprivation. Restoration of the phenotype could also be mimicked by 1-NOA, an auxin influx inhibitor. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR data indicated that the induction of Fe-deficiency response genes by iron deficiency was more compromised in the osarf16 mutant than in Nipponbare. In conclusion, osarf16, an auxin insensitive mutant, was involved in iron deficiency response in rice. Our results reveal a new biological function for OsARF16 and provide important information on how ARF-medicated auxin signaling affects iron signaling and the iron deficiency response. This work may help us to improve production or increased Fe nutrition of rice to iron deficiency by regulating auxin signaling.
25540933	Comparative phosphoproteome analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae-responsive proteins in susceptible and resistant rice cultivars.	2015	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae interaction, we conducted a time-course phosphoproteomic analysis of leaf samples from resistant and susceptible rice cultivars infected with M. oryzae, with emphasis on the initial biotrophic phase of the interaction. Phosphoproteomic profiling analysis led to the identification of 56 M. oryzae-regulated phosphoprotein spots. MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis unveiled 53 phosphoproteins belonging to 12 functional categories. Phosphorylation within 7 identified phosphoproteins was verified by mapping the phosphorylation sites by nanoLC-MS/MS. Although the phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidation, and protein folding showed similar changes in both compatible and incompatible interactions, differential regulation between the two interactions was documented for the phosphorylation status of defense-related proteins, signaling-related proteins, microtubule-associated proteins, energy-related enzymes, and amino acid synthesis-related proteins. Rice resistance is likely related to several rapidly and strongly triggered signal transduction cascades (e.g., Rac GTPases- and H2O2-mediated rice defense signaling) resulting in a multiple-level activation of defense responses. The six differentially expressed mRNA encoding proteins were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study provides useful clues for the further exploration of the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms of M. oryzae-rice interactions.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although large-scale identification of phosphorylated proteins has been carried out in rice, there is little report on the rice phosphoproteome in response to pathogens in general and in response to M. oryzae in particular. In this study, a time-course comparative phosphoproteomics was performed to analyze the changes of phosphoprotein profiles in rice leaves during early compatible and incompatible interactions with M. oryzae by using a combination of PEG prefractionation, Al(OH)3-MOAC, 2-DE, Pro-Q DPS and mass spectrometry. Fifty-six M. oryzae-regulated phosphoproteins were identified successfully and phosphorylation within 7 identified phosphoproteins was verified by mapping the phosphorylation sites by nanoLC-MS/MS. Our study provides novel insights into the functions of proteins involved in rice resistance and the molecular mechanism of rice resistance against M. oryzae. Furthermore, we propose the working model for the signaling pathways of rice defense in response to M. oryzae.
25443837	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the IQD gene family in Populus trichocarpa.	2014	Plant Sci	IQD proteins are downstream targets of calcium sensors, which play important roles in development and responses to environmental cues in plants. Comprehensive analyses of IQD genes have been conducted in Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, and Brachypodium distachyon, but have not been reported from poplar. The availability of the Populus trichocarpa genome sequence allowed us to conduct phylogenetic, gene structure, chromosomal location, and microarray analyses of the predicted IQD genes in P. trichocarpa. We identified 40 IQD genes (PtIQD1-40) classified in four subfamilies (I-IV). Gene structure and protein motif analyses showed that these genes are relatively conserved within each subfamily. The 40 PtIQD genes are distributed on 18 of the 19 chromosomes, with 16 gene pairs involved in segmental duplication events. The Ka/Ks ratios of the 16 segmentally-duplicated gene pairs show that the duplicated pairs underwent purifying selection with restrictive functional divergence after the duplication events. Analyses of microarray data for 38 PtIQD genes showed tissue/organ-specific expression patterns. We also performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of twelve selected PtIQD genes in plants treated with MeJA and PEG in order to explore their stress-related expression patterns. Our results will be valuable for further analysis of poplar IQD genes to characterize their important biological functions.
25504197	Upregulation of jasmonate biosynthesis and jasmonate-responsive genes in rice leaves in response to a bacterial pathogen mimic.	2015	Funct Integr Genomics	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, secretes several cell wall degrading enzymes including cellulase (ClsA) and lipase/esterase (LipA). Prior treatment of rice leaves with purified cell wall degrading enzymes such as LipA can confer enhanced resistance against subsequent X. oryzae pv. oryzae infection. To understand LipA-induced rice defense responses, microarray analysis was performed 12 h after enzyme treatment of rice leaves. This reveals that 867 (720 upregulated and 147 downregulated) genes are differentially regulated (≥2-fold). A number of genes involved in defense, stress, signal transduction, and catabolic processes were upregulated while a number of genes involved in photosynthesis and anabolic processes were downregulated. The microarray data also suggested upregulation of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic and JA-responsive genes. Estimation of various phytohormones in LipA-treated rice leaves demonstrated a significant increase in the level of JA-Ile (a known active form of JA) while the levels of other phytohormones were not changed significantly with respect to buffer-treated control. This suggests a role for JA-Ile in cell wall damage induced innate immunity. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of ClsA- and LipA-induced rice genes has identified key rice functions that might be involved in elaboration of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-induced innate immunity.
25532120	Growth, physiological adaptation, and gene expression analysis of two Egyptian rice cultivars under salt stress.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Abiotic stressors, such as high salinity, greatly affect plant growth. In an attempt to explore the mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance, physiological parameters of two local Egyptian rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, Sakha 102 and Egyptian Yasmine, were examined under 50 mM NaCl stress for 14 days. The results indicate that Egyptian Yasmine is relatively salt tolerant compared to Sakha 102, and this was evident in its higher dry mass production, lower leaf Na(+) levels, and enhanced water conservation under salt stress conditions. Moreover, Egyptian Yasmine exhibited lower Na(+)/K(+) ratios in all tissues examined under salinity stress. The ability to maintain such traits seemed to differ in the leaves and roots of Egyptian Yasmine, and the root K(+) content was much higher in Egyptian Yasmine than in Sakha 102. In order to understand the basis for these differences, we studied transcript levels of genes encoding Na(+) and K(+) transport proteins in different tissues. In response to salinity stress, Egyptian Yasmine showed induction of expression of some membrane transporter/channel genes that may contribute to Na(+) exclusion from the shoots (OsHKT1;5), limiting excess Na(+) entry into the roots (OsLti6b), K(+) uptake (OsAKT1), and reduced expression of a Na(+) transporter gene (OsHKT2;1). Therefore, the active regulation of genes related to Na(+) transport at the transcription level may be involved in salt tolerance mechanisms of Egyptian Yasmine, and these mechanisms offer the promise of improved salinity stress tolerance in local Egyptian rice genotypes.
25442012	Identification of CROWN ROOTLESS1-regulated genes in rice reveals specific and conserved elements of postembryonic root formation.	2015	New Phytol	In monocotyledons, the root system is mostly composed of postembryonic shoot-borne roots called crown roots. In rice (Oryza sativa), auxin promotes crown root initiation via the LOB-domain transcription factor (LBD) transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1); however, the gene regulatory network downstream of CRL1 remains largely unknown. We tested CRL1 transcriptional activity in yeast and in planta, identified CRL1-regulated genes using an inducible gene expression system and a transcriptome analysis, and used in situ hybridization to demonstrate coexpression of a sample of CRL1-regulated genes with CRL1 in crown root primordia. We show that CRL1 positively regulates 277 genes, including key genes involved in meristem patterning (such as QUIESCENT-CENTER SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX; QHB), cell proliferation and hormone homeostasis. Many genes are homologous to Arabidopsis genes involved in lateral root formation, but about a quarter are rice-specific. Our study reveals that several genes acting downstream of LBD transcription factors controlling postembryonic root formation are conserved between monocots and dicots. It also provides evidence that specific genes are involved in the formation of shoot-derived roots in rice.
25528301	Distinct photorespiratory reactions are preferentially catalyzed by glutamate:glyoxylate and serine:glyoxylate aminotransferases in rice.	2015	J Photochem Photobiol B	The metabolic function of glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT) and serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT) for photorespiration is still not exactly understood so far though it is mostly held that both enzymes may work in parallel in the reaction of glyoxylate to glycine during photorespiration of plants. Here, for the first time, we define the genes encoding GGAT and SGAT and report their biochemical and enzymatic properties in rice plants, in contrast to those from other plant species. Noticeably, GGAT exhibited approximately 18 fold higher catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) with glyoxylate and glutamate than SGAT with glyoxylate and serine, and additionally, rice leaves usually contain 3-4times higher abundance of glutamate relative to serine, implicating that GGAT may preferentially utilize glyoxylate to form glycine over SGAT. When SGAT or GGAT activity was regulated by gene transformation or nitrogen deficiency, respectively, it was observed that the glycine content was positively related to GGAT activities, while both serine and glycine contents were negatively related to SGAT activities. The results suggest that GGAT preferentially catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate into glycine while SGAT is mainly responsible for the transamination reaction of serine to hydroxypyruvate in the photorespiratory pathway of rice.
25439309	TOND1 confers tolerance to nitrogen deficiency in rice.	2015	Plant J	Nitrogen (N), the most important mineral nutrient for plants, is critical to agricultural production systems. N deficiency severely affects rice growth and decreases rice yields. However, excessive use of N fertilizer has caused severe pollution to agricultural and ecological environments. The necessity of breeding of crops that require lower input of N fertilizer has been recognized. Here we identified a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 12, Tolerance Of Nitrogen Deficiency 1 (TOND1), that confers tolerance to N deficiency in the indica cultivar Teqing. Sequence verification of 75 indica and 75 japonica cultivars from 18 countries and regions demonstrated that only 27.3% of cultivars (41 indica cultivars) contain TOND1, whereas 72.7% of cultivars, including the remaining 34 indica cultivars and all 75 japonica cultivars, do not harbor the TOND1 allele. Over-expression of TOND1 increased the tolerance to N deficiency in the TOND1-deficient rice cultivars. The identification of TOND1 provides a molecular basis for breeding rice varieties with improved grain yield despite decreased input of N fertilizers.
25520407	GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 (GSL5) plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Callose plays an important role in pollen development in flowering plants. In rice, 10 genes encoding putative callose synthases have been identified; however, none of them has been functionally characterized. In this study, a rice Glucan Synthase-Like 5 (GSL5) knock-out mutant was isolated that exhibited a severe reduction in fertility. Pollen viability tests indicated that the pollen of the mutant was abnormal while the embryo sac was normal. Further, GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants phenocopied the gsl5 mutant. The RNA expression of GSL5 was found to be knocked out in the gsl5 mutant and knocked down in GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants by real-time reverse transcripion-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. The male sterility of the mutant was due to abnormal microspore development; an analysis of paraffin sections of the mutant anthers at various developmental stages revealed that abnormal microspore development began in late meiosis. Both the knock-out and knock-down of GSL5 caused a lack of callose in the primary cell wall of meiocytes and in the cell plate of tetrads. As a result, the callose wall of the microspores was defective. This was demonstrated by aniline blue staining and an immunogold labeling assay; the microspores could not maintain their shape, leading to premature swelling and even collapsed microspores. These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice.
25270162	Gibberellin secreting rhizobacterium, Pseudomonas putida H-2-3 modulates the hormonal and stress physiology of soybean to improve the plant growth under saline and drought conditions.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	The physiological changes in tolerant soybean plants under salt and drought stress conditions with Pseudomonas putida H-2-3 were investigated. A bacterial isolate H-2-3 was isolated from soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida H-2-3 by 16S rDNA sequences. The treatment of P. putida H-2-3 significantly increased the length, fresh and dry weight of shoot and chlorophyll content in gibberellins (GAs) deficient mutant Waito-c rice seedlings over the control, it might be the presence of GA1, GA4, GA9 and GA20. The soybean plant growth was retarded in salt (120 mM sodium chloride) and drought (15% polyethylene glycol) stress conditions at 10 days treatments, while P. putida H-2-3 effectively enhanced the shoot length and fresh weight of plants suffered at salt and drought stress. The chlorophyll content was lower in abiotic stress conditions and bacterial inoculant P. putida H-2-3 mitigated the stress effects by an evidence of higher quantity of chlorophyll content in plants exposed to salt and drought. The stress hormonal analysis revealed that individual treatment of P. putida H-2-3, salt and drought significantly enhanced the abscisic acid and salicylic acid content than their control. P. putida H-2-3 applied to salt and drought stressed plants showed a lower level of abscisic acid and salicylic acid and a higher level of jasmonic acid content. Under stress condition induced by salt and drought in plants expressed higher level of total polyphenol, superoxide dismutase and radical scavenging activity and no significant changes in flavonoids. The bio-inoculant, P. putida H-2-3 modulated those antioxidants by declining superoxide dismutase, flavonoids and radical scavenging activity. P. putida H-2-3 induced tolerance against abiotic stress was confirmed by a reduction of Na content in abiotic stressed plants. The results suggest that P. putida H-2-3 application reprograms the chlorophyll, stress hormones and antioxidants expression in abiotic stress affected soybean plant and improves their growth under stress environment.
25224158	Positive Darwinian selection is a driving force for the diversification of terpenoid biosynthesis in the genus Oryza.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Terpenoids constitute the largest class of secondary metabolites made by plants and display vast chemical diversity among and within species. Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the pivotal enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis that create the basic carbon skeletons of this class. Functional divergence of paralogous and orthologous TPS genes is a major mechanism for the diversification of terpenoid biosynthesis. However, little is known about the evolutionary forces that have shaped the evolution of plant TPS genes leading to terpenoid diversity.

RESULTS: The orthologs of Oryza Terpene Synthase 1 (OryzaTPS1), a rice terpene synthase gene involved in indirect defense against insects in Oryza sativa, were cloned from six additional Oryza species. In vitro biochemical analysis showed that the enzymes encoded by these OryzaTPS1 genes functioned either as (E)-β-caryophyllene synthases (ECS), or (E)-β-caryophyllene & germacrene A synthases (EGS), or germacrene D & germacrene A synthases (DAS). Because the orthologs of OryzaTPS1 in maize and sorghum function as ECS, the ECS activity was inferred to be ancestral. Molecular evolutionary detected the signature of positive Darwinian selection in five codon substitutions in the evolution from ECS to DAS. Homology-based structure modeling and the biochemical analysis of laboratory-generated protein variants validated the contribution of the five positively selected sites to functional divergence of OryzaTPS1. The changes in the in vitro product spectra of OryzaTPS1 proteins also correlated closely to the changes in in vivo blends of volatile terpenes released from insect-damaged rice plants.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that positive Darwinian selection is a driving force for the functional divergence of OryzaTPS1. This finding suggests that the diverged sesquiterpene blend produced by the Oryza species containing DAS may be adaptive, likely in the attraction of the natural enemies of insect herbivores.
25187853	Differentially-expressed genes in rice infected by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae relative to a flagellin-deficient mutant reveal potential functions of flagellin in host-pathogen interactions.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Plants have evolved a sensitive defense response system that detects and recognizes various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (e.g. flagellin) and induces immune responses to protect against invasion. Transcriptional responses in rice to PAMPs produced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the bacterial blight pathogen, have not yet been defined.

RESULTS: We characterized transcriptomic responses in rice inoculated with the wildtype (WT) Xoo and flagellin-deficient mutant ∆fliC through RNA-seq analysis. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis based on Solexa/Illumina sequencing was used to investigate transcriptomic responses in 30 day-old seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). 1,680 genes were differentially-expressed (DEGs) in rice inoculated with WT relative to ∆fliC; among which 1,159 genes were up-regulated and 521 were down-regulated. Expression patterns of 12 randomly-selected DEGs assayed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) were similar to those detected by DGE analyses, confirming reliability of the DGE data. Functional annotations revealed the up-regulated DEGs are involved in the cell wall, lipid and secondary metabolism, defense response and hormone signaling, whereas the down-regulated ones are associated with photosynthesis. Moreover, 57 and 21 specifically expressed genes were found after WT and ∆fliC treatments, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: DEGs were identified in rice inoculated with WT Xoo relative to ∆fliC. These genes were predicted to function in multiple biological processes, including the defense response and photosynthesis in rice. This study provided additional insights into molecular basis of rice response to bacterial infection and revealed potential functions of bacterial flagellin in the rice-Xoo interactions.
25201296	Effects of a rice major gene Ur1 (Undulate rachis -1) on panicle and grain traits.	2014	Hereditas	A rice dominant gene, Ur1, increases spikelet number per panicle, thereby enlarging sink size. The effects of Ur1 on panicle and grain traits were examined using 'Nishihikari' (N), its Ur1 isogenic line (NU) and their F1, and the sd1-d isogenic line of Taichung 65 (d), the sd1-d-Ur1 isogenic line (u) and their F1. Ur1 increased number of primary branches per panicle (NB1), number of secondary branches per primary branch (NB2) and number of spikelets per single secondary branch (SB2). Increase in NB1 was higher in NU than in u but those in NB2 and SB2 were lower in NU than in u, all of which brought about a lower percentage of secondary-branch spikelets for NU. Regarding secondary-branch spikelets as well as whole spikelets, NU had a higher ripened-grain percentage caused by its higher fertilized-spikelet percentage than u. The above characteristics of NU contribute to its high yielding ability, suggesting that N is a favorable genetic background for Ur1. In addition, number of differentiated (developed+degenerated) secondary branches per primary branch and presence of twined spikelets in the uppermost primary branch of a panicle could be new indicators to discriminate Ur1/Ur1 plants from Ur1/+ and +/+ plants in a segregating population like an F2.
24983886	Molecular evolution of the substrate specificity of ent-kaurene synthases to adapt to gibberellin biosynthesis in land plants.	2014	Biochem J	ent-Kaurene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone gibberellin. In ent-kaurene biosynthesis in flowering plants, two diterpene cyclases (DTCs), ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) synthase (ent-CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS), catalyse the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to ent-CDP and ent-CDP to ent-kaurene, respectively. In contrast, the moss Physcomitrella patens has a bifunctional ent-CPS/KS (PpCPS/KS) that catalyses both cyclization reactions. To gain more insight into the functional diversity of ent-kaurene biosynthetic enzymes in land plants, we focused on DTCs in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. The present paper describes the characterization of two S. moellendorffii DTCs (SmKS and SmDTC3) in vitro. SmDTC3 converted ent-CDP into ent-16α-hydroxykaurane and also used other CDP stereoisomers as substrate. Remarkably, SmKS, which produces ent-kaurene from ent-CDP, showed similar substrate selectivity: both SmKS and SmDTC3 synthesized sandaracopimaradiene from normal CDP. Therefore, the diversity of substrate recognition among KSs from other plants was investigated. PpCPS/KS could use normal CDP and syn-CDP as well as ent-CDP as substrate. In contrast, lettuce KS showed high specificity for ent-CDP, and rice KS recognized only ent-CDP. Our studies imply that ancient KS having low substrate specificity has evolved to be specific for ent-CDP to the biosynthesis of gibberellin.
25200982	A late embryogenesis abundant protein HVA1 regulated by an inducible promoter enhances root growth and abiotic stress tolerance in rice without yield penalty.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Regulation of root architecture is essential for maintaining plant growth under adverse environment. A synthetic abscisic acid (ABA)/stress-inducible promoter was designed to control the expression of a late embryogenesis abundant protein (HVA1) in transgenic rice. The background of HVA1 is low but highly inducible by ABA, salt, dehydration and cold. HVA1 was highly accumulated in root apical meristem (RAM) and lateral root primordia (LRP) after ABA/stress treatments, leading to enhanced root system expansion. Water-use efficiency (WUE) and biomass also increased in transgenic rice, likely due to the maintenance of normal cell functions and metabolic activities conferred by HVA1 which is capable of stabilizing proteins, under osmotic stress. HVA1 promotes lateral root (LR) initiation, elongation and emergence and primary root (PR) elongation via an auxin-dependent process, particularly by intensifying asymmetrical accumulation of auxin in LRP founder cells and RAM, even under ABA/stress-suppressive conditions. We demonstrate a successful application of an inducible promoter in regulating the spatial and temporal expression of HVA1 for improving root architecture and multiple stress tolerance without yield penalty.
25184027	Genome duplication improves rice root resistance to salt stress.	2014	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Salinity is a stressful environmental factor that limits the productivity of crop plants, and roots form the major interface between plants and various abiotic stresses. Rice is a salt-sensitive crop and its polyploid shows advantages in terms of stress resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of genome duplication on rice root resistance to salt stress.

RESULTS: Both diploid rice (HN2026-2x and Nipponbare-2x) and their corresponding tetraploid rice (HN2026-4x and Nipponbare-4x) were cultured in half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 150 mM NaCl for 3 and 5 days. Accumulations of proline, soluble sugar, malondialdehyde (MDA), Na(+) content, H(+) (proton) flux at root tips, and the microstructure and ultrastructure in rice roots were examined. We found that tetraploid rice showed less root growth inhibition, accumulated higher proline content and lower MDA content, and exhibited a higher frequency of normal epidermal cells than diploid rice. In addition, a protective gap appeared between the cortex and pericycle cells in tetraploid rice. Next, ultrastructural analysis showed that genome duplication improved membrane, organelle, and nuclei stability. Furthermore, Na(+) in tetraploid rice roots significantly decreased while root tip H(+) efflux in tetraploid rice significantly increased.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genome duplication improves root resistance to salt stress, and that enhanced proton transport to the root surface may play a role in reducing Na(+) entrance into the roots.
25223543	Fine mapping of qHd1, a minor heading date QTL with pleiotropism for yield traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A minor QTL for heading date located on the long arm of rice chromosome 1 was delimitated to a 95.0-kb region using near isogenic lines with sequential segregating regions. Heading date and grain yield are two key factors determining the commercial potential of a rice variety. In this study, rice populations with sequential segregating regions were developed and used for mapping a minor QTL for heading date, qHd1. A total of 18 populations in six advanced generations through BC2F6 to BC2F11 were derived from a single BC2F3 plant of the indica rice cross Zhenshan 97 (ZS97)///ZS97//ZS97/Milyang 46. The QTL was delimitated to a 95.0-kb region flanked by RM12102 and RM12108 in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 1. Results also showed that qHd1 was not involved in the photoperiodic response, having an additive effect ranging from 2.4 d to 2.9 d observed in near isogenic lines grown in the paddy field and under the controlled conditions of either short day or long day. The QTL had pleiotropic effects on yield traits, with the ZS97 allele delaying heading and increasing the number of spikelets per panicle, the number of grains per panicle and grain yield per plant. The candidate region contains ten annotated genes including two genes with functional information related to the control of heading date. These results lay a foundation for the cloning of qHd1. In addition, this kind of minor QTLs could be of great significance in rice breeding for allowing minor adjustment of heading date and yield traits.
25327517	Rice SNF2 family helicase ENL1 is essential for syncytial endosperm development.	2015	Plant J	The endosperm of cereal grains represents the most important source of human nutrition. In addition, the endosperm provides many investigatory opportunities for biologists because of the unique processes that occur during its ontogeny, including syncytial development at early stages. Rice endospermless 1 (enl1) develops seeds lacking an endosperm but carrying a functional embryo. The enl1 endosperm produces strikingly enlarged amoeboid nuclei. These abnormal nuclei result from a malfunction in mitotic chromosomal segregation during syncytial endosperm development. The molecular identification of the causal gene revealed that ENL1 encodes an SNF2 helicase family protein that is orthologous to human Plk1-Interacting Checkpoint Helicase (PICH), which has been implicated in the resolution of persistent DNA catenation during anaphase. ENL1-Venus (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)) localizes to the cytoplasm during interphase but moves to the chromosome arms during mitosis. ENL1-Venus is also detected on a thread-like structure that connects separating sister chromosomes. These observations indicate the functional conservation between PICH and ENL1 and confirm the proposed role of PICH. Although ENL1 dysfunction also affects karyokinesis in the root meristem, enl1 plants can grow in a field and set seeds, indicating that its indispensability is tissue-dependent. Notably, despite the wide conservation of ENL1/PICH among eukaryotes, the loss of function of the ENL1 ortholog in Arabidopsis (CHR24) has only marginal effects on endosperm nuclei and results in normal plant development. Our results suggest that ENL1 is endowed with an indispensable role to secure the extremely rapid nuclear cycle during syncytial endosperm development in rice.
25341369	Exploring the areas of applicability of whole-genome prediction methods for Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Our simulation results clarify the areas of applicability of nine prediction methods and suggest the factors that affect their accuracy at predicting empirical traits. Whole-genome prediction is used to predict genetic value from genome-wide markers. The choice of method is important for successful prediction. We compared nine methods using empirical data for eight phenological and morphological traits of Asian rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) and data simulated from real marker genotype data. The methods were genomic BLUP (GBLUP), reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression (RKHS), Lasso, elastic net, random forest (RForest), Bayesian lasso (Blasso), extended Bayesian lasso (EBlasso), weighted Bayesian shrinkage regression (wBSR), and the average of all methods (Ave). The objectives were to evaluate the predictive ability of these methods in a cultivar population, to characterize them by exploring the area of applicability of each method using simulation, and to investigate the causes of their different accuracies for empirical traits. GBLUP was the most accurate for one trait, RKHS and Ave for two, and RForest for three traits. In the simulation, Blasso, EBlasso, and Ave showed stable performance across the simulated scenarios, whereas the other methods, except wBSR, had specific areas of applicability; wBSR performed poorly in most scenarios. For each method, the accuracy ranking for the empirical traits was largely consistent with that in one of the simulated scenarios, suggesting that the simulation conditions reflected the factors that affected the method accuracy for the empirical results. This study will be useful for genomic prediction not only in Asian rice, but also in populations from other crops with relatively small training sets and strong linkage disequilibrium structures.
25326264	Overexpression of heat stress-responsive TaMBF1c, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Multiprotein Bridging Factor, confers heat tolerance in both yeast and rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Previously, we found an ethylene-responsive transcriptional co-activator, which was significantly induced by heat stress (HS) in both thermo-sensitive and thermo-tolerant wheat. The corresponding ORF was isolated from wheat, and named TaMBF1c (Multiprotein Bridging Factor1c). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of conserved MBF1 and helix-turn-helix domains at the N- and C-terminus, respectively, which were highly similar to rice ERTCA (Ethylene Response Transcriptional Co-Activator) and Arabidopsis MBF1c. The promoter region of TaMBF1c contained three heat shock elements (HSEs) and other stress-responsive elements. There was no detectable mRNA of TaMBF1c under control conditions, but the transcript was rapidly and significantly induced by heat stress not only at the seedling stage, but also at the flowering stage. It was also slightly induced by drought and H2O2 stresses, as well as by application of the ethylene synthesis precursor ACC, but not, however, by circadian rhythm, salt, ABA or MeJA treatments. Under normal temperatures, TaMBF1c-eGFP protein showed predominant nuclear localization with some levels of cytosol localization in the bombarded onion epidermal cells, but it was mainly detected in the nucleus with almost no eGFP signals in cytosol when the bombarded onion cells were cultured under high temperature conditions. Overexpression of TaMBF1c in yeast imparted tolerance to heat stress compared to cells expressing the vector alone. Most importantly, transgenic rice plants engineered to overexpress TaMBF1c showed higher thermotolerance than control plants at both seedling and reproductive stages. In addition, transcript levels of six Heat Shock Protein and two Trehalose Phosphate Synthase genes were higher in TaMBF1c transgenic lines than in wild-type rice upon heat treatment. Collectively, the present data suggest that TaMBF1c plays a pivotal role in plant thermotolerance and holds promising possibilities for improving heat tolerance in crops.
25351627	Fast-tracking determination of homozygous transgenic lines and transgene stacking using a reliable quantitative real-time PCR assay.	2015	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	The selection of homozygous lines is a crucial step in the characterization of newly generated transgenic plants. This is particularly time- and labor-consuming when transgenic stacking is required. Here, we report a fast and accurate method based on quantitative real-time PCR with a rice gene RBE4 as a reference gene for selection of homozygous lines when using multiple transgenic stacking in rice. Use of this method allowed can be used to determine the stacking of up to three transgenes within four generations. Selection accuracy reached 100 % for a single locus and 92.3 % for two loci. This method confers distinct advantages over current transgenic research methodologies, as it is more accurate, rapid, and reliable. Therefore, this protocol could be used to efficiently select homozygous plants and to expedite time- and labor-consuming processes normally required for multiple transgene stacking. This protocol was standardized for determination of multiple gene stacking in molecular breeding via marker-assisted selection.
25250906	Cloning of Arabidopsis serotonin N-acetyltransferase and its role with caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of melatonin in vitro despite their different subcellular localizations.	2014	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the penultimate enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis. We cloned SNAT from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSNAT) and functionally characterized this enzyme for the first time from dicotyledonous plants. Similar to rice SNAT, AtSNAT was found to localize to chloroplasts with peak enzyme activity at 45 °C (Km , 309 μm; Vmax , 1400 pmol/min/mg protein). AtSNAT also catalyzed 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) into melatonin with high catalytic activity (Km , 51 μm; Vmax , 5300 pmol/min/mg protein). In contrast, Arabidopsis caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (AtCOMT) localized to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, AtCOMT can methylate serotonin into 5-MT with low catalytic activity (Km , 3.396 mm; Vmax , 528 pmol/min/mg protein). These data suggest that serotonin can be converted into either N-acetylserotonin by SNAT or into 5-MT by COMT, after which it is metabolized into melatonin by COMT or SNAT, respectively. To support this hypothesis, serotonin was incubated in the presence of both AtSNAT and AtCOMT enzymes. In addition to melatonin production, the production of major intermediates depended on incubation temperatures; N-acetylserotonin was predominantly produced at high temperatures (45 °C), while low temperatures (37 °C) favored the production of 5-MT. Our results provide biochemical evidence for the presence of a serotonin O-methylation pathway in plant melatonin biosynthesis.
25298209	Increased lodging resistance in long-culm, low-lignin gh2 rice for improved feed and bioenergy production.	2014	Sci Rep	Lignin modification has been a breeding target for the improvements of forage digestibility and energy yields in forage and bioenergy crops, but decreased lignin levels are often accompanied by reduced lodging resistance. The rice mutant gold hull and internode2 (gh2) has been identified to be lignin deficient. GH2 has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2 and encodes cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). We developed a long-culm variety, 'Leaf Star', with superior lodging resistance and a gh phenotype similar to one of its parents, 'Chugoku 117'. The gh loci in Leaf Star and Chugoku 117 were localized to the same region of chromosome 2 as the gh2 mutant. Leaf Star had culms with low lignin concentrations due to a natural mutation in OsCAD2 that was not present in Chugoku 117. However, this variety had high culm strength due to its strong, thick culms. Additionally, this variety had a thick layer of cortical fiber tissue with well-developed secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that rice can be improved for forage and bioenergy production by combining superior lodging resistance, which can be obtained by introducing thick and stiff culm traits, with low lignin concentrations, which can be obtained using the gh2 variety.
25297540	phyA-GFP is spectroscopically and photochemically similar to phyA and comprises both its native types, phyA' and phyA''.	2014	Photochem Photobiol Sci	Low-temperature fluorescence investigations of phyA-GFP used in experiments on its nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning were carried out. In etiolated hypocotyls of phyA-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana expressing phyA-GFP, it was found that it is similar to phyA in spectroscopic parameters with both its native types, phyA' and phyA'', present and their ratio shifted towards phyA'. In transgenic tobacco hypocotyls, native phyA and rice phyA-GFP were also identical to phyA in the wild type whereas phyA-GFP belonged primarily to the phyA' type. Finally, truncated oat Δ6-12 phyA-GFP expressed in phyA-deficient Arabidopsis was represented by the phyA' type in contrast to full-length oat phyA-GFP with an approximately equal proportion of the two phyA types. This correlates with a previous observation that Δ6-12 phyA-GFP can form only numerous tiny subnuclear speckles while its wild-type counterpart can also localize into bigger and fewer subnuclear protein complexes. Thus, phyA-GFP is spectroscopically and photochemically similar or identical to the native phyA, suggesting that the GFP tag does not affect the chromophore. phyA-GFP comprises phyA'-GFP and phyA''-GFP, suggesting that both of them are potential participants in nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning, which may contribute to its complexity.
25333312	Expression of Cry1Ab and Cry2Ab by a polycistronic transgene with a self-cleavage peptide in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Insect resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal protein is a major threat to the long-term use of transgenic Bt crops. Gene stacking is a readily deployable strategy to delay the development of insect resistance while it may also broaden insecticidal spectrum. Here, we report the creation of transgenic rice expressing discrete Cry1Ab and Cry2Ab simultaneously from a single expression cassette using 2A self-cleaving peptides, which are autonomous elements from virus guiding the polycistronic viral gene expression in eukaryotes. The synthetic coding sequences of Cry1Ab and Cry2Ab, linked by the coding sequence of a 2A peptide from either foot and mouth disease virus or porcine teschovirus-1, regardless of order, were all expressed as discrete Cry1Ab and Cry2Ab at high levels in the transgenic rice. Insect bioassays demonstrated that the transgenic plants were highly resistant to lepidopteran pests. This study suggested that 2A peptide can be utilized to express multiple Bt genes at high levels in transgenic crops.
25344844	Thermodynamic analysis of unusually thermostable CutA1 protein from human brain and its protease susceptibility.	2015	J Biochem	Unusually stable proteins are a disadvantage for the metabolic turnover of proteins in cells. The CutA1 proteins from Pyrococcus horikoshii and from Oryza sativa (OsCutA1) have unusually high denaturation temperatures (Td) of nearly 150 and 100 °C, respectively, at pH 7.0. It seemed that the CutA1 protein from the human brain (HsCutA1) also has a remarkably high stability. Therefore, the thermodynamic stabilities of HsCutA1 and its protease susceptibility were examined. The Td was remarkably high, being over 95 °C at pH 7.0. The unfolding Gibbs energy (ΔG(0)H2O) was 174 kJ/mol at 37 °C from the denaturant denaturation. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the unfolding enthalpy and entropy values of HsCutA1 were considerably lower than those of OsCutA1 with a similar stability to HsCutA1, which should be related to flexibility of the unstructured properties in both N- and C-terminals of HsCutA1. HsCutA1 was almost completely digested after 1-day incubation at 37 °C by subtilisin, although OsCutA1 was hardly digested at the same conditions. These results indicate that easily available fragmentation of HsCutA1 with remarkably high thermodynamic stability at the body temperature should be important for its protein catabolism in the human cells.
25344821	Genome wide in silico characterization of Dof gene families of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.).	2015	Mol Biol Rep	The DNA binding with One Finger (Dof) protein is a plant specific transcription factor involved in the regulation of wide range of processes. The analysis of whole genome sequence of pigeonpea has identified 38 putative Dof genes (CcDof) distributed on 8 chromosomes. A total of 17 out of 38 CcDof genes were found to be intronless. A comprehensive in silico characterization of CcDof gene family including the gene structure, chromosome location, protein motif, phylogeny, gene duplication and functional divergence has been attempted. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in 3 major clusters with closely related members in phylogenetic tree revealed common motif distribution. The in silico cis-regulatory element analysis revealed functional diversity with predominance of light responsive and stress responsive elements indicating the possibility of these CcDof genes to be associated with photoperiodic control and biotic and abiotic stress. The duplication pattern showed that tandem duplication is predominant over segmental duplication events. The comparative phylogenetic analysis of these Dof proteins along with 78 soybean, 36 Arabidopsis and 30 rice Dof proteins revealed 7 major clusters. Several groups of orthologs and paralogs were identified based on phylogenetic tree constructed. Our study provides useful information for functional characterization of CcDof genes.
25368624	The non-homologous end-joining pathway is involved in stable transformation in rice.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Stable transformation with T-DNA needs the coordinated activities of many proteins derived from both host plant cells and Agrobacterium. In dicot plants, including Arabidopsis, it has been suggested that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-one of the main DNA double-strand break repair pathways-is involved in the T-DNA integration step that is crucial to stable transformation. However, how this pathway is involved remains unclear as results with NHEJ mutants in Arabidopsis have given inconsistent results. Recently, a system for visualization of stable expression of genes located on T-DNA has been established in rice callus. Stable expression was shown to be reduced significantly in NHEJ knock-down rice calli, suggesting strongly that NHEJ is involved in Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation in rice. Since rice transformation is now efficient and reproducible, rice is a good model plant in which to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of T-DNA integration.
25505034	Plant Omics Data Center: an integrated web repository for interspecies gene expression networks with NLP-based curation.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Comprehensive integration of large-scale omics resources such as genomes, transcriptomes and metabolomes will provide deeper insights into broader aspects of molecular biology. For better understanding of plant biology, we aim to construct a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-derived gene expression network (GEN) repository for a broad range of plant species. So far we have incorporated information about 745 high-quality mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) samples from eight plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula and Glycine max) from the public short read archive, digitally profiled the entire set of gene expression profiles, and drawn GENs by using correspondence analysis (CA) to take advantage of gene expression similarities. In order to understand the evolutionary significance of the GENs from multiple species, they were linked according to the orthology of each node (gene) among species. In addition to other gene expression information, functional annotation of the genes will facilitate biological comprehension. Currently we are improving the given gene annotations with natural language processing (NLP) techniques and manual curation. Here we introduce the current status of our analyses and the web database, PODC (Plant Omics Data Center; http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/podc/), now open to the public, providing GENs, functional annotations and additional comprehensive omics resources.
25537885	Transgenic rice expressing a codon-modified synthetic CP4-EPSPS confers tolerance to broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Highly tolerant herbicide-resistant transgenic rice was developed by expressing codon-modified synthetic CP4--EPSPS. The transformants could tolerate up to 1% commercial glyphosate and has the potential to be used for DSR (direct-seeded rice). Weed infestation is one of the major biotic stress factors that is responsible for yield loss in direct-seeded rice (DSR). Herbicide-resistant rice has potential to improve the efficiency of weed management under DSR. Hence, the popular indica rice cultivar IR64, was genetically modified using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with a codon-optimized CP4-EPSPS (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, with N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide from Petunia hybrida. Integration of the transgenes in the selected rice plants was confirmed by Southern hybridization and expression by Northern and herbicide tolerance assays. Transgenic plants showed EPSPS enzyme activity even at high concentrations of glyphosate, compared to untransformed control plants. T0, T1 and T2 lines were tested by herbicide bioassay and it was confirmed that the transgenic rice could tolerate up to 1% of commercial Roundup, which is five times more in dose used to kill weeds under field condition. All together, the transgenic rice plants developed in the present study could be used efficiently to overcome weed menace.
25512054	Genes associated with thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice identified by comparative expression profiling.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines and photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PGMS) lines have been successfully used in hybridization to improve rice yields. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility transitions in most PGMS/TGMS rice lines are unclear. In the recently developed TGMS-Co27 line, the male sterility is based on co-suppression of a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene (Ugp1), but further study is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.

RESULTS: Microarray-based transcriptome profiling of TGMS-Co27 and wild-type Hejiang 19 (H1493) plants grown at high and low temperatures revealed that 15462 probe sets representing 8303 genes were differentially expressed in the two lines, under the two conditions, or both. Environmental factors strongly affected global gene expression. Some genes important for pollen development were strongly repressed in TGMS-Co27 at high temperature. More significantly, series-cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TGMS-Co27 plants grown under the two conditions showed that low temperature induced the expression of a gene cluster. This cluster was found to be essential for sterility transition. It includes many meiosis stage-related genes that are probably important for thermosensitive male sterility in TGMS-Co27, inter alia: Arg/Ser-rich domain (RS)-containing zinc finger proteins, polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins (PTBs), DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases, ZOS (C2H2 zinc finger proteins of Oryza sativa), at least one polyadenylate-binding protein and some other RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain-containing proteins involved in post-transcriptional processes, eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B), ribosomal proteins (L37, L1p/L10e, L27 and L24), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs), eukaryotic elongation factor Tu (eEF-Tu) and a peptide chain release factor protein involved in translation. The differential expression of 12 DEGs that are important for pollen development, low temperature responses or TGMS was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).

CONCLUSIONS: Temperature strongly affects global gene expression and may be the common regulator of fertility in PGMS/TGMS rice lines. The identified expression changes reflect perturbations in the transcriptomic regulation of pollen development networks in TGMS-Co27. Findings from this and previous studies indicate that sets of genes involved in post-transcriptional and translation processes are involved in thermosensitive male sterility transitions in TGMS-Co27.
25480961	Genotyping of endosperms to determine seed dormancy genes regulating germination through embryonic, endospermic, or maternal tissues in rice.	2014	G3 (Bethesda)	Seed dormancy is imposed by one or more of the embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissues that belong to two generations and represent two ploidy levels. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for seed dormancy as measured by gross effects on reduced germination rate or delayed germination in crop or model plants. This research developed an endosperm genotype-based genetic approach to determine specific tissues through which a mapped QTL regulates germination using rice as a model. This approach involves testing germination velocity for partially after-ripened seeds harvested from single plants heterozygous for a tested QTL and genotyping endosperms from individual germinated and nongerminated seeds with a codominant DNA marker located on the QTL peak region. Information collected about the QTL includes genotypic frequencies in germinated and/or nongerminated subpopulations; allelic frequency distributions during a germination period; endosperm or embryo genotypic differences in germination velocity; and genotypic frequencies for gametes involved in the double fertilization to form the sampled seeds. Using this approach, the seed dormancy loci SD12, SD1-2, and SD7-1 were determined to regulate germination through the embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissues, respectively; SD12 and SD1-2 acted additively on germination velocity in the offspring tissues; and SD12 also was associated with the preferential fertilization of male gametes in rice. This new genetic approach can be used to characterize mapped genes/QTL for tissue-specific functions in endospermic seeds and for marker-assisted selection of QTL alleles before or immediately after germination in crop breeding.
25438645	Identification and comparative analysis of microRNAs in barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) in response to rice allelopathy.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Rice allelopathy is a hot topic in the field of allelopathy, and behaviour of donor allelopathic rice has been well documented. However, few study addresses response of receiver barnyardgrass (BYG). We found that expression of miRNAs relevant to plant hormone signal transduction, nucleotide excision repair and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and p53 signalling pathways was enhanced in BYG co-cultured with the allelopathic rice cultivar PI312777, the expression levels of these miRNAs in BYG plants were positively correlated with allelopathic potential of the co-cultured rice varieties. Treatment of BYG plants with rice-produced phenolic acids also increased miRNA expression in BYG, while treatment with rice-produced terpenoids had no obvious effect on miRNA expression. In the hydroponic system, the largest number of Myxococcus sp. was found in the growth medium containing rice with the highest allelopathic potential. The addition of phenolic acids in the hydroponic medium also increased the number of Myxococcus sp. More interestingly, inoculation with Myxococcus xanthus significantly increased miRNA expression in the treated BYG. Jointed treatments of ferulic acid and M. xanthus led to strongest growth inhibition of BYG. The results suggest that there exist involvement of Myxococcus sp. and mediation of miRNA expression in rice allelopathy against BYG.
25487270	Molecular identification of one event of Ds excision and re-insertion at two loci in rice genome.	2014	Yi Chuan	The maize Ac/Ds transposable elements are members of the hAT transposon superfamily, and have stable transpositional activity in transgenic rice plants. Ac/Ds transposable elements are considered to transpose via a conservative non-replicative "cut and paste" model, though their transposition mechanism is not completely understood. Previous studies have shown that Ds preferentially transposes to genetically linked sites after being excised from its original site in the presence of Ac-transposase. In this study, genomic sequences flanking Ds insertions from a Ds-tagged rice mutant and its rever- tant were determined by TAIL-PCR. The Ds insertion site, the excision footprint and the re-insertion sites in the mutant were identified using bioinformatics tool. The results showed that Ds element excised from its original insertion site on chromosome 3 by leaving an 8 bp footprint (CATCATGA), which resulted in exon changes in tagged gene. After the excision, Ds element was re-inserted into the coding sequences of two genes on chromosome 2 and chromosome 6, which encode a nicotianamine aminotransferase and a senescence-associated protein, respectively. The transposition behavior of Ds element in this study could not be fully explained by the "cut and paste" mechanism, while it is likely to transpose in a "cut and copy and paste" way.
25572229	Expression of the rgMT gene, encoding for a rice metallothionein-like protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana.	2014	J Genet	Metallothioneins (MTs) are cysteine-rich proteins of low molecular weight with many attributed functions, such as providing protection against metal toxicity, being involved in regulation of metal ions uptake that can impact plant physiology and providing protection against oxidative stress. However, the precise function of the metallothionein-like proteins such as the one coded for rgMT gene isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) is not completely understood. The whole genome analysis of rice (O. sativa) showed that the rgMT gene is homologue to the Os11g47809 on chromosome 11 of O. sativa sp. japonica genome. This study used the rgMT coding sequence to create transgenic lines to investigate the subcellular localization of the protein, as well as the impact of gene expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Arabidopsis thaliana under heavy metal ion, salt and oxidative stresses. The results indicate that the rgMT gene was expressed in the cytoplasm of transgenic cells. Yeast cells transgenic for rgMT showed vigorous growth compared to the nontransgenic controls when exposed to 7 mM CuCl2, 10 mM FeCl2, 1 M NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3 and 3.2 mM H2O2, but there was no significant difference for other stresses tested. Similarly, Arabidopsis transgenic for rgMT displayed significantly improved seed germination rates over that of the control when the seeds were stressed with 100 μM CuCl2 or 1 mM H2O2. Increased biomass was observed in the presence of 100 μM CuCl2, 220 μM FeCl2, 3 mM Na2CO3, 5 mM NaHCO3 or 1 mM H2O2. These results indicate that the expression of the rice rgMT gene in transgenic yeast and Arabidopsis is implicated in improving their tolerance for certain salt and peroxide stressors.
25524588	Unusual tandem expansion and positive selection in subgroups of the plant GRAS transcription factor superfamily.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: GRAS proteins belong to a plant transcription factor family that is involved with multifarious roles in plants. Although previous studies of this protein family have been reported for Arabidopsis, rice, Chinese cabbage and other species, investigation of expansion patterns and evolutionary rate on the basis of comparative genomics in different species remains inadequate.

RESULTS: A total of 289 GRAS genes were identified in Arabidopsis, B. distachyon, rice, soybean, S. moellendorffii, and P. patens and were grouped into seven subfamilies, supported by the similarity of their exon-intron patterns and structural motifs. All of tandem duplicated genes were found in group II except one cluster of rice, indicating that tandem duplication greatly promoted the expansion of group II. Furthermore, segment duplications were mainly found in the soybean genome, whereas no single expansion pattern dominated in other plant species indicating that GRAS genes from these five species might be subject to a more complex evolutionary mechanism. Interestingly, branch-site model analyses of positive selection showed that a number of sites were positively selected under foreground branches I and V. These results strongly indicated that these groups were experiencing higher positive selection pressure. Meanwhile, the site-specific model revealed that the GRAS genes were under strong positive selection in P. patens. DIVERGE v2.0 was used to detect critical amino acid sites, and the results showed that the shifted evolutionary rate was mainly attributed to the functional divergence between the GRAS genes in the two groups. In addition, the results also demonstrated the expression divergence of the GRAS duplicated genes in the evolution. In short, the results above provide a solid foundation for further functional dissection of the GRAS gene superfamily.

CONCLUSIONS: In this work, differential expression, evolutionary rate, and expansion patterns of the GRAS gene family in the six species were predicted. Especially, tandem duplication events played an important role in expansion of group II. Together, these results contribute to further functional analysis and the molecular evolution of the GRAS gene superfamily.
25532750	Chromosomal locations of a gene underlying heat-accelerated brown spot formation and its suppressor genes in rice.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Brown spots on mature leaves from the heading to ripening stages in rice are considered to be lesions induced by heat stress. However, there are few studies of lesions that are induced by heat stress rather than by pathogen infections. To understand the genetic background underlying such lesions, we used the chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) SL518, derived from a distant cross between rice cultivars Koshihikari (japonica) and Nona Bokra (indica). We observed brown spots on mature leaf blades of the CSSL, although the parents barely showed any spots. Spot formation in SL518 was accelerated by high temperature, suggesting that the candidate gene for spot formation is related to heat stress response. Using progeny derived from a cross between SL518 and Koshihikari, we mapped the causative gene, BROWN-SPOTTED LEAF 1 (BSPL1), on chromosome 5. We speculated that one or more Nona Bokra genes suppress spot formation caused by BSPL1 and identified candidate genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 9 using a cross between a near-isogenic line for BSPL1 and other CSSLs possessing Nona Bokra segments in the Koshihikari genetic background. In conclusion, our data support the concept that multiple genes are complementarily involved in brown spot formation induced by heat stress and will be useful for cloning of the novel gene(s) related to the spot formation.
25252199	Effects of active site cleft residues on oligosaccharide binding, hydrolysis, and glycosynthase activities of rice BGlu1 and its mutants.	2014	Protein Sci	Rice BGlu1 (Os3BGlu7) is a glycoside hydrolase family 1 β-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cellooligosaccharides with increasing efficiency as the degree of polymerization (DP) increases from 2 to 6, indicating six subsites for glucosyl residue binding. Five subsites have been identified in X-ray crystal structures of cellooligosaccharide complexes with its E176Q acid-base and E386G nucleophile mutants. X-ray crystal structures indicate that cellotetraose binds in a similar mode in BGlu1 E176Q and E386G, but in a different mode in the BGlu1 E386G/Y341A variant, in which glucosyl residue 4 (Glc4) interacts with Q187 instead of the eliminated phenolic group of Y341. Here, we found that the Q187A mutation has little effect on BGlu1 cellooligosaccharide hydrolysis activity or oligosaccharide binding in BGlu1 E176Q, and only slight effects on BGlu1 E386G glycosynthase activity. X-ray crystal structures showed that cellotetraose binds in a different position in BGlu1 E176Q/Y341A, in which it interacts directly with R178 and W337, and the Q187A mutation had little effect on cellotetraose binding. Mutations of R178 and W337 to A had significant and nonadditive effects on oligosaccharide hydrolysis by BGlu1, pNPGlc cleavage and cellooligosaccharide inhibition of BGlu1 E176Q and BGlu1 E386G glycosynthase activity. Hydrolysis activity was partially rescued by Y341 for longer substrates, suggesting stacking of Glc4 on Y341 stabilizes binding of cellooligosaccharides in the optimal position for hydrolysis. This analysis indicates that complex interactions between active site cleft residues modulate substrate binding and hydrolysis.
25227951	Gα modulates salt-induced cellular senescence and cell division in rice and maize.	2014	J Exp Bot	The plant G-protein network, comprising Gα, Gβ, and Gγ core subunits, regulates development, senses sugar, and mediates biotic and abiotic stress responses. Here, we report G-protein signalling in the salt stress response using two crop models, rice and maize. Loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding genes encoding the Gα subunit attenuate growth inhibition and cellular senescence caused by sodium chloride (NaCl). Gα null mutations conferred reduced leaf senescence, chlorophyll degradation, and cytoplasm electrolyte leakage under NaCl stress. Sodium accumulated in both wild-type and Gα-mutant shoots to the same levels, suggesting that Gα signalling controls cell death in leaves rather than sodium exclusion in roots. Growth inhibition is probably initiated by osmotic change around root cells, because KCl and MgSO4 also suppressed seedling growth equally as well as NaCl. NaCl lowered rates of cell division and elongation in the wild-type leaf sheath to the level of the Gα-null mutants; however there was no NaCl-induced decrease in cell division in the Gα mutant, implying that the osmotic phase of salt stress suppresses cell proliferation through the inhibition of Gα-coupled signalling. These results reveal two distinct functions of Gα in NaCl stress in these grasses: attenuation of leaf senescence caused by sodium toxicity in leaves, and cell cycle regulation by osmotic/ionic stress.
25208036	Cloning and characterization of a serotonin N-acetyltransferase from a gymnosperm, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda).	2014	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the penultimate enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis in both animals and plants. SNAT catalyzes serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, an immediate precursor for melatonin biosynthesis by N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT). We cloned the SNAT gene from a gymnosperm loblolly pine (Pinus teada). The loblolly pine SNAT (PtSNAT) gene encodes 255 amino acids harboring a transit sequence with 67 amino acids and shows 67% amino acid identity with rice SNAT when comparing the mature polypeptide regions. Purified recombinant PtSNAT showed peak activity at 55°C with the K(m) (428 μM) and Vmax (3.9 nmol/min/mg protein) values. As predicted, PtSNAT localized to chloroplasts. The SNAT mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues, including leaf, bud, flower, and pinecone, whereas the corresponding protein was detected only in leaf. In accordance with the exclusive SNAT protein expression in leaf, melatonin was detected only in leaf at 0.45 ng per gram fresh weight. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the gymnosperm PtSNAT had high homology with SNATs from all plant phyla (even with cyanobacteria), and formed a clade separated from the angiosperm SNATs, suggestive of direct gene transfer from cyanobacteria via endosymbiosis.
25231087	Malaysian weedy rice shows its true stripes: wild Oryza and elite rice cultivars shape agricultural weed evolution in Southeast Asia.	2014	Mol Ecol	Weedy rice is a close relative of domesticated rice (Oryza sativa) that competes aggressively with the crop and limits rice productivity worldwide. Most genetic studies of weedy rice have focused on populations in regions where no reproductively compatible wild Oryza species occur (North America, Europe and northern Asia). Here, we examined the population genetics of weedy rice in Malaysia, where wild rice (O. rufipogon) can be found growing in close proximity to cultivated and weedy rice. Using 375 accessions and a combined analysis of 24 neutral SSR loci and two rice domestication genes (sh4, controlling seed shattering, and Bh4, controlling hull colour), we addressed the following questions: (i) What is the relationship of Malaysian weedy rice to domesticated and wild rice, and to weedy rice strains in the USA? (ii) To what extent does the presence of O. rufipogon influence the genetic and phenotypic diversity of Malaysian weeds? (iii) What do the distributions of sh4 and Bh4 alleles and associated phenotypes reveal about the origin and contemporary evolution of Malaysian weedy rice? Our results reveal the following: independent evolutionary origins for Malaysian weeds and US strains, despite their very close phenotypic resemblance; wild-to-weed gene flow in Malaysian weed populations, including apparent adaptive introgression of seed-shattering alleles; and a prominent role for modern Malaysian cultivars in the origin and recent proliferation of Malaysian weeds. These findings suggest that the genetic complexity and adaptability of weedy crop relatives can be profoundly influenced by proximity to reproductively compatible wild and domesticated populations.
25306526	Acceleration of cyclic electron flow in rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) deficient in the PsbS protein of Photosystem II.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	When compared with Photosystem I (PSI) in wild-type (WT) rice plants, PSI in PsbS-knockout (KO) plants that lack the energy-dependent component of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) was less sensitive to photoinhibition. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between NPQ and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI as a photoprotective mechanism. Activities of two CEF routes (PGR5-dependent or NDH-dependent) were compared between those genotypes by using both dark-adapted plants and pre-illuminated plants, i.e., those in which the Calvin-Benson cycle is de-activated and activated, respectively. In dark-adapted leaves activity of the PGR5-dependent route was determined as the rate of P700 photooxidation. Activity was higher in the mutants than in the WT. However, no difference was noted when plants of either genotype were pre-illuminated. When the electron transport pathway was switched to the cyclic mode by infiltrating leaf segments with 150 mM sorbitol, 40 μM DCMU, and 2 mM hydroxylamine, the rate of P700 oxidation was faster in the mutant. That difference disappeared when leaves were infiltrated with antimycin A to inhibit the PGR5-dependent route. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fo) was also evaluated. To achieve an Fo level comparable to that of the WT, activation of the NDH-dependent route in the mutant required pre-illumination at a certain dose. Therefore, we propose that, as an alternate pathway for the photoprotection of photosystems in the absence of energy-dependent quenching, this PGR5-dependent route is more highly activated in the PsbS-KO mutants than in the WT. Moreover, that stronger activity is probably responsible for slower activation of the NDH-dependent route in the mutant.
25528599	Pectin enhances rice (Oryza sativa) root phosphorus remobilization.	2015	J Exp Bot	Plants growing in phosphorus (P)-deficient conditions can either increase their exploration of the environment (hence increasing P uptake) or can solubilize and reutilize P from established tissue sources. However, it is currently unclear if P stored in root cell wall can be reutilized. The present study shows that culture of the rice cultivars 'Nipponbare' (Nip) and 'Kasalath' (Kas) in P-deficient conditions results in progressive reductions in root soluble inorganic phosphate (Pi). However, Nip consistently maintains a higher level of soluble Pi and lower relative cell wall P content than does Kas, indicating that more cell wall P is released in Nip than in Kas. P-deficient Nip has a greater pectin and hemicellulose 1 (HC1) content than does P-deficient Kas, consistent with the significant positive relationship between pectin and root-soluble Pi levels amongst multiple rice cultivars. These observations suggest that increased soluble Pi might result from increased pectin content during P starvation. In vitro experiments showed that pectin releases Pi from insoluble FePO4. Furthermore, an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with reduced pectin levels (qua1-2), has less root soluble Pi and is more sensitive to P deficiency than the wild type (WT) Col-0, whereas NaCl-treated WT plants exhibit both an increased root pectin content and an elevated soluble Pi content during P-starvation. These observations indicate that pectin can facilitate the remobilization of P deposited in the cell wall. This is a previously unknown mechanism for the reutilization of P in P-starved plants.
25479236	RNA-seq analysis of oil palm under cold stress reveals a different C-repeat binding factor (CBF) mediated gene expression pattern in Elaeis guineensis compared to other species.	2014	PLoS One	Elaeis guineensis as a tropical oil-crop is particularly sensitive to low temperature. Improvement of cold-tolerance may significantly increase the total cultivation area of this tropical oil-crop worldwide. We sequenced cold-treated and control (untreated) samples of Elaeis guineensis. De novo assembly generated 51,452 unigenes with an average length of 703 bp. Subsequently, these expressed sequences were functionally annotated. In the K category (transcription factors) of COG (Cluster of Orthologous Group) annotation, the largest proportion of genes induced and repressed at least two-fold under cold stress were from the AP2/ERE family, indicating that C-repeat binding factor, (CBFs, members of the AP2/ERE family) may play a central role in cold tolerance in Elaeis guineensis. Subsequently, the CBF-mediated signal transduction pathway was reconstructed based on transcriptome data and the gene expression profile involving the pathway was examined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). CBFs reached maximum transcript level both at medium (4 h) and long period time points (7 days), contrary to the expression pattern of CBFs in Arabidopsis and rice. Moreover, the promoters of downstream Cold Responsive gene (CORs) regulated by CBFs were analyzed. Conservation, mutation and absence of the DRE core motif were detected in the promoters of six CORs. These mutations in DRE motifs suggest that CORs may not be induced via cold stress in Elaeis guineensis.
25501945	High light-dependent phosphorylation of photosystem II inner antenna CP29 in monocots is STN7 independent and enhances nonphotochemical quenching.	2015	Plant Physiol	Phosphorylation of the photosystem II antenna protein CP29 has been reported to be induced by excess light and further enhanced by low temperature, increasing resistance to these stressing factors. Moreover, high light-induced CP29 phosphorylation was specifically found in monocots, both C3 and C4, which include the large majority of food crops. Recently, knockout collections have become available in rice (Oryza sativa), a model organism for monocots. In this work, we have used reverse genetics coupled to biochemical and physiological analysis to elucidate the molecular basis of high light-induced phosphorylation of CP29 and the mechanisms by which it exerts a photoprotective effect. We found that kinases and phosphatases involved in CP29 phosphorylation are distinct from those reported to act in State 1-State 2 transitions. In addition, we elucidated the photoprotective role of CP29 phosphorylation in reducing singlet oxygen production and enhancing excess energy dissipation. We thus established, in monocots, a mechanistic connection between phosphorylation of CP29 and nonphotochemical quenching, two processes so far considered independent from one another.
25232936	Genome editing in rice and wheat using the CRISPR/Cas system.	2014	Nat Protoc	Targeted genome editing nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), are powerful tools for understanding gene function and for developing valuable new traits in plants. The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system has recently emerged as an alternative nuclease-based method for efficient and versatile genome engineering. In this system, only the 20-nt targeting sequence within the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) needs to be changed to target different genes. The simplicity of the cloning strategy and the few limitations on potential target sites make the CRISPR/Cas system very appealing. Here we describe a stepwise protocol for the selection of target sites, as well as the design, construction, verification and use of sgRNAs for sequence-specific CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis and gene targeting in rice and wheat. The CRISPR/Cas system provides a straightforward method for rapid gene targeting within 1-2 weeks in protoplasts, and mutated rice plants can be generated within 13-17 weeks.
25223260	OsMLO12, encoding seven transmembrane proteins, is involved with pollen hydration in rice.	2014	Plant Reprod	Hydration is the first step in pollen germination. However, the process is not well understood. OsMLO12 is highly expressed in mature pollen grains; plants containing alleles caused by transfer DNA insertions do not produce homozygous progeny. Reciprocal crosses between wild-type and OsMLO12/osmlo12 plants showed that the mutant alleles were not transmitted through the male gametophyte. Microscopic observations revealed that, although mutant grains became mature pollen with three nuclei, they did not germinate in vitro or in vivo due to a failure in hydration. The OsMLO12 protein has seven transmembrane motifs, with an N-terminal extracellular region and a C-terminal cytosolic region. We demonstrated that the C-terminal region mediates a calcium-dependent interaction with calmodulin. Our findings suggest that pollen hydration is regulated by MLO12, possibly through an interaction with calmodulin in the cytosol.
25148576	Magnetic solid phase extraction coupled with in situ derivatization for the highly sensitive determination of acidic phytohormones in rice leaves by UPLC-MS/MS.	2014	Analyst	A simple, rapid and sensitive method based on magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) coupled with in situ derivatization (ISD) was developed for the determination of endogenous acidic phytohormones in rice leaves by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. With this method, acidic phytohormones were extracted onto the surface of a TiO2/magnetic hollow mesoporous silica sphere (MHMSS) through hydrophilic interaction, and then in situ derivatization was performed by the subsequent addition of 3-bromoactonyltrimethylammonium bromide (BTA). Thus, the process integrated extraction, purification, and derivatization into one step. Additionally, the permanent positively charged moiety from BTA significantly improved the ionization efficiencies of the acidic phytohormones. Several parameters affecting the efficiencies of the extraction, derivatization, and desorption were evaluated. The signal intensities of acidic phytohormones increased by 2 to 481 fold after treatment with MSPE-ISD. Under the optimized conditions, several endogenous acidic phytohormones, including GA4, GA9, GA20, JA, IAA, and ABA, were identified and quantified in rice leaves by the MSPE-ISD method. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 1.03-91.21 pg mL(-1). The relative recoveries ranged from 71.6-112.8%, with the intra- and interday relative standard deviations (RSDs) being less than 14.9% and 16.2%, respectively. Taken together, the proposed method provides a novel approach of combining magnetic solid phase extraction and in situ derivatization for the highly sensitive determination of endogenous acidic phytohormones.
25320554	Effect of quantitative trait loci for seed shattering on abscission layer formation in Asian wild rice Oryza rufipogon.	2014	Breed Sci	Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa L. was domesticated from its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon. During domestication, the cultivated rice lost its seed-shattering behaviour. Previous studies have shown that two major quantitative trait loci (QTLs; qSH1 and sh4) are responsible for the seed-shattering degree. Here, we produced introgression lines carrying non-functional alleles from O. sativa 'Nipponbare' at the two major QTLs in the genetic background of wild rice O. rufipogon W630, and examined the effects of the two QTLs on seed shattering and abscission layer formation. The introgression lines, with Nipponbare alleles at either or both loci, showed complete or partial abscission layer formation, respectively, indicating that other unknown loci might be involved in enhancing seed shattering in wild rice. We detected a single QTL named qSH3 regulating seed-shattering degree using an F2 population between Nipponbare and the introgression line carrying Nipponbare alleles at the two QTLs. Although we generated an introgression line for qSH3 alone, no effects on seed shattering were observed. However, a significant effect on seed-shattering degree was observed for the introgression line carrying Nipponbare alleles at qSH3 and the two QTLs, suggesting an important role of qSH3 on seed shattering in coordination with the two QTLs.
25326616	The evolution of flowering strategies in US weedy rice.	2014	Am J Bot	UNLABELLED: •

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Local adaptation in plants often involves changes in flowering time in response to day length and temperature. Many crops have been selected for uniformity in flowering time. In contrast, variable flowering may be important for increased competitiveness in weed species invading the agricultural environment. Given the shared species designation of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its the invasive conspecific weed, weedy rice, we assessed the extent to which flowering time differed between these groups. We further assessed whether genes affecting flowering time variation in rice could play a role in the evolution of weedy rice in the United States.•

METHODS: We quantified flowering time under day-neutral conditions in weedy, cultivated, and wild Oryza groups. We also sequenced two candidate gene regions: Hd1, a locus involved in promotion of flowering under short days, and the promoter of Hd3a, a locus encoding the mobile signal that induces flowering.•

KEY RESULTS: We found that flowering time has diverged between two distinct weedy rice groups, such that straw-hull weeds tend to flower earlier and black-hull awned weeds tend to flower later than cultivated rice. These differences are consistent with weed Hd1 alleles. At both loci, weeds share haplotypes with their cultivated progenitors, despite significantly different flowering times.•

CONCLUSIONS: Our phenotypic data indicate the existence of multiple flowering strategies in weedy rice. Flowering differences between weeds and ancestors suggest this trait has evolved rapidly. From a weed management standpoint, there is the potential for overlap in flowering of black-hull awned weeds and crops in the United States, permitting hybridization and the potential escape of genes from crops.
25365207	Reflectance variation within the in-chlorophyll centre waveband for robust retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content.	2014	PLoS One	The in-chlorophyll centre waveband (ICCW) (640-680 nm) is the specific chlorophyll (Chl) absorption band, but the reflectance in this band has not been used as an optimal index for non-destructive determination of plant Chl content in recent decades. This study develops a new spectral index based solely on the ICCW for robust retrieval of leaf Chl content for the first time. A glasshouse experiment for solution-culture of one chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant and six wild types of rice genotypes was conducted, and the leaf reflectance (400-900 nm) was measured with a high spectral resolution (1 nm) spectrophotometer and the contents of chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb) and chlorophyll a+b (Chlt) of the rice leaves were determined. It was found that the reflectance curves from 640 nm to 674 nm and from 675 nm to 680 nm of the low-chlorophyll mutant leaf were drastically steeper than that of the wild types in the ICCW. The new index based on the reflectance variation within ICCW, the difference of the first derivative sum within the ICCW (DFDS_ICCW), was highly sensitive (r = -0.77, n = 93, P<0.01) to Chlt while the mean reflectance (R_ICCW) in the ICCW became insensitive (r = -0.12, n = 93, P>0.05) to Chlt when the leaf Chlt was higher than 200 mg/m(2). The best equations of R-ICCW and DFDS_ICCW yielded an RMSE of 78.7, 32.9 and 107.3 mg/m(2), and an RMSE of 37.4, 16.0 and 45.3 mg/m(-2), respectively, for predicting Chla, Chlb and Chlt. The new index could rank in the top 10 for prediction of Chla and Chlt as compared with the 55 existing indices. Additionally, most of the 55 existing Chl-related VIs performed robustly or strongly in simultaneous prediction of leaf Chla, Chlb and Chlt.
25528448	Breeding of ozone resistant rice: relevance, approaches and challenges.	2015	Environ Pollut	Tropospheric ozone concentrations have been rising across Asia, and will continue to rise during the 21st century. Ozone affects rice yields through reductions in spikelet number, spikelet fertility, and grain size. Moreover, ozone leads to changes in rice grain and straw quality. Therefore the breeding of ozone tolerant rice varieties is warranted. The mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) using bi-parental populations identified several tolerance QTL mitigating symptom formation, grain yield losses, or the degradation of straw quality. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated substantial natural genotypic variation in ozone tolerance in rice, and revealed that the genetic architecture of ozone tolerance in rice is dominated by multiple medium and small effect loci. Transgenic approaches targeting tolerance mechanisms such as antioxidant capacity are also discussed. It is concluded that the breeding of ozone tolerant rice can contribute substantially to the global food security, and is feasible using different breeding approaches.
25474210	Recurrent loss of specific introns during angiosperm evolution.	2014	PLoS Genet	Numerous instances of presence/absence variations for introns have been documented in eukaryotes, and some cases of recurrent loss of the same intron have been suggested. However, there has been no comprehensive or phylogenetically deep analysis of recurrent intron loss. Of 883 cases of intron presence/absence variation that we detected in five sequenced grass genomes, 93 were confirmed as recurrent losses and the rest could be explained by single losses (652) or single gains (118). No case of recurrent intron gain was observed. Deep phylogenetic analysis often indicated that apparent intron gains were actually numerous independent losses of the same intron. Recurrent loss exhibited extreme non-randomness, in that some introns were removed independently in many lineages. The two larger genomes, maize and sorghum, were found to have a higher rate of both recurrent loss and overall loss and/or gain than foxtail millet, rice or Brachypodium. Adjacent introns and small introns were found to be preferentially lost. Intron loss genes exhibited a high frequency of germ line or early embryogenesis expression. In addition, flanking exon A+T-richness and intron TG/CG ratios were higher in retained introns. This last result suggests that epigenetic status, as evidenced by a loss of methylated CG dinucleotides, may play a role in the process of intron loss. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of recurrent intron loss, makes a series of novel findings on the patterns of recurrent intron loss during the evolution of the grass family, and provides insight into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying intron loss.
25301195	Unique Genotypic Differences Discovered among Indigenous Bangladeshi Rice Landraces.	2014	Int J Genomics	Bangladesh is a reservoir of diverse rice germplasm and is home to many landraces with unique, important traits. Molecular characterization of these landraces is of value for their identification, preservation, and potential use in breeding programs. Thirty-eight rice landraces from different regions of Bangladesh including some high yielding BRRI varieties were analyzed by 34 polymorphic microsatellite markers yielding a total of 258 reproducible alleles. The analysis could locate 34 unique identifiers for 21 genotypes, making the latter potentially amenable to identity verification. An identity map for these genotypes was constructed with all the 12 chromosomes of the rice genome. Polymorphism information content (PIC) scores of the 34 SSR markers were 0.098 to 0.89 where on average 7.5 alleles were observed. A dendogram constructed using UPGMA clustered the varieties into two major groups and five subgroups. In some cases, the clustering matched with properties like aromaticity, stickiness, salt tolerance, and photoperiod insensitivity. The results will help breeders to work towards the proper utilization of these landraces for parental selection and linkage map construction for discovery of useful alleles.
25270231	Physiological analyses of traits associated with tolerance of long-term partial submergence in rice.	2014	AoB Plants	Floods are major constraints to crop production worldwide. In low-lying, flood-prone areas of the tropics, longer-term partial submergence (stagnant flooding [SF]) greatly reduces rice yield. This study assesses shoot growth and several physiological mechanisms associated with SF tolerance in rice. Five rice genotypes with contrasting responses to SF were evaluated in field ponds. Following transplanting, floodwater was gradually increased at a rate of ∼2 cm day(-1) to reach a final depth of 50 cm and then maintained until maturity. Although plants were not fully submerged, the yield was reduced by 47 % across genotypes compared with those grown under control conditions (6.1 vs. 3.3 t ha(-1)). This reduction was mainly attributed to the reduction in biomass caused by reduced light interception and leaf growth above the water. Stagnant flooding also reduced panicle number per unit area by 52 % because of reduced tillering. Shoot elongation rate kept pace with rising floodwater and correlated positively with leaf growth and biomass production. Conversely, stem non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration correlated negatively with shoot elongation rate, suggesting that fast-elongating genotypes actively consume NSCs to avoid complete submergence. Moderate shoot elongation rate strongly and positively correlated with grain yield under SF; however, elongation at rates >2.0 cm day(-1) was associated with reduced harvest index due to a smaller panicle size and increased lodging. Tolerant varieties were found to be either inherently tall or elongate moderately with rising floodwater. Our studies suggest that to improve tolerance of SF an appropriate phenotype should combine both of these traits. Fine-tuning for optimum shoot elongation with rising floodwater is, therefore, a priority for future work.
25202124	Variation in tolerance of rice to long-term stagnant flooding that submerges most of the shoot will aid in breeding tolerant cultivars.	2014	AoB Plants	Stagnant flooding (SF) is a major problem in rainfed lowlands where floodwater of 25-50 cm stagnates in the field for most of the season. We aimed to establish a system for phenotyping SF tolerance and identifying tolerant germplasm through screening of landraces. A total of 626 rice accessions were evaluated over 3 years under control conditions and two levels of SF. Floodwater was raised to 20 cm at 25 or 30 days after transplanting (DAT). In one trial, the depth was increased subsequently by 5 cm a week and in another (severe stress), it was increased to 40 cm at 37 DAT and to 50 cm at 42 DAT. In both trials, water depth was maintained at 50-60 cm until maturity. In all cases, no plant was completely submerged. Plant height, elongation rate and yield were measured at maturity. Genotypes best suited to SF showed moderate elongation of 1.3-2.3 cm day(-1) under SF. In contrast, semi-dwarf and fast-elongating types performed poorly. Subsequent trials using 18 genotypes, including six pairs of near isogenic lines (NILs) with or without SUB1 showed that all SUB1 NILs were sensitive to SF. Five of the other six genotypes contained SUB1 and were SF tolerant, suggesting the possibility of combining tolerances to complete submergence (SUB1) and SF. Stem starch and soluble sugar concentrations were similar under control conditions among the 18 genotypes, but starch was depleted by 37 % under SF, with less depletion in tolerant genotypes. SUB1 NILs contained similar concentrations of starch and sugars under SF. We conclude that survival and yield under SF are dependent on moderate elongation, high tillering, lesser carbohydrate depletion and higher fertility. The tolerant genotypes identified here performed strongly in both wet and dry seasons and will be used to identify tolerance mechanisms and alleles for use in marker-assisted breeding.
25239066	Cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid stimulates rice defense response to a piercing-sucking insect.	2014	Mol Plant	The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is a destructive, monophagous, piercing-sucking insect pest of rice. Previous studies indicated that jasmonic acid (JA) positively regulates rice defense against chewing insect pests but negatively regulates it against the piercing-sucking insect of BPH. We here demonstrated that overexpression of allene oxide cyclase (AOC) but not OPR3 (cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) reductase 3, an enzyme adjacent to AOC in the JA synthetic pathway) significantly increased rice resistance to BPH, mainly by reducing the feeding activity and survival rate. Further analysis revealed that plant response to BPH under AOC overexpression was independent of the JA pathway and that significantly higher OPDA levels stimulated rice resistance to BPH. Microarray analysis identified multiple candidate resistance-related genes under AOC overexpression. OPDA treatment stimulated the resistance of radish seedlings to green peach aphid Myzus persicae, another piercing-sucking insect. These results imply that rice resistance to chewing insects and to sucking insects can be enhanced simultaneously through AOC-mediated increases of JA and OPDA and provide direct evidence of the potential application of OPDA in stimulating plant defense responses to piercing-sucking insect pests in agriculture.
25286109	Genetic differentiation revealed by selective loci of drought-responding EST-SSRs between upland and lowland rice in China.	2014	PLoS One	Upland and lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) represent two of the most important rice ecotypes adapted to ago-ecosystems with contrasting soil-water conditions. Upland rice, domesticated in the water-limited environment, contains valuable drought-resistant characters that can be used in water-saving breeding. Knowledge about the divergence between upland and lowland rice will provide valuable cues for the evolution of drought-resistance in rice. Genetic differentiation between upland and lowland rice was explored by 47 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) located in drought responding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) among 377 rice landraces. The morphological traits of drought-resistance were evaluated in the field experiments. Different outlier loci were detected in the japonica and indica subspecies, respectively. Considerable genetic differentiation between upland and lowland rice on these outlier loci was estimated in japonica (Fst = 0.258) and indica (Fst = 0.127). Furthermore, populations of the upland and lowland ecotypes were clustered separately on these outlier loci. A significant correlation between genetic distance matrices and the dissimilarity matrices of drought-resistant traits was determined, indicating a certain relationship between the upland-lowland rice differentiation and the drought-resistance. Divergent selections occur between upland and lowland rice on the drought-resistance as the Qsts of some drought-resistant traits are significantly higher than the neutral Fst. In addition, the upland- and lowland-preferable alleles responded differently among ecotypes or allelic types under osmotic stress. This shows the evolutionary signature of drought resistance at the gene expression level. The findings of this study can strengthen our understanding of the evolution of drought-resistance in rice with significant implications in the improvement of rice drought-resistance.
25295980	Combining high-throughput phenotyping and genome-wide association studies to reveal natural genetic variation in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	Even as the study of plant genomics rapidly develops through the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques, traditional plant phenotyping lags far behind. Here we develop a high-throughput rice phenotyping facility (HRPF) to monitor 13 traditional agronomic traits and 2 newly defined traits during the rice growth period. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the 15 traits, we identify 141 associated loci, 25 of which contain known genes such as the Green Revolution semi-dwarf gene, SD1. Based on a performance evaluation of the HRPF and GWAS results, we demonstrate that high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to replace traditional phenotyping techniques and can provide valuable gene identification information. The combination of the multifunctional phenotyping tools HRPF and GWAS provides deep insights into the genetic architecture of important traits.
25360796	Association mapping for important agronomic traits in core collection of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with SSR markers.	2014	PLoS One	Mining elite genes within rice landraces is of importance for the improvement of cultivated rice. An association mapping for 12 agronomic traits was carried out using a core collection of rice consisting of 150 landraces (Panel 1) with 274 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and the mapping results were further verified using a Chinese national rice micro-core collection (Panel 2) and a collection from a global molecular breeding program (Panel 3). Our results showed that (1) 76 significant (P<0.05) trait-marker associations were detected using mixed linear model (MLM) within Panel 1 in two years, among which 32% were identical with previously mapped QTLs, and 11 significant associations had >10% explained ratio of genetic variation; (2) A total of seven aforementioned trait-marker associations were verified within Panel 2 and 3 when using a general linear model (GLM) and 55 SSR markers of the 76 significant trait-marker associations. However, no significant trait-marker association was found to be identical within three panels when using the MLM model; (3) several desirable alleles of the loci which showed significant trait-marker associations were identified. The research provided important information for further mining these elite genes within rice landraces and using them for rice breeding.
25326901	Cellular localization and detergent dependent oligomerization of rice allene oxide synthase-1.	2015	J Plant Res	Allene oxide synthase-1 from Oryza sativa (OsAOS1) localizes to the chloroplast, but lacks a putative chloroplast targeting sequence typically found in dicot AOS. Here, kinetic parameters and the oligomerization state/subunit composition of OsAOS1 were characterized in vitro in the absence or presence of detergent micelles. The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of OsAOS1 reached a maximum near the critical micelle concentration for polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether. Native gel analysis showed that OsAOS1 exists as a multimer in the absence of detergent micelles. The multimeric form of OsAOS1 was stably cross-linked in the absence of detergents, while only monomeric OsAOS1 was detected in the presence of detergent micelles. Gel filtration analysis indicated that the oligomeric state of OsAOS1 depends strongly on the detergents and that the monomer becomes the predominant form in the presence of detergent micelles. These data suggest that the detergent-dependent oligomeric state of OsAOS1 is an important factor for the regulation of its catalytic efficiency.
25378689	Whole-genome analysis of herbicide-tolerant mutant rice generated by Agrobacterium-mediated gene targeting.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Gene targeting (GT) is a technique used to modify endogenous genes in target genomes precisely via homologous recombination (HR). Although GT plants are produced using genetic transformation techniques, if the difference between the endogenous and the modified gene is limited to point mutations, GT crops can be considered equivalent to non-genetically modified mutant crops generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques. However, it is difficult to guarantee the non-incorporation of DNA fragments from Agrobacterium in GT plants created by Agrobacterium-mediated GT despite screening with conventional Southern blot and/or PCR techniques. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of herbicide-tolerant rice plants generated by inducing point mutations in the rice ALS gene via Agrobacterium-mediated GT. We performed genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array analysis and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate the molecular composition of GT rice plants. Thus far, no integration of Agrobacterium-derived DNA fragments has been detected in GT rice plants. However, >1,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion (InDels) were found in GT plants. Among these mutations, 20-100 variants might have some effect on expression levels and/or protein function. Information about additive mutations should be useful in clearing out unwanted mutations by backcrossing.
25432597	Identification of candidate genes, regions and markers for pre-harvest sprouting resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat grain leads to a reduction in grain yield and quality. The availability of markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of PHS resistance will serve to enhance breeding selection and advancement of lines for cultivar development. The aim of this study was to identify candidate regions and develop molecular markers for PHS resistance in wheat. This was achieved via high density mapping of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from an Illumina 90 K Infinium Custom Beadchip in a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from a RL4452/'AC Domain' cross and subsequent detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PHS related traits (falling number [FN], germination index [GI] and sprouting index [SI]). SNP marker sequences flanking QTL were used to locate colinear regions in Brachypodium and rice, and identify genic markers associated with PHS resistance that can be utilized for MAS in wheat.

RESULTS: A linkage map spanning 2569.4 cM was constructed with a total of 12,201 SNP, simple sequence repeat (SSR), diversity arrays technology (DArT) and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. QTL analyses using Multiple Interval Mapping (MIM) identified four QTL for PHS resistance traits on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D. Sequences of SNPs flanking these QTL were subject to a BLASTN search on the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) database (http://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository). Best survey sequence hits were subject to a BLASTN search on Gramene (www.gramene.org) against both Brachypodium and rice databases, and candidate genes and regions for PHS resistance were identified. A total of 18 SNP flanking sequences on chromosomes 3B, 4A, 7B and 7D were converted to KASP markers and validated with matching genotype calls of Infinium SNP data.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified candidate genes involved in abscissic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism, and flowering time in four genomic regions of Brachypodium and rice respectively, in addition to 18 KASP markers for PHS resistance in wheat. These markers can be deployed in future genetic studies of PHS resistance and might also be useful in the evaluation of PHS in germplasm and breeding material.
25429024	Hybrid breakdown caused by epistasis-based recessive incompatibility in a cross of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	None	J Hered	Viability and fertility in organisms depend on epistatic interactions between loci maintained in lineages. Here, we describe reduced fitness of segregants (hybrid breakdown, HB) that emerged in an F2 population derived from a cross between 2 rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, "Tachisugata" (TS) and "Hokuriku 193" (H193), despite both parents and F1s showing normal fitness. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses detected 13 QTLs for 4 morphological traits associated with the HB and 6 associated with principal component scores calculated from values of the morphological traits in the F2 population. Two-way analysis of variance of the putative QTLs identified 4 QTL pairs showing significant epistasis; among them, a pair on chromosomes 1 and 12 made the greatest contribution to HB. The finding was supported by genetic experiments using F3 progeny. HB emerged only when a plant was homozygous for the TS allele at the QTL on chromosome 1 and homozygous for the H193 allele at the QTL on chromosome 12, indicating that each allele behaves as recessive to the other. Our results support the idea that epistasis is an essential part of hybrid fitness.

25423588	De novo assembly and characterization of the transcriptome of seagrass Zostera marina using Illumina paired-end sequencing.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The seagrass Zostera marina is a monocotyledonous angiosperm belonging to a polyphyletic group of plants that can live submerged in marine habitats. Zostera marina L. is one of the most common seagrasses and is considered a cornerstone of marine plant molecular ecology research and comparative studies. However, the mechanisms underlying its adaptation to the marine environment still remain poorly understood due to limited transcriptomic and genomic data.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we explored the transcriptome of Z. marina leaves under different environmental conditions using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 55 million sequencing reads were obtained, representing 58,457 transcripts that correspond to 24,216 unigenes. A total of 14,389 (59.41%) unigenes were annotated by blast searches against the NCBI non-redundant protein database. 45.18% and 46.91% of the unigenes had significant similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database and Pfam database, respectively. Among these, 13,897 unigenes were assigned to 57 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 4,745 unigenes were identified and mapped to 233 pathways via functional annotation against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database (KEGG). We compared the orthologous gene family of the Z. marina transcriptome to Oryza sativa and Pyropia yezoensis and 11,667 orthologous gene families are specific to Z. marina. Furthermore, we identified the photoreceptors sensing red/far-red light and blue light. Also, we identified a large number of genes that are involved in ion transporters and channels including Na+ efflux, K+ uptake, Cl- channels, and H+ pumping.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study contains an extensive sequencing and gene-annotation analysis of Z. marina. This information represents a genetic resource for the discovery of genes related to light sensing and salt tolerance in this species. Our transcriptome can be further utilized in future studies on molecular adaptation to abiotic stress in Z. marina.
25505850	Proteomic analysis of seed storage proteins in wild rice species of the Oryza genus.	2014	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: The total protein contents of rice seeds are significantly higher in the three wild rice species (Oryza rufipogon Grill., Oryza officinalis Wall. and Oryza meyeriana Baill.) than in the cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, there is still no report regarding a systematic proteomic analysis of seed proteins in the wild rice species. Also, the relationship between the contents of seed total proteins and rice nutritional quality has not been thoroughly investigated.

RESULTS: The total seed protein contents, especially the glutelin contents, of the three wild rice species were higher than those of the two cultivated rice materials. Based on the protein banding patterns of SDS-PAGE, O. rufipogon was similar to the two cultivated rice materials, followed by O. officinalis, while O. meyeriana exhibited notable differences. Interestingly, O. meyeriana had high contents of glutelin and low contents of prolamine, and lacked 26 kDa globulin band and appeared a new 28 kDa protein band. However, for O. officinali a 16 kDa protein band was absent and a row of unique 32 kDa proteins appeared. In addition, we found that 13 kDa prolamine band disappeared while special 14 kDa and 12 kDa protein bands were present in O. officinalis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis revealed remarkable differences in protein profiles of the wild rice species and the two cultivated rice materials. Also, the numbers of detected protein spots of the three wild rice species were significantly higher than those of two cultivated rice. A total of 35 differential protein spots were found for glutelin acidic subunits, glutelin precursors and glutelin basic subunits in wild rice species. Among those, 18 protein spots were specific and 17 major spots were elevated. Six differential protein spots for glutelin acidic subunits were identified, including a glutelin type-A 2 precursor and five hypothetical proteins.

CONCLUSION: This was the first report on proteomic analysis of the three wild rice species. Overall results suggest that there were many new types of glutelin subunits and precursor in the three wild rice species. Hence, wild rice species are important genetic resources for improving nutritional quality to rice.
25522807	Identification of the region of rice 13 kDa prolamin essential for the formation of ER-derived protein bodies using a heterologous expression system.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Cereal prolamins, which are alcohol-soluble seed storage proteins, can induce ER-derived protein bodies (PBs) in heterologous tissue. Like maize and wheat prolamins, rice prolamins can form ER-derived PBs, but the region of mature polypeptides that is essential for PB formation has not been identified. In this study, we examined the formation mechanisms of ER-derived PB-like structures by expressing rice 13 kDa prolamin-deletion mutants fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in heterologous tissues such as yeast. The 13 kDa prolamin-GFP fusion protein was stably accumulated in transgenic yeast and formed an ER-derived PB-like structure. In contrast, rice α-globulin-GFP fusion protein was transported to vacuoles. In addition, the middle and COOH-terminal regions of 13 kDa prolamin formed ER-derived PB-like structures, whereas the NH2-terminal region of 13 kDa prolamin did not form such structures. These results suggest that the middle and COOH-terminal regions of 13 kDa prolamin can be retained and thus can induce ER-derived PB in yeast.
25265195	Comparative metabolite profiling of two rice genotypes with contrasting salt stress tolerance at the seedling stage.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Rice is sensitive to salt stress, especially at the seedling stage, with rice varieties differing remarkably in salt tolerance (ST). To understand the physiological mechanisms of ST, we investigated salt stress responses at the metabolite level.

METHODS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to profile metabolite changes in the salt-tolerant line FL478 and the sensitive variety IR64 under a salt-stress time series. Additionally, several physiological traits related to ST were investigated.

RESULTS: We characterized 92 primary metabolites in the leaves and roots of the two genotypes under stress and control conditions. The metabolites were temporally, tissue-specifically and genotype-dependently regulated under salt stress. Sugars and amino acids (AAs) increased significantly in the leaves and roots of both genotypes, while organic acids (OAs) increased in roots and decreased in leaves. Compared with IR64, FL478 experienced greater increases in sugars and AAs and more pronounced decreases in OAs in both tissues; additionally, the maximum change in sugars and AAs occurred later, while OAs changed earlier. Moreover, less Na+ and higher relative water content were observed in FL478. Eleven metabolites, including AAs and sugars, were specifically increased in FL478 over the course of the treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic responses of rice to salt stress are dynamic and involve many metabolites. The greater ST of FL478 is due to different adaptive reactions at different stress times. At early salt-stress stages, FL478 adapts to stress by decreasing OA levels or by quickly depressing growth; during later stages, more metabolites are accumulated, thereby serving as compatible solutes against osmotic challenge induced by salt stress.
25335927	Statistical inference of selection and divergence of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta.	2014	G3 (Bethesda)	The resistance gene Pi-ta has been effectively used to control rice blast disease, but some populations of cultivated and wild rice have evolved resistance. Insights into the evolutionary processes that led to this resistance during crop domestication may be inferred from the population history of domesticated and wild rice strains. In this study, we applied a recently developed statistical method, time-dependent Poisson random field model, to examine the evolution of the Pi-ta gene in cultivated and weedy rice. Our study suggests that the Pi-ta gene may have more recently introgressed into cultivated rice, indica and japonica, and U.S. weedy rice from the wild species, O. rufipogon. In addition, the Pi-ta gene is under positive selection in japonica, tropical japonica, U.S. cultivars and U.S. weedy rice. We also found that sequences of two domains of the Pi-ta gene, the nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat domain, are highly conserved among all rice accessions examined. Our results provide a valuable analytical tool for understanding the evolution of disease resistance genes in crop plants.
25547027	Genetic relatedness among indigenous rice varieties in the Eastern Himalayan region based on nucleotide sequences of the Waxy gene.	2014	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: Indigenous rice varieties in the Eastern Himalayan region of Northeast India are traditionally classified into sali, boro and jum ecotypes based on geographical locality and the season of cultivation. In this study, we used DNA sequence data from the Waxy (Wx) gene to infer the genetic relatedness among indigenous rice varieties in Northeast India and to assess the genetic distinctiveness of ecotypes.

FINDINGS: The results of all three analyses (Bayesian, Maximum Parsimony and Neighbor Joining) were congruent and revealed two genetically distinct clusters of rice varieties in the region. The large group comprised several varieties of sali and boro ecotypes, and all agronomically improved varieties. The small group consisted of only traditionally cultivated indigenous rice varieties, which included one boro, few sali and all jum varieties. The fixation index analysis revealed a very low level of differentiation between sali and boro (F(ST) = 0.005), moderate differentiation between sali and jum (F(ST) = 0.108) and high differentiation between jum and boro (F(ST) = 0.230) ecotypes.

CONCLUSION: The genetic relatedness analyses revealed that sali, boro and jum ecotypes are genetically heterogeneous, and the current classification based on cultivation type is not congruent with the genetic background of rice varieties. Indigenous rice varieties chosen from genetically distinct clusters could be used in breeding programs to improve genetic gain through heterosis, while maintaining high genetic diversity.
25536503	Dynamic quantitative trait locus analysis of seed vigor at three maturity stages in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Seed vigor is an important characteristic of seed quality. In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of seed vigor, including the germination potential, germination rate, germination index and time for 50% of germination, at 4 (early), 5 (middle) and 6 weeks (late) after heading in two years. A total of 24 additive and 9 epistatic quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed vigor were identified using QTL Cartographer and QTLNetwork program respectively in 2012; while 32 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers associated with seed vigor were detected using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) in 2013. The additive, epistatic and QTL × development interaction effects regulated the dry maturity developmental process to improve seed vigor in rice. The phenotypic variation explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL × development interaction ranged from 5.86 to 40.67%, 4.64 to 11.28% and 0.01 to 1.17%, respectively. The QTLs were rarely co-localized among the different maturity stages; more QTLs were expressed at the early maturity stage followed by the late and middle stages. Twenty additive QTLs were stably expressed in two years which might play important roles in establishment of seed vigor in different environments. By comparing chromosomal positions of these stably expressed additive QTLs with those previously identified, the regions of QTL for seed vigor are likely to coincide with QTL for grain size, low temperature germinability and seed dormancy; while 5 additive QTL might represent novel genes. Using four selected RILs, three cross combinations of seed vigor for the development of RIL populations were predicted; 19 elite alleles could be pyramided by each combination.
20637108	Protein phosphatase complement in rice: genome-wide identification and transcriptional analysis under abiotic stress conditions and reproductive development.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Protein phosphatases are the key components of a number of signaling pathways where they modulate various cellular responses. In plants, protein phosphatases constitute a large gene family and are reportedly involved in the regulation of abiotic stress responses and plant development. Recently, the whole complement of protein phosphatases has been identified in Arabidopsis genome. While PP2C class of serine/threonine phosphatases has been explored in rice, the whole complement of this gene family is yet to be reported.

RESULTS: In silico investigation revealed the presence of 132-protein phosphatase-coding genes in rice genome. Domain analysis and phylogenetic studies of evolutionary relationship categorized these genes into PP2A, PP2C, PTP, DSP and LMWP classes. PP2C class represents a major proportion of this gene family with 90 members. Chromosomal localization revealed their distribution on all the 12 chromosomes, with 42 genes being present on segmentally duplicated regions and 10 genes on tandemly duplicated regions of chromosomes. The expression profiles of 128 genes under salinity, cold and drought stress conditions, 11 reproductive developmental (panicle and seed) stages along with three stages of vegetative development were analyzed using microarray expression data. 46 genes were found to be differentially expressing in 3 abiotic stresses out of which 31 were up-regulated and 15 exhibited down-regulation. A total of 82 genes were found to be differentially expressing in different developmental stages. An overlapping expression pattern was found for abiotic stresses and reproductive development, wherein 8 genes were up-regulated and 7 down-regulated. Expression pattern of the 13 selected genes was validated employing real time PCR, and it was found to be in accordance with the microarray expression data for most of the genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Exploration of protein phosphatase gene family in rice has resulted in the identification of 132 members, which can be further divided into different classes phylogenetically. Expression profiling and analysis indicate the involvement of this large gene family in a number of signaling pathways triggered by abiotic stresses and their possible role in plant development. Our study will provide the platform from where; the expression pattern information can be transformed into molecular, cellular and biochemical characterization of members belonging to this gene family.
19825577	The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (OsRLCK) gene family in rice: organization, phylogenetic relationship, and expression during development and stress.	2008	Mol Plant	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) in plants belong to the super family of receptor-like kinases (RLKs). These proteins show homology to RLKs in kinase domain but lack the transmembrane domain. Some of the functionally characterized RLCKs from plants have been shown to play roles in development and stress responses. Previously, 149 and 187 RLCK encoding genes were identified from Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. By using HMM-based domain structure and phylogenetic relationships, we have identified 379 OsRLCKs from rice. OsRLCKs are distributed on all 12 chromosomes of rice and some members are located on duplicated chromosomal segments. Several OsRLCKs probably also undergo alternative splicing, some having evidence only in the form of gene models. To understand their possible functions, expression patterns during landmark stages of vegetative and reproductive development as well as abiotic and biotic stress using microarray and MPSS-based data were analyzed. Real-time PCR-based expression profiling for a selected few genes confirmed the outcome of microarray analysis. Differential expression patterns observed for majority of OsRLCKs during development and stress suggest their involvement in diverse functions in rice. Majority of the stress-responsive OsRLCKs were also found to be localized within mapped regions of abiotic stress QTLs. Outcome of this study would help in selecting organ/development stage specific OsRLCK genes/targets for functional validation studies.
11283343	Gene expression profiles during the initial phase of salt stress in rice.	2001	Plant Cell	Transcript regulation in response to high salinity was investigated for salt-tolerant rice (var Pokkali) with microarrays including 1728 cDNAs from libraries of salt-stressed roots. NaCl at 150 mM reduced photosynthesis to one tenth of the prestress value within minutes. Hybridizations of RNA to microarray slides probed for changes in transcripts from 15 min to 1 week after salt shock. Beginning 15 min after the shock, Pokkali showed upregulation of transcripts. Approximately 10% of the transcripts in Pokkali were significantly upregulated or downregulated within 1 hr of salt stress. The initial differences between control and stressed plants continued for hours but became less pronounced as the plants adapted over time. The interpretation of an adaptive process was supported by the similar analysis of salinity-sensitive rice (var IR29), in which the immediate response exhibited by Pokkali was delayed and later resulted in downregulation of transcription and death. The upregulated functions observed with Pokkali at different time points during stress adaptation changed over time. Increased protein synthesis and protein turnover were observed at early time points, followed by the induction of known stress-responsive transcripts within hours, and the induction of transcripts for defense-related functions later. After 1 week, the nature of upregulated transcripts (e.g., aquaporins) indicated recovery.
15111723	The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Although the discovery of aquaporins in plants has resulted in a paradigm shift in the understanding of plant water relations, the relationship between aquaporins and drought resistance still remains elusive. From an agronomic viewpoint, upland rice is traditionally considered as showing drought avoidance. In the investigation of different morphological and physiological responses of upland rice (Oryza sativa L. spp indica cv. Zhonghan 3) and lowland rice (O. sativa L. spp japonica cv. Xiushui 63) to water deficit, we observed young leaf rolling and the remarkable decline of cumulative transpiration in the upland rice. The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in lowland rice. Protein levels were increased in upland rice and decreased in lowland rice at 10 h after the water deficit. The up-regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance. The physiological significance of this RWC3 up-regulation was then explored with the over-expression of RWC3 in transgenic lowland rice (O. sativa L. spp japonica cv. Zhonghua 11) controlled by a stress-inducible SWPA2 promoter. Compared to the wild-type plant, the transgenic lowland rice exhibited higher root osmotic hydraulic conductivity (Lp), leaf water potential and relative cumulative transpiration at the end of 10 h PEG treatment. These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice.
20107517	DEP and AFO regulate reproductive habit in rice.	2010	PLoS Genet	Sexual reproduction is essential for the life cycle of most angiosperms. However, pseudovivipary is an important reproductive strategy in some grasses. In this mode of reproduction, asexual propagules are produced in place of sexual reproductive structures. However, the molecular mechanism of pseudovivipary still remains a mystery. In this work, we found three naturally occurring mutants in rice, namely, phoenix (pho), degenerative palea (dep), and abnormal floral organs (afo). Genetic analysis of them indicated that the stable pseudovivipary mutant pho was a double mutant containing both a Mendelian mutation in DEP and a non-Mendelian mutation in AFO. Further map-based cloning and microarray analysis revealed that dep mutant was caused by a genetic alteration in OsMADS15 while afo was caused by an epigenetic mutation in OsMADS1. Thus, OsMADS1 and OsMADS15 are both required to ensure sexual reproduction in rice and mutations of them lead to the switch of reproductive habit from sexual to asexual in rice. For the first time, our results reveal two regulators for sexual and asexual reproduction modes in flowering plants. In addition, our findings also make it possible to manipulate the reproductive strategy of plants, at least in rice.
17409064	Divergent regulatory OsMADS2 functions control size, shape and differentiation of the highly derived rice floret second-whorl organ.	2007	Genetics	Functional diversification of duplicated genes can contribute to the emergence of new organ morphologies. Model eudicot plants like Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus have a single PI/GLO gene that together with AP3/DEF regulate petal and stamen formation. Lodicules of grass flowers are morphologically distinct reduced organs occupying the position of petals in other flowers. They serve a distinct function in partial and transient flower opening to allow stamen emergence and cross-pollination. Grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes and in rice (Oryza sativa) one these genes, OsMADS2, controls lodicule formation without affecting stamen development. In this study, we investigate the mechanistic roles played by OsMADS2. We ascribe a function for OsMADS2 in controlling cell division and differentiation along the proximal-distal axis. OsMADS2 is required to trigger parenchymatous and lodicule-specific vascular development while maintaining a small organ size. Our data implicate the developmentally late spatially restricted accumulation of OsMADS2 transcripts in the differentiating lodicule to control growth of these regions. The global architecture of transcripts regulated by OsMADS2 gives insights into the regulation of cell division and vascular differentiation that together can form this highly modified grass organ with important functions in floret opening and stamen emergence independent of the paralogous gene OsMADS4.
14704206	Double-stranded RNA interference of a rice PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS2, uncovers its second-whorl-specific function in floral organ patterning.	2003	Genetics	Unlike many eudicot species, grasses have duplicated PI/GLO-like genes. Functional analysis of one of the rice PI/GLO paralogs, OsMADS2, is reported here. Our data demonstrate its essential role in lodicule development and implicate the second PI/GLO paralog, OsMADS4, to suffice for stamen specification. We provide the first evidence for differential contributions of grass PI/GLO paralogs in patterning second- and third-whorl floral organs.
20197292	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2.	2010	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Under conditions of low iron availability, rice plants induce genes involved in iron uptake and utilization. The iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element binding factors 1 and 2 (IDEF1 and IDEF2) regulate transcriptional response to iron deficiency in rice roots. Clarification of the functions of IDEF1 and IDEF2 could uncover the gene regulation mechanism.

METHODS: Spatial patterns of IDEF1 and IDEF2 expression were analysed by histochemical staining of IDEF1 and IDEF2 promoter-GUS transgenic rice lines. Expression patterns of the target genes of IDEF1 and IDEF2 were analysed using transformants with induced or repressed expression of IDEF1 or IDEF2 grown in iron-rich or in iron-deficient solutions for 1 d.

KEY RESULTS: IDEF1 and IDEF2 were highly expressed in the basal parts of the lateral roots and vascular bundles. IDEF1 and IDEF2 expression was dominant in leaf mesophyll and vascular cells, respectively. These expression patterns were similar under both iron-deficient and iron-sufficient conditions. IDEF1 was strongly expressed in pollen, ovaries, the aleurone layer and embryo. IDEF2 was expressed in pollen, ovaries and the dorsal vascular region of the endosperm. During seed germination, IDEF1 and IDEF2 were expressed in the endosperm and embryo. Expression of IDEF1 target genes was regulated in iron-rich roots similar to early iron-deficiency stages. In addition, the expression patterns of IDEF2 target genes were similar between iron-rich conditions and early or subsequent iron deficiency.

CONCLUSIONS: IDEF1 and IDEF2 are constitutively expressed during both vegetative and reproductive stages. The spatial expression patterns of IDEF1 and IDEF2 overlap with their target genes in restricted cell types, but not in all cells. The spatial expression patterns and gene regulation of IDEF1 and IDEF2 in roots are generally conserved under conditions of iron sufficiency and deficiency, suggesting complicated interactions with unknown factors for sensing and transmitting iron-deficiency signals.
16381838	The tmRDB and SRPDB resources.	2006	Nucleic Acids Res	Maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, the tmRNA database (tmRDB) is accessible at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html with mirror sites located at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama (http://www.ag.auburn.edu/mirror/tmRDB/) and the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Denmark (http://tmrdb.kvl.dk/). The signal recognition particle database (SRPDB) at http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html is mirrored at http://srpdb.kvl.dk/ and the University of Goteborg (http://bio.lundberg.gu.se/dbs/SRPDB/SRPDB.html). The databases assist in investigations of the tmRNP (a ribonucleoprotein complex which liberates stalled bacterial ribosomes) and the SRP (a particle which recognizes signal sequences and directs secretory proteins to cell membranes). The curated tmRNA and SRP RNA alignments consider base pairs supported by comparative sequence analysis. Also shown are alignments of the tmRNA-associated proteins SmpB, ribosomal protein S1, alanyl-tRNA synthetase and Elongation Factor Tu, as well as the SRP proteins SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54 (Ffh), SRP68, SRP72, cpSRP43, Flhf, SRP receptor (alpha) and SRP receptor (beta). All alignments can be easily examined using a new exploratory browser. The databases provide links to high-resolution structures and serve as depositories for structures obtained by molecular modeling.
25329378	Direct chloroplast sequencing: comparison of sequencing platforms and analysis tools for whole chloroplast barcoding.	2014	PLoS One	Direct sequencing of total plant DNA using next generation sequencing technologies generates a whole chloroplast genome sequence that has the potential to provide a barcode for use in plant and food identification. Advances in DNA sequencing platforms may make this an attractive approach for routine plant identification. The HiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent (Life Technology) sequencing platforms were used to sequence total DNA from rice to identify polymorphisms in the whole chloroplast genome sequence of a wild rice plant relative to cultivated rice (cv. Nipponbare). Consensus chloroplast sequences were produced by mapping sequence reads to the reference rice chloroplast genome or by de novo assembly and mapping of the resulting contigs to the reference sequence. A total of 122 polymorphisms (SNPs and indels) between the wild and cultivated rice chloroplasts were predicted by these different sequencing and analysis methods. Of these, a total of 102 polymorphisms including 90 SNPs were predicted by both platforms. Indels were more variable with different sequencing methods, with almost all discrepancies found in homopolymers. The Ion Torrent platform gave no apparent false SNP but was less reliable for indels. The methods should be suitable for routine barcoding using appropriate combinations of sequencing platform and data analysis.
23894646	Evolution of chloroplast J proteins.	2013	PLoS One	Hsp70 chaperones are involved in multiple biological processes and are recruited to specific processes by designated J domain-containing cochaperones, or J proteins. To understand the evolution and functions of chloroplast Hsp70s and J proteins, we identified the Arabidopsis chloroplast J protein constituency using a combination of genomic and proteomic database searches and individual protein import assays. We show that Arabidopsis chloroplasts have at least 19 J proteins, the highest number of confirmed J proteins for any organelle. These 19 J proteins are classified into 11 clades, for which cyanobacteria and glaucophytes only have homologs for one clade, green algae have an additional three clades, and all the other 7 clades are specific to land plants. Each clade also possesses a clade-specific novel motif that is likely used to interact with different client proteins. Gene expression analyses indicate that most land plant-specific J proteins show highly variable expression in different tissues and are down regulated by low temperatures. These results show that duplication of chloroplast Hsp70 in land plants is accompanied by more than doubling of the number of its J protein cochaperones through adding new J proteins with novel motifs, not through duplications within existing families. These new J proteins likely recruit chloroplast Hsp70 to perform tissue specific functions related to biosynthesis rather than to stress resistance.
24416299	Slow co-evolution of the MAGO and Y14 protein families is required for the maintenance of their obligate heterodimerization mode.	2014	PLoS One	The exon junction complex (EJC) plays important roles in RNA metabolisms and the development of eukaryotic organisms. MAGO (short form of MAGO NASHI) and Y14 (also Tsunagi or RBM8) are the EJC core components. Their biological roles have been well investigated in various species, but the evolutionary patterns of the two gene families and their protein-protein interactions are poorly known. Genome-wide survey suggested that the MAGO and Y14 two gene families originated in eukaryotic organisms with the maintenance of a low copy. We found that the two protein families evolved slowly; however, the MAGO family under stringent purifying selection evolved more slowly than the Y14 family that was under relative relaxed purifying selection. MAGO and Y14 were obliged to form heterodimer in a eukaryotic organism, and this obligate mode was plesiomorphic. Lack of binding of MAGO to Y14 as functional barrier was observed only among distantly species, suggesting that a slow co-evolution of the two protein families. Inter-protein co-evolutionary signal was further quantified in analyses of the Tol-MirroTree and co-evolution analysis using protein sequences. About 20% of the 41 significantly correlated mutation groups (involving 97 residues) predicted between the two families was clade-specific. Moreover, around half of the predicted co-evolved groups and nearly all clade-specific residues fell into the minimal interaction domains of the two protein families. The mutagenesis effects of the clade-specific residues strengthened that the co-evolution is required for obligate MAGO-Y14 heterodimerization mode. In turn, the obliged heterodimerization in an organism serves as a strong functional constraint for the co-evolution of the MAGO and Y14 families. Such a co-evolution allows maintaining the interaction between the proteins through large evolutionary time scales. Our work shed a light on functional evolution of the EJC genes in eukaryotes, and facilitates to understand the co-evolutionary processes among protein families.
14681369	The tmRNA website: reductive evolution of tmRNA in plastids and other endosymbionts.	2004	Nucleic Acids Res	tmRNA combines tRNA- and mRNA-like properties and ameliorates problems arising from stalled ribosomes. Research on the mechanism, structure and biology of tmRNA is served by the tmRNA website (http://www.indiana.edu/~ tmrna), a collection of sequences, alignments, secondary structures and other information. Because many of these sequences are not in GenBank, a BLAST server has been added; another new feature is an abbreviated alignment for the tRNA-like domain only. Many tmRNA sequences from plastids have been added, five found in public sequence data and another 10 generated by direct sequencing; detection in early-branching members of the green plastid lineage brings coverage to all three primary plastid lineages. The new sequences include the shortest known tmRNA sequence. While bacterial tmRNAs usually have a lone pseudoknot upstream of the mRNA segment and a string of three or four pseudoknots downstream, plastid tmRNAs collectively show loss of pseudoknots at both postions. The pseudoknot-string region is also too short to contain the usual pseudoknot number in another new entry, the tmRNA sequence from a bacterial endosymbiont of insect cells, Tremblaya princeps. Pseudoknots may optimize tmRNA function in free-living bacteria, yet become dispensible when the endosymbiotic lifestyle relaxes selective pressure for fast growth.
24280452	Single-feature polymorphism mapping of isogenic rice lines identifies the influence of terpene synthase on brown planthopper feeding preferences.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Bph3, a major brown planthopper (BPH) resistance locus derived from the rice cultivar Rathu Heenati (RH), has been used as a stable donor of traits that improve highly susceptible aromatic rice varieties in Thailand. Map-based cloning was initiated using a set of isogenic lines (ILs) harboring the major Bph3 locus on chromosome 6. IL genomes were scanned with a 57 K Affymetrix Rice GeneChip to identify the gene responsible for Bph3.

FINDINGS: Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) mapping was used to localize 84 candidate genes. An expression analysis of 15 selected candidate genes in the aromatic rice cultivar KDML105 (KD) and the ILs under normal conditions revealed two differentially expressed sequences. Following hopper feeding, only one candidate gene, Os04g27430, was differentially expressed. Os04g27430 encodes a putative sesquiterpene synthase (STPS) gene that was induced by BPH feeding in ILs. An antixenosis test in three selected ILs revealed a major role for STPS in insect preference during the first 120 hours of the rice-insect interaction. Functional SNPs in exon 5 that resulted in the deletion of seven amino acids in the susceptible rice line were identified. Moreover, three additional SNPs associated with three transcription binding sites were also identified, which might explain the differential response of Os04g27430 during the anti-feeding test.

CONCLUSION: Os04g27430 is the second known rice STPS induced by BPH. The gene may involve an antixenosis BPH resistance mechanism. The combination of the STPS and the Bph3 locus was more effective than Bph3 alone in the tested ILs.
21037258	miRBase: integrating microRNA annotation and deep-sequencing data.	2011	Nucleic Acids Res	miRBase is the primary online repository for all microRNA sequences and annotation. The current release (miRBase 16) contains over 15,000 microRNA gene loci in over 140 species, and over 17,000 distinct mature microRNA sequences. Deep-sequencing technologies have delivered a sharp rise in the rate of novel microRNA discovery. We have mapped reads from short RNA deep-sequencing experiments to microRNAs in miRBase and developed web interfaces to view these mappings. The user can view all read data associated with a given microRNA annotation, filter reads by experiment and count, and search for microRNAs by tissue- and stage-specific expression. These data can be used as a proxy for relative expression levels of microRNA sequences, provide detailed evidence for microRNA annotations and alternative isoforms of mature microRNAs, and allow us to revisit previous annotations. miRBase is available online at: http://www.mirbase.org/.
24690362	Cost-effective enrichment hybridization capture of chloroplast genomes at deep multiplexing levels for population genetics and phylogeography studies.	2014	Mol Ecol Resour	Biodiversity, phylogeography and population genetic studies will be revolutionized by access to large data sets thanks to next-generation sequencing methods. In this study, we develop an easy and cost-effective protocol for in-solution enrichment hybridization capture of complete chloroplast genomes applicable at deep-multiplexed levels. The protocol uses cheap in-house species-specific probes developed via long-range PCR of the entire chloroplast. Barcoded libraries are constructed, and in-solution enrichment of the chloroplasts is carried out using the probes. This protocol was tested and validated on six economically important West African crop species, namely African rice, pearl millet, three African yam species and fonio. For pearl millet, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol to retrieve 95% of the sequence of the whole chloroplast on 95 multiplexed individuals in a single MiSeq run at a success rate of 95%. This new protocol allows whole chloroplast genomes to be retrieved at a modest cost and will allow unprecedented resolution for closely related species in phylogeography studies using plastomes.

The hybridization of genomic DNA with the tRNA gene showed that there are about 10 glycine tRNA genes per diploid rice genome. The 3' and 5' internal control regions, where RNA polymerase III and transcription factors bind, were found to be present in the coding sequence. The gene was transcribed into a 4S product in an yeast cell-free extract. The substitution of 5' internal control region with analogous sequences from either M13mp19 or M13mp18 DNA did not affect the transcription of the gene in vitro. The changes in three highly conserved nucleotides in the consensus 5' internal control region (RGYNNARYGG; R = purine, Y = pyrimidine, N = any nucleotide) did not affect transcription showing that these nucleotides are not essential for promotion of transcription. There were two 16 base pair repeats, 'TGTTTGTTTCAGCTTA' at -130 and -375 positions upstream from the start of the gene. Deletion of 5' flanking sequences including the 16 base pair repeat at -375 showed increased transcription indicating that these sequences negatively modulate the expression of the gene.
25483893	Development of a general method for detection and quantification of the P35S promoter based on assessment of existing methods.	2014	Sci Rep	The Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (P35S) is a commonly used target for detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are currently 24 reported detection methods, targeting different regions of the P35S promoter. Initial assessment revealed that due to the absence of primer binding sites in the P35S sequence, 19 of the 24 reported methods failed to detect P35S in MON88913 cotton, and the other two methods could only be applied to certain GMOs. The rest three reported methods were not suitable for measurement of P35S in some testing events, because SNPs in binding sites of the primer/probe would result in abnormal amplification plots and poor linear regression parameters. In this study, we discovered a conserved region in the P35S sequence through sequencing of P35S promoters from multiple transgenic events, and developed new qualitative and quantitative detection systems targeting this conserved region. The qualitative PCR could detect the P35S promoter in 23 unique GMO events with high specificity and sensitivity. The quantitative method was suitable for measurement of P35S promoter, exhibiting good agreement between the amount of template and Ct values for each testing event. This study provides a general P35S screening method, with greater coverage than existing methods.
25162526	OSCA1 mediates osmotic-stress-evoked Ca2+ increases vital for osmosensing in Arabidopsis.	2014	Nature	Water is crucial to plant growth and development. Environmental water deficiency triggers an osmotic stress signalling cascade, which induces short-term cellular responses to reduce water loss and long-term responses to remodel the transcriptional network and physiological and developmental processes. Several signalling components that have been identified by extensive genetic screens for altered sensitivities to osmotic stress seem to function downstream of the perception of osmotic stress. It is known that hyperosmolality and various other stimuli trigger increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). Considering that in bacteria and animals osmosensing Ca(2+) channels serve as osmosensors, hyperosmolality-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases have been widely speculated to be involved in osmosensing in plants. However, the molecular nature of corresponding Ca(2+) channels remain unclear. Here we describe a hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channel and its function in osmosensing in plants. Using calcium-imaging-based unbiased forward genetic screens we isolated Arabidopsis mutants that exhibit low hyperosmolality-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. These mutants were rescreened for their cellular, physiological and developmental responses to osmotic stress, and those with clear combined phenotypes were selected for further physical mapping. One of the mutants, reduced hyperosmolality-induced [Ca(2+)]i increase 1 (osca1), displays impaired osmotic Ca(2+) signalling in guard cells and root cells, and attenuated water transpiration regulation and root growth in response to osmotic stress. OSCA1 is identified as a previously unknown plasma membrane protein and forms hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels, revealing that OSCA1 may be an osmosensor. OSCA1 represents a channel responsible for [Ca(2+)]i increases induced by a stimulus in plants, opening up new avenues for studying Ca(2+) machineries for other stimuli and providing potential molecular genetic targets for engineering drought-resistant crops.
25765449	Comparative transcriptome profiling of a rice line carrying Xa39 and its parents triggered by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae provides novel insights into the broad-spectrum hypersensitive response.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a devastating rice disease worldwide. Xa39 is a resistance (R) gene with a broad-spectrum hypersensitive response (BSHR) to Xoo. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by Xa39 remain unclear. In this study, the transcriptome profiling of a rice line carrying Xa39 and its parents at the early stage of Xoo infection were investigated.

RESULTS: A rice introgression line H471 carrying Xa39 exhibited a typical local hypersensitive response phenotype, accompanied by programmed cell death after inoculation with the Xoo Philippines' race 9b. Transcriptome profiling of H471 and its parents at 1 and 2 days post-inoculation was performed using RNA sequencing. In total, 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in H471 compared with its recurrent parent Huang-Hua-Zhan after inoculation with Xoo. Among them, 121 (39.5%) genes, with functional enrichments that were related to defense response, protein amino acid phosphorylation, and apoptosis, were found to be constitutively expressed. The other 185 (60.5%) genes, with GO terms that belonged to defense response, were significantly responsive to Xoo infection in H471. Ten up-regulated and 12 down-regulated genes encoding intracellular immune receptors were identified in H471 compared with Huang-Hua-Zhan. LOC_Os11g37759, which was located in the fine-mapping region harboring Xa39, is a Xa39 candidate gene. The putative BSHR-related co-regulatory networks were constructed using 33 DEGs from four functional groups, including gibberellic acid receptors and brassinosteroid regulators, which were differentially co-expressed with LOC_Os11g37759 in infected H471. Our results indicated that there might be cross-talk between the Xa39-mediated signal transduction cascades and the GA/BR signaling pathway, and that the defense mechanism was related to diverse kinases, transcription factors, post-translational regulation, and R genes.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the comprehensive transcriptome profile of a rice introgression line carrying Xa39 and its parents, and identifies a set of DEGs involved in BSHR mediated by Xa39. These data provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of plant disease resistance mediated by R genes, and the identified DEGs will serve as candidates for Xa39 cloning and for further understanding the molecular mechanism of BSHR.
25587002	Transposition of a rice Mutator-like element in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2015	Plant Cell	Mutator-like transposable elements (MULEs) are widespread in plants and are well known for their high transposition activity as well as their ability to duplicate and amplify host gene fragments. Despite their abundance and importance, few active MULEs have been identified. In this study, we demonstrated that a rice (Oryza sativa) MULE, Os3378, is capable of excising and reinserting in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), suggesting that yeast harbors all the host factors for the transposition of MULEs. The transposition activity induced by the wild-type transposase is low but can be altered by modification of the transposase sequence, including deletion, fusion, and substitution. Particularly, fusion of a fluorescent protein to the transposase enhanced the transposition activity, representing another approach to manipulate transposases. Moreover, we identified a critical region in the transposase where the net charge of the amino acids seems to be important for activity. Finally, transposition efficiency is also influenced by the element and its flanking sequences (i.e., small elements are more competent than their large counterparts). Perfect target site duplication is favorable, but not required, for precise excision. In addition to the potential application in functional genomics, this study provides the foundation for further studies of the transposition mechanism of MULEs.
25605935	Structure, variation, and assembly of the root-associated microbiomes of rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plants depend upon beneficial interactions between roots and microbes for nutrient availability, growth promotion, and disease suppression. High-throughput sequencing approaches have provided recent insights into root microbiomes, but our current understanding is still limited relative to animal microbiomes. Here we present a detailed characterization of the root-associated microbiomes of the crop plant rice by deep sequencing, using plants grown under controlled conditions as well as field cultivation at multiple sites. The spatial resolution of the study distinguished three root-associated compartments, the endosphere (root interior), rhizoplane (root surface), and rhizosphere (soil close to the root surface), each of which was found to harbor a distinct microbiome. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, microbiome composition varied with soil source and genotype. In field conditions, geographical location and cultivation practice, namely organic vs. conventional, were factors contributing to microbiome variation. Rice cultivation is a major source of global methane emissions, and methanogenic archaea could be detected in all spatial compartments of field-grown rice. The depth and scale of this study were used to build coabundance networks that revealed potential microbial consortia, some of which were involved in methane cycling. Dynamic changes observed during microbiome acquisition, as well as steady-state compositions of spatial compartments, support a multistep model for root microbiome assembly from soil wherein the rhizoplane plays a selective gating role. Similarities in the distribution of phyla in the root microbiomes of rice and other plants suggest that conclusions derived from this study might be generally applicable to land plants.
25447912	RNA-Seq analysis of differentially expressed genes in rice under varied nitrogen supplies.	2015	Gene	Ammonium is the main inorganic nitrogen source in paddy soil. Rice (Oryza sativa), an ammonium-preferring and -tolerant grain crop, is a valuable resource for researching ammonium-uptake mechanism and understanding the molecular networks that the plant copes with ammonium variation. To generate a broad survey of early responses affected by varied ammonium supplies in rice, RNA samples were prepared from the roots and shoots of rice plants subjected to nitrogen-free (0mM ammonium), 1mM ammonium and high ammonium (10mM ammonium) for a short period of 4h (1mM ammonium treatment as the control), respectively, and the transcripts were sequenced using the Illumina/HiSeq™ 2000 RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) platform. By comparative analysis, 394 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in roots, among which, 143 and 251 DEGs were up- and down-regulated under nitrogen-free condition, respectively. In shoots, 468 (119 up-regulated/349 down-regulated) DEGs were found under such condition. However, with high ammonium treatment, only 63 genes (6 up-regulated/57 down-regulated) in roots and 115 genes in shoots (93 up-regulated/22 down-regulated) were differentially expressed. According to KEGG analysis, when exposed to nitrogen-free condition, DEGs participating in the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms were down-regulated (with 1 exception) in roots as well as in shoots, implying reduced carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolisms. Under high ammonium supply, all DEGs associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms were down-regulated in roots and to the contrary, up-regulated in shoots. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, NAD(+)) [EC: 1.2.1.3] seemed to have played an important role in rice shoots under high ammonium condition, analysis results implicated a coordinative regulation of carbohydrate with amino acid metabolisms under nitrogen deficiency as well as the high ammonium conditions during a short period of several hours in rice. Moreover, transcripts with abundance variation might be precious gene resources in responding to different ammonium supplies in rice.
25445270	Synergistic regulatory networks mediated by microRNAs and transcription factors under drought, heat and salt stresses in Oryza Sativa spp.	2015	Gene	BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are primary gene regulators within the cell. Regulatory mechanisms of these two main regulators are of great interest to biologists and may provide insights into the abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the interaction between miRNAs and TFs in a gene regulatory network (GRN) still remains uncovered. Previous research has been mostly directed at inferring either miRNA or TF regulatory networks from data. However, networks involving a single type of regulator may not fully reveal the complex gene regulatory mechanisms, therefore study of interplay among these two regulators in gene regulation is important towards explaining the mechanism of different abiotic stresses.

RESULT: Oligonucleotide microarrays containing 51,279 transcripts were used to identify total 133 salt responsive target genes regulated by 11 TFs that are also differentially regulated by miRNA under salinity, heat and drought stresses in Oryza sativa. TF's-target interactions which are most enriched in their downstream regulation were also identified. Many genes whose encoded proteins are implicated in response to light and radiation stimulus, hormone stimuli, oxidative stress, copper ion binding and electron transport were found to be enriched. However the majority were novel for the combined abiotic stress, which indicates that there are a great number of genes induced after the exposure these abiotic stresses and regulated by miRNA.

CONCLUSION: Analysis of the expression profile data of Oryza provides clues regarding some putative cellular and molecular processes that are undertaken in response to these stresses. The study also identified a large number of candidate functional genes that appear to be constitutively involved in salt, drought and heat stresses tolerance. Further examination of these genes may enable the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance in Oryza, to be elucidated.
25445269	The genetic and molecular origin of natural variation for the fragrance trait in an elite Malaysian aromatic rice through quantitative trait loci mapping using SSR and gene-based markers.	2015	Gene	MRQ74, a popular aromatic Malaysian landrace, allows for charging considerably higher prices than non-aromatic landraces. Thus, breeding this profitable trait has become a priority for Malaysian rice breeding. Despite many studies on aroma genetics, ambiguities considering its genetic basis remain. It has been observed that identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) based on anchor markers, particularly candidate genes controlling a trait of interest, can increase the power of QTL detection. Hence, this study aimed to locate QTLs that influence natural variations in rice scent using microsatellites and candidate gene-based sequence polymorphisms. For this purpose, an F2 mapping population including 189 individual plants was developed by MRQ74 crosses with 'MR84', a non-scented Malaysian accession. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative approaches were applied to obtain a phenotype data framework. Consequently, we identified two QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 8. These QTLs explained from 3.2% to 39.3% of the total fragrance phenotypic variance. In addition, we could resolve linkage group 8 by adding six gene-based primers in the interval harboring the most robust QTL. Hence, we could locate a putative fgr allele in the QTL found on chromosome 8 in the interval RM223-SCU015RM (1.63cM). The identified QTLs represent an important step toward recognition of the rice flavor genetic control mechanism. In addition, this identification will likely accelerate the progress of the use of molecular markers for gene isolation, gene-based cloning, and marker-assisted selection breeding programs aimed at improving rice cultivars.
25447922	A rice DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, OsRH17, suppresses 16S ribosomal RNA maturation in Escherichia coli.	2015	Gene	DEAD-box proteins comprise a large protein family. These proteins function in all types of processes in RNA metabolism and are highly conserved among eukaryotes. However, the precise functions of DEAD-box proteins in rice physiology and development remain unclear. In this study, we identified a rice DEAD-box protein, OsRH17, that contains a DEAD domain and all of the common conserved motifs of DEAD-box RNA helicases. OsRH17 was specifically expressed in pollen and differentiated callus and upregulated by application of the plant hormones naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The OsRH17:GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. Tiny amounts of OsRH17 and partial fragments (N-427 and C-167) were detected when they were expressed in Escherichia coli, a prokaryote. Growth of the host cells was suppressed in E. coli by OsRH17, N-427 or C-167, and this suppression was independent of the concentration of the NaCl in the medium. Expression analysis of rRNAs in E. coli revealed that the 16S rRNA precursor accumulated in transgenic E. coli cells, and the relative growth rate was inversely proportional to the levels of pre-16S rRNA accumulation. Results suggested that OsRH17 may play a role in ribosomal biogenesis and suppress 16S rRNA maturation in E. coli. No visible phenotype was observed in transgenic yeast and rice (overexpressing OsRH17, N-427, and C-167, as well as OsRH17 knockdown), and even in some abiotic and biotic stresses, which could be due to the redundancy in rice under normal conditions.
25555239	OsGL1-3 is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis and tolerance to water deficit in rice.	2015	PLoS One	Cuticular wax covers aerial organs of plants and functions as the outermost barrier against non-stomatal water loss. We reported here the functional characterization of the Glossy1(GL1)-homologous gene OsGL1-3 in rice using overexpression and RNAi transgenic rice plants. OsGL1-3 gene was ubiquitously expressed at different level in rice plants except root and its expression was up-regulated under ABA and PEG treatments. The transient expression of OsGL1-3-GFP fusion protein indicated that OsGL1-3 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane. Compared to the wild type, overexpression rice plants exhibited stunted growth, more wax crystallization on leaf surface, and significantly increased total cuticular wax load due to the prominent changes of C30-C32 aldehydes and C30 primary alcohols. While the RNAi knockdown mutant of OsGL1-3 exhibited no significant difference in plant height, but less wax crystallization and decreased total cuticular wax accumulation on leaf surface. All these evidences, together with the effects of OsGL1-3 on the expression of some wax synthesis related genes, suggest that OsGL1-3 is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. Overexpression of OsGL1-3 decreased chlorophyll leaching and water loss rate whereas increased tolerance to water deficit at both seedling and late-tillering stages, suggesting an important role of OsGL1-3 in drought tolerance.
25563494	Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	CCT domain-containing genes generally control flowering in plants. Currently, only six of the 41 CCT family genes have been confirmed to control flowering in rice. To efficiently identify more heading date-related genes from the CCT family, we compared the positions of heading date QTLs and CCT genes and found that 25 CCT family genes were located in the QTL regions. Association mapping showed that a total of 19 CCT family genes were associated with the heading date. Five of the seven associated genes within QTL regions and two of four associated genes outside of the QTL regions were confirmed to regulate heading date by transformation. None of the seven non-associated genes outside of the QTL regions regulates heading date. Obviously, combination of candidate gene-based association mapping with linkage analysis could improve the identification of functional genes. Three novel CCT family genes, including one non-associated (OsCCT01) and two associated genes (OsCCT11 and OsCCT19) regulated the heading date. The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions. Potential functions in regulating heading date of some untested CCT family genes were discussed.
25573482	The effects of phytochrome-mediated light signals on the developmental acquisition of photoperiod sensitivity in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Plants commonly rely on photoperiodism to control flowering time. Rice development before floral initiation is divided into two successive phases: the basic vegetative growth phase (BVP, photoperiod-insensitive phase) and the photoperiod-sensitive phase (PSP). The mechanism responsible for the transition of rice plants into their photoperiod-sensitive state remains elusive. Here, we show that se13, a mutation detected in the extremely early flowering mutant X61 is a nonsense mutant gene of OsHY2, which encodes phytochromobilin (PΦB) synthase, as evidenced by spectrometric and photomorphogenic analyses. We demonstrated that some flowering time and circadian clock genes harbor different expression profiles in BVP as opposed to PSP, and that this phenomenon is chiefly caused by different phytochrome-mediated light signal requirements: in BVP, phytochrome-mediated light signals directly suppress Ehd2, while in PSP, phytochrome-mediated light signals activate Hd1 and Ghd7 expression through the circadian clock genes' expression. These findings indicate that light receptivity through the phytochromes is different between two distinct developmental phases corresponding to the BVP and PSP in the rice flowering process. Our results suggest that these differences might be involved in the acquisition of photoperiod sensitivity in rice.
25582452	Decreased photosynthesis in the erect panicle 3 (ep3) mutant of rice is associated with reduced stomatal conductance and attenuated guard cell development.	2015	J Exp Bot	The ERECT PANICLE 3 gene of rice encodes a peptide that exhibits more than 50% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS). Ectopic expression of the Os02g15950 coding sequence, driven by the HWS (At3g61950) promoter, rescued the hws-1 flower phenotype in Arabidopsis confirming that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. In addition to displaying an erect inflorescence phenotype, loss-of-function mutants of Os02g15950 exhibited a decrease in leaf photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance. Analysis of a range of physiological and anatomical features related to leaf photosynthesis revealed no alteration in Rubisco content and no notable changes in mesophyll size or arrangement. However, both ep3 mutant plants and transgenic lines that have a T-DNA insertion within the Os02g15950 (EP3) gene exhibit smaller stomatal guard cells compared with their wild-type controls. This anatomical characteristic may account for the observed decrease in leaf photosynthesis and provides evidence that EP3 plays a role in regulating stomatal guard cell development.
25604991	Alteration of osa-miR156e expression affects rice plant architecture and strigolactones (SLs) pathway.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Overexpressing osa--miR156e in rice produced a bushy mutant and osa--miR156e regulation of tillering may do this through the strigolactones (SLs) pathway. Appropriate downregulation of osa--miR156 expression contributed to the improvement of plant architecture. Tillering is one of the main determinants for rice architecture and yield. In this study, a bushy mutant of rice was identified with increased tiller number, reduced plant height, prolonged heading date, low seed setting, and small panicle size due to a T-DNA insertion which essentially elevated the expression of osa-miR156e. Transgenic plants with constitutive expression of osa-miR156e also had the bushy phenotype, which showed osa-miR156 may control apical dominance and tiller outgrowth via regulating the strigolactones signaling pathway. Furthermore, the extent of impaired morphology was correlated with the expression level of osa-miR156e. In an attempt to genetically improve rice architecture, ectopic expression of osa-miR156e under the GAL4-UAS system or OsTB1 promoter was conducted. According to agronomic trait analysis, pTB1:osa-miR156e transgenic plants significantly improved the grain yield per plant compared to plants overexpressing osa-miR156e, even though the yield was still inferior to the wild type, making it a very interesting albeit negative result. Our results suggested that osa-miR156 could serve as a potential tool for modifying rice plant architecture through genetic manipulation of the osa-miR156 expression level.
25641188	Characterization and molecular cloning of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (OsSHM1) in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is important for one carbon metabolism and photorespiration in higher plants for its participation in plant growth and development, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. A rice serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene, OsSHM1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis SHM1, was isolated using map-based cloning. The osshm1 mutant had chlorotic lesions and a considerably smaller, lethal phenotype under natural ambient CO2 concentrations, but could be restored to wild type with normal growth under elevated CO2 levels (0.5% CO2 ), showing a typical photorespiratory phenotype. The data from antioxidant enzymes activity measurement suggested that osshm1 was subjected to significant oxidative stress. Also, OsSHM1 was expressed in all organs tested (root, culm, leaf, and young panicle) but predominantly in leaves. OsSHM1 protein is localized to the mitochondria. Our study suggested that molecular function of the OsSHM1 gene is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis.
25634963	Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Asparagine is synthesized from glutamine by the reaction of asparagine synthetase (AS) and is the major nitrogen form in both xylem and phloem sap in rice (Oryza sativa L.). There are two genes encoding AS, OsAS1 and OsAS2, in rice, but the functions of individual AS isoenzymes are largely unknown. Cell type- and NH4(+)-inducible expression of OsAS1 as well as analyses of knockout mutants were carried out in this study to characterize AS1. OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots, with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of the root surface (epidermis, exodermis and sclerenchyma) in an NH4(+)-dependent manner. Conversely, OsAS2 mRNA was abundant in leaf blades and sheathes of rice. Although OsAS2 mRNA was detectable in the roots, its content decreased when NH4(+) was supplied. Retrotransposon-mediated knockout mutants lacking AS1 showed slight stimulation of shoot length and slight reduction in root length at the seedling stage. On the other hand, the mutation caused an approximately 80-90% reduction in free asparagine content in both roots and xylem sap. These results suggest that AS1 is responsible for the synthesis of asparagine in rice roots following the supply of NH4(+). Characteristics of the NH4(+)-dependent increase and the root surface cell-specific expression of OsAS1 gene are very similar to our previous results on cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 and NADH-glutamate synthase1 in rice roots. Thus, AS1 is apparently coupled with the primary assimilation of NH4(+) in rice roots.
25600999	Rice RING E3 ligase may negatively regulate gamma-ray response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: In this study, our findings regarding the regulation of GA irradiation-induced OsGIRP1 in relation to the levels of photosynthesis-related proteins such as OsrbcL1 and OsrbcS1 and hypersensitive responses of overexpressing plants to GR irradiation provide insight into the molecular functions of OsGIRP1 as a negative regulator in response to the stress of radiation. The RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger proteins are known to play crucial roles in various abiotic stresses in plants. Here, we report on RING finger E3 ligase, Oryza sativa gamma rays-induced RING finger protein1 gene (OsGIRP1), which is highly induced by gamma rays (GR) irradiation. In vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution (OsGIRP1(C196A)) of the RING domain showed no E3 ligase activity, supporting the notion that the activity of most E3s is specified by a RING domain. We isolated at least 6 substrate proteins of OsGIRP1, including 2 Rubisco subunits, OsrbcL1 and OsrbcSl, via yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. OsGIRP1 and its partner proteins were targeted to the cytosol and the cytosol or chloroplasts, respectively; however, florescence signals of the complexes with OsGIPR1 were observed in the cytosol. Protein degradation in cell extracts showed that OsGIRP1 mediates proteolysis of 2 substrates, OsrbcS1 and OsrbcL1, via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway. The Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsGIRP1 clearly exhibited increased sensitivity to GR irradiation. These results might suggest that OsGIRP1 acts as a negative regulator of GR response to mediate the degradation of photosynthesis-related proteins.
25617720	Rice OsFLS2-Mediated Perception of Bacterial Flagellins Is Evaded by Xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola.	2015	Mol Plant	Bacterial flagellins are often recognized by the receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE2 (FLS2) and activate MAMP-triggered immunity in dicotyledonous plants. However, the capacity of monocotyledonous rice to recognize flagellins of key rice pathogens and its biological relevance remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that ectopically expressed OsFLS2 in Arabidopsis senses the eliciting flg22 peptide and in vitro purified Acidovorax avenae (Aa) flagellin in an expression level-dependent manner, but does not recognize purified flagellins or derivative flg22(Xo) peptides of Xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae (Xoo) and oryzicola (Xoc). Consistently, the flg22 peptide and purified Aa flagellin, but not Xoo/Xoc flagellins, induce various immune responses such as defense gene induction and MAPK activation in rice. Perception of flagellin by rice does induce strong resistance to Xoo infection, as shown after pre-treatment of rice leaves with Aa flagellin. OsFLS2 was found to differ from AtFLS2 in its perception specificities or sensitivities to different flg22 sequences. In addition, post-translational modification of Xoc flagellin was altered by deletion of glycosyltransferase-encoding rbfC, but this had little effect on Xoc motility and rpfC mutation did not detectably reduce Xoc virulence on rice. Deletion of flagellin-encoding fliC from Xoo/Xoc blocked swimming motility but also did not significantly alter Xoo/Xoc virulence. These results suggest that Xoo/Xoc carry flg22-region amino acid changes that allow motility while evading the ancient flagellin detection system in rice, which retains recognition capacity for other bacterial pathogens.
25625819	CD2-1, the C-Terminal Region of Flagellin, Modulates the Induction of Immune Responses in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Flagellin from the rice avirulent N1141 strain of Acidovorax avenae functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and induces PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in rice. To study the recognition mechanism of flagellin in rice, we attempted to define one or more regions of the flagellin protein required to activate the PTI response. Based on domain classification, we produced four fragments of N1141 flagellin: N-terminal D0, D1. and D2 domains (ND0-2), N-terminal D2, D3, and C-terminal D2 domains (ND2-CD2), C-terminal D2, D1, and D0 domains (CD2-0), and C-terminal D2 and D1 domains (CD2-1). The C-terminal CD2-1 and CD2-0 fragments induced PTI responses in cultured rice cells. Synthetic flg22, which is sufficient to produce the flagellin response in Arabidopsis, and the N-terminal flagellin fragments containing flg22 region elicited very weak immune responses in rice. OsFLS2, the rice ortholog of AtFLS2, which mediates flg22 recognition, was not involved in CD2-0 or CD2-1 recognition in rice. In addition, CD2-0 triggered resistance to coinfection with pathogenic bacteria. Taken together, these data suggest that rice mainly recognizes flagellin CD2-1 by a receptor distinct from OsFLS2 and that this epitope recognition leads to PTI responses.
25682936	A new finely mapped Oryza australiensis-derived QTL in rice confers resistance to brown planthopper.	2015	Gene	Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice in Asia. The BPH resistance in the introgression line IR65482-17-511-5-7 (IR65482-17) is derived from the wild rice species Oryza australiensis. An F2:3 population from a cross between Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and IR65482-17 was used to map three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seedling resistance and feeding rate to BPH. The loci were distributed on chromosomes 2, 4 and 12. The QTL qBph4.2 on chromosome 4 had the largest effect, and contributed 36-44% of the phenotypic variance with a LOD score of 19-29. To validate the effect of qBph4.2, two near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing the qBph4.2 locus in the backgrounds of ZS97 and 9311 were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). BPH bioassays showed that lines homozygous for the IR65482-17 allele (NIL+) of qBph4.2 tented to have significantly higher seedling resistance to BPH than those homozygous for the ZS97 or 9311 alleles (NIL-). Resistance was associated with a lower feeding rate by the insect. qBph4.2 was delimited to a ~300 kb (0.04 cM) region flanked by markers RM261 and S1, and co-segregating with XC4-27. This study will facilitate map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of the gene, and permits further studies of gene function and resistance mechanisms in rice: BPH interaction.
25724637	Activation of symbiosis signaling by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in legumes and rice.	2015	Plant Cell	Establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions involves plant recognition of diffusible signals from the fungus, including lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and chitooligosaccharides (COs). Nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria that associate with leguminous plants also signal to their hosts via LCOs, the so-called Nod factors. Here, we have assessed the induction of symbiotic signaling by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (Myc) fungal-produced LCOs and COs in legumes and rice (Oryza sativa). We show that Myc-LCOs and tetra-acetyl chitotetraose (CO4) activate the common symbiosis signaling pathway, with resultant calcium oscillations in root epidermal cells of Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus. The nature of the calcium oscillations is similar for LCOs produced by rhizobial bacteria and by mycorrhizal fungi; however, Myc-LCOs activate distinct gene expression. Calcium oscillations were activated in rice atrichoblasts by CO4, but not the Myc-LCOs, whereas a mix of CO4 and Myc-LCOs activated calcium oscillations in rice trichoblasts. In contrast, stimulation of lateral root emergence occurred following treatment with Myc-LCOs, but not CO4, in M. truncatula, whereas both Myc-LCOs and CO4 were active in rice. Our work indicates that legumes and non-legumes differ in their perception of Myc-LCO and CO signals, suggesting that different plant species respond to different components in the mix of signals produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
25724641	The rice CK2 kinase regulates trafficking of phosphate transporters in response to phosphate levels.	2015	Plant Cell	Phosphate transporters (PTs) mediate phosphorus uptake and are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. In one key mechanism of posttranslational regulation, phosphorylation of PTs affects their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. However, the kinase(s) mediating PT phosphorylation and the mechanism leading to ER retention of phosphorylated PTs remain unclear. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) kinase subunit, CK2β3, which interacts with PT2 and PT8 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Also, the CK2α3/β3 holoenzyme phosphorylates PT8 under phosphate-sufficient conditions. This phosphorylation inhibited the interaction of PT8 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1, a key cofactor regulating the exit of PTs from the ER to the plasma membrane. Additionally, phosphorus starvation promoted CK2β3 degradation, relieving the negative regulation of PT phosphorus-insufficient conditions. In accordance, transgenic expression of a nonphosphorylatable version of OsPT8 resulted in elevated levels of that protein at the plasma membrane and enhanced phosphorus accumulation and plant growth under various phosphorus regimes. Taken together, these results indicate that CK2α3/β3 negatively regulates PTs and phosphorus status regulates CK2α3/β3.

25688880	Homotypic clustering of OsMYB4 binding site motifs in promoters of the rice genome and cellular-level implications on sheath blight disease resistance.	2015	Gene	The promoter regions (1 kb upstream sequences) of 45,836 annotated genes of rice were analyzed for the presence of OsMYB4 binding sites using a Perl program algorithm. Based on the homotypic clustering concept, 113 promoters were found to have more than 4 binding site motifs. Among the downstream genes of these promoters, five genes which are known to have a role in disease resistance were selected and the binding capacity of OsMYB4 protein in the promoter regions was analyzed by docking studies. Expression level of these genes was analyzed by RT-PCR in Rhizoctonia solani infected rice seedlings. Upon pathogen challenge, higher expression of aminotransferase, ankyrin and WRKY 12 genes was observed corresponding to higher expression of Osmyb4. Over-expression of Osmyb4 cDNA in rice leaf tissues by agro-infection failed to result in similar over-expression of aminotransferase, ankyrin and WRKY 12 as expected. Although the role of OsMYB4 in sheath blight resistance was found to be definitive based on our initial results, artificial over-expression of this TF was observed to be insufficient in regulating the disease resistance related genes.
25675495	FT-like proteins induce transposon silencing in the shoot apex during floral induction in rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Floral induction is a crucial developmental step in higher plants. Florigen, a mobile floral activator that is synthesized in the leaf and transported to the shoot apex, was recently identified as a protein encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its orthologs; the rice florigen is Heading date 3a (Hd3a) protein. The 14-3-3 proteins mediate the interaction of Hd3a with the transcription factor OsFD1 to form a ternary structure called the florigen activation complex on the promoter of OsMADS15, a rice APETALA1 ortholog. However, crucial information, including the spatiotemporal overlap among FT-like proteins and the components of florigen activation complex and downstream genes, remains unclear. Here, we confirm that Hd3a coexists, in the same regions of the rice shoot apex, with the other components of the florigen activation complex and its transcriptional targets. Unexpectedly, however, RNA-sequencing analysis of shoot apex from wild-type and RNA-interference plants depleted of florigen activity revealed that 4,379 transposable elements (TEs; 58% of all classifiable rice TEs) were expressed collectively in the vegetative and reproductive shoot apex. Furthermore, in the reproductive shoot apex, 214 TEs were silenced by florigen. Our results suggest a link between floral induction and regulation of TEs.
25659749	Ectopic phytocystatin expression increases nodule numbers and influences the responses of soybean (Glycine max) to nitrogen deficiency.	2015	Phytochemistry	Cysteine proteases and cystatins have many functions that remain poorly characterised, particularly in crop plants. We therefore investigated the responses of these proteins to nitrogen deficiency in wild-type soybeans and in two independent transgenic soybean lines (OCI-1 and OCI-2) that express the rice cystatin, oryzacystatin-I (OCI). Plants were grown for four weeks under either a high (5 mM) nitrate (HN) regime or in the absence of added nitrate (LN) in the absence or presence of symbiotic rhizobial bacteria. Under the LN regime all lines showed similar classic symptoms of nitrogen deficiency including lower shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll. However, the LN-induced decreases in leaf protein and increases in root protein tended to be smaller in the OCI-1 and OCI-2 lines than in the wild type. When LN-plants were grown with rhizobia, OCI-1 and OCI-2 roots had significantly more crown nodules than wild-type plants. The growth nitrogen regime had a significant effect on the abundance of transcripts encoding vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs), LN-dependent increases in VPE2 and VPE3 transcripts in all lines. However, the LN-dependent increases of VPE2 and VPE3 transcripts were significantly lower in the leaves of OCI-1 and OCI-2 plants than in the wild type. These results show that nitrogen availability regulates the leaf and root cysteine protease, VPE and cystatin transcript profiles in a manner that is in some cases influenced by ectopic OCI expression. Moreover, the OCI-dependent inhibition of papain-like cysteine proteases favours increased nodulation and enhanced tolerance to nitrogen limitation, as shown by the smaller LN-dependent decreases in leaf protein observed in the OCI-1 and OCI-2 plants relative to the wild type.
25599895	Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Potassium (K) deficiency in plants confines root growth and decreases root-to-shoot ratio, thus limiting root K acquisition in culture medium. A WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, has been reported as an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signalling that regulates root cell proliferation. Here, we report that ectopic expression of WOX11 gene driven by the promoter of OsHAK16 encoding a low-K-enhanced K transporter led to an extensive root system and adventitious roots and more effective tiller numbers in rice. The WOX11-regulated root and shoot phenotypes in the OsHAK16p:WOX11 transgenic lines were supported by K-deficiency-enhanced expression of several RR genes encoding type-A cytokinin-responsive regulators, PIN genes encoding auxin transporters and Aux/IAA genes. In comparison with WT, the transgenic lines showed increases in root biomass, root activity and K concentrations in the whole plants, and higher soluble sugar concentrations in roots particularly under low K supply condition. The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots. Expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 in the rice grown in moderate K-deficient soil increased total K uptake by 72% and grain yield by 24%-32%. The results suggest that enlarging root growth and development by the expression of WOX11 in roots could provide a useful option for increasing K acquisition efficiency and cereal crop productivity in low K soil.
25595546	Small subunit of a cold-resistant plant, Timothy, does not significantly alter the catalytic properties of Rubisco in transgenic rice.	2015	Photosynth Res	Effects of overexpression of high activity-type Rubisco small subunit (RbcS) from a cold-resistant plant, timothy (Phleum pratense), on kinetic properties of Rubisco were studied in rice (Oryza sativa). The full-length mRNA sequence of timothy RbcS (PpRbcS1) was determined by 5'RACE and 3'RACE. The coding sequence of PpRbcS1 was fused to the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter and introduced into rice. PpRbcS was highly expressed in leaf blade and accounted for approximately 30 % of total RbcS in homozygous transgenic lines. However, the catalytic turnover rate and K m for CO2 of Rubisco did not significantly change in these transgenic lines compared to non-transgenic rice, suggesting that PpRbcS1 is not effective for improvement of catalytic efficiency of rice Rubisco. The photosynthetic rate and growth were essentially unchanged, whereas the photosynthetic rate at low CO2 condition was marginally increased in transgenic lines. Rubisco content was significantly increased, whereas soluble protein, nitrogen, and chlorophyll contents were unchanged in transgenic lines compared to non-transgenic rice. Because the kinetic properties were similar, observed slight increase in photosynthetic rate at low CO2 is considered to be large due to increase in Rubisco content in transgenic lines. Introduction of foreign RbcS is an effective approach for the improvement of Rubisco kinetics and photosynthesis. However, in this study, it was suggested that RbcS of high activity-type Rubisco, even showing higher amino acid identity with rice RbcS, did not always enhance the catalytic turnover rate of Rubisco in rice. Thus, we should carefully select RbcS to be overexpressed before introduction.
25636203	Gene knockout of glutathione reductase 3 results in increased sensitivity to salt stress in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Glutathione reductase (GR) is one of important antioxidant enzymes in plants. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) with the accompanying oxidation of NADPH. Previously, we showed that salt-stress-responsive GR3 is a functional protein localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria in rice. To learn more about the role of GR3 in salt-stress tolerance, we investigated the response to 100 mM NaCl treatment in wild-type rice (WT); GR3 knockout mutant of rice (gr3); and the functional gr3-complementation line (C1). Rice GR3 was primarily expressed in roots at the seedling stage and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues except the sheath at heading stage. GR3 promoter-GUS was expressed in the vascular cylinder and cortex of root tissues in rice seedlings, vascular tissue of nodes, embryo and aleurone layer of seeds, and young flowers. Under both normal and salt-stress conditions, total GR activity was decreased by 20 % in gr3. Oxidative stress, indicated by malondialdehyde content, was greater in gr3 than the WT under salt stress. As compared with the WT, gr3 was sensitive to salt and methyl viologen; it showed inhibited growth, decreased maximal efficiency of photosystem II, decreased GSH and GSSG contents, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG. Conversely, the gr3-complementation line C1 rescued the tolerance to methyl viologen and salinity and recovered the growth and physiological damage caused by salinity. These results reveal that GR3 plays an important role in salt stress tolerance by regulating the GSH redox state in rice.
25607719	Alterations in Gas Exchange and Oxidative Metabolism in Rice Leaves Infected by Pyricularia oryzae are Attenuated by Silicon.	2015	Phytopathology	Rice blast, caused by Pyricularia oryzae, is the most important disease in rice worldwide. This study investigated the effects of silicon (Si) on the photosynthetic gas exchange parameters (net CO2 assimilation rate [A], stomatal conductance to water vapor [gs], internal-to-ambient CO2 concentration ratio [Ci/Ca], and transpiration rate [E]); chlorophyll fluorescence a (Chla) parameters (maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II [Fv/Fm], photochemical [qP] and nonphotochemical [NPQ] quenching coefficients, and electron transport rate [ETR]); concentrations of pigments, malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and lypoxigenase (LOX) in rice leaves. Rice plants were grown in a nutrient solution containing 0 or 2 mM Si (-Si or +Si, respectively) with and without P. oryzae inoculation. Blast severity decreased with higher foliar Si concentration. The values of A, gs and E were generally higher for the +Si plants in comparison with the -Si plants upon P. oryzae infection. The Fv/Fm, qp, NPQ, and ETR were greater for the +Si plants relative to the -Si plants at 108 and 132 h after inoculation (hai). The values for qp and ETR were significantly higher for the -Si plants in comparison with the +Si plants at 36 hai, and the NPQ was significantly higher for the -Si plants in comparison with the +Si plants at 0 and 36 hai. The concentrations of Chla, Chlb, Chla+b, and carotenoids were significantly greater in the +Si plants relative to the -Si plants. For the -Si plants, the MDA and H2O2 concentrations were significantly higher than those in the +Si plants. The LOX activity was significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. The SOD and GR activities were significantly higher for the -Si plants than in the +Si plants. The CAT and APX activities were significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. The supply of Si contributed to a decrease in blast severity, improved the gas exchange performance, and caused less dysfunction at the photochemical level.
25664791	Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the effector-interaction domain of the resistance protein RGA5-A from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2015	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	RGA5-A, a component of the Pia resistance-protein complex (RGA4/RGA5-A) from Oryza sativa L. japonica, has the ability to interact physically with the effector protein AVR-Pia from Magnaporthe oryzae via its effector-interaction domain RGA5-A_S. The interaction between RGA5-A and AVR-Pia relieves the repression of RGA4, leading to AVR-independent cell death by the freed RGA4. To further understand the details of this interaction, the effector-interaction domain RGA5-A_S was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified recombinant protein His-RGA5-A_S was successfully crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. A single crystal obtained using 0.2 M ammonium citrate, 25%(w/v) PEG 3350 diffracted to 2.43 Å resolution. It belonged to space group P4122 or P4322, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 55.2, c = 78.2 Å, α = β = γ = 90°.
25848690	The OsSec18 complex interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 to regulate vacuolar morphology in rice endosperm cell.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Sec18p/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a conserved eukaryotic ATPase, which primarily functions in vesicle membrane fusion from yeast to human. However, the function of the OsSec18 gene, a homologue of NSF in rice, remains unknown.

RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the function of OsSec18 in rice and found that OsSec18 complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast. Overexpression of OsSec18 in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies. Further examination revealed that OsSec18 presented as a 290-kDa complex in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, Os60sP0 was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the OsSec18 complex contains another complex of P0(P1-P2)2 in rice endosperm cells. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminus of OsSec18 can interact with the N- and C-termini of Os60sP0, whereas the C-terminus of OsSec18 can only interact with the C-terminus of Os60sP0.

CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the OsSec18 regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the OsSec18 interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 complex in rice endosperm cell.
25462965	Constitutive expression and silencing of a novel seed specific calcium dependent protein kinase gene in rice reveals its role in grain filling.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Ca(2+) sensor protein kinases are prevalent in most plant species including rice. They play diverse roles in plant signaling mechanism. Thirty one CDPK genes have been identified in rice and some are functionally characterized. In the present study, the newly identified rice CDPK gene OsCPK31 was functionally validated by overexpression and silencing in Taipei 309 rice cultivar. Spikelets of overexpressing plants showed hard dough stage within 15d after pollination (DAP) with rapid grain filling and early maturation. Scanning electron microscopy of endosperm during starch granule formation confirmed early grain filling. Further, seeds of overexpressing transgenic lines matured early (20-22 DAP) and the average number of maturity days reduced significantly. On the other hand, silencing lines showed more number of unfilled spikelet without any difference in maturity duration. It will be interesting to further decipher the role of OsCPK31 in biological pathways associated with distribution of photosynthetic assimilates during grain filling stage.
25691887	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	SDS is a meiosis specific cyclin-like protein and required for DMC1 mediated double-strand break (DSB) repairing in Arabidopsis. Here, we found its rice homolog, OsSDS, is essential for meiotic DSB formation. The Ossds mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable. The Ossds meiocytes exhibit severe defects in homologous pairing and synapsis. No γH2AX immunosignals in Ossds meiocytes together with the suppression of chromosome fragmentation in Ossds-1 Osrad51c, both provide strong evidences that OsSDS is essential for meiotic DSB formation. Immunostaining investigations revealed that meiotic chromosome axes are normally formed but both SC installation and localization of recombination elements are failed in Ossds. We suspected that this cyclin protein has been differentiated pretty much between monocots and dicots on its function in meiosis.
25765586	The mature anther-preferentially expressed genes are associated with pollen fertility, pollen germination and anther dehiscence in rice.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The anthers and pollen grains are critical for male fertility and hybrid rice breeding. The development of rice mature anther and pollen consists of multiple continuous stages. However, molecular mechanisms regulating mature anther development were poorly understood.

RESULTS: In this study, we have identified 291 mature anther-preferentially expressed genes (OsSTA) in rice based on Affymetrix microarray data. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that OsSTA genes mainly participated in metabolic and cellular processes that are likely important for rice anther and pollen development. The expression patterns of OsSTA genes were validated using real-time PCR and mRNA in situ hybridizations. Cis-element identification showed that most of the OsSTA genes had the cis-elements responsive to phytohormone regulation. Co-expression analysis of OsSTA genes showed that genes annotated with pectinesterase and calcium ion binding activities were rich in the network, suggesting that OsSTA genes could be involved in pollen germination and anther dehiscence. Furthermore, OsSTA RNAi transgenic lines showed male-sterility and pollen germination defects.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that OsSTA genes function in rice male fertility, pollen germination and anther dehiscence and established molecular regulating networks that lay the foundation for further functional studies.
25667045	Knock-down of stress inducible OsSRFP1 encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase with transcriptional activation activity confers abiotic stress tolerance through enhancing antioxidant protection in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in a variety of physiological processes. This study demonstrated the function of a previously unknown rice RING finger E3 ligase, Oryza sativa Stress-related RING Finger Protein 1 (OsSRFP1) in stress responses in rice. OsSRFP1 was ubiquitously expressed in various rice organs, with the higher expression levels in roots, panicles and culm nodes. The transcript of OsSRFP1 was induced by cold, dehydration, salt, H2O2 and abscisic acid treatments. Interestingly, the OsSRFP1-overexpressing plants were less tolerant to salt, cold and oxidative stresses than wild type plants; while the RNA interference silencing of OsSRFP1 plants were more tolerant than wild type without yield penalty. Compared with the wild type, amounts of free proline and activities of antioxidant enzymes were increased in the RNAi plants but decreased in the overexpression plants under cold stress, which were inversely correlated with the malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the tested lines. Microarray analysis showed that expression of numerous genes involving in ROS homeostasis was altered in the OsSRFP1-overexpressing plants under normal and cold conditions. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that OsSRFP1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and the intact RING domain was essential for the activity. Moreover, OsSRFP1 might function in transcriptional regulation with nuclear localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsSRFP1 may have dual functions in post-translational and transcriptional regulations in modulating abiotic stress responses in rice, at least in part, by negatively regulating antioxidant enzymes-mediated reactive oxygen species removal.
25693492	Natural allelic diversity in OsDREB1F gene in the Indian wild rice germplasm led to ascertain its association with drought tolerance.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Three coding SNPs and one haplotype identified in the OsDREB1F gene have potential to be associated with drought tolerance in rice. Drought is a serious constraint to rice production worldwide, that can be addressed by deployment of drought tolerant genes. OsDREB1F, one of the most potent drought tolerance transcription activator genes, was re-sequenced for allele mining and association study in a set of 136 wild rice accessions and four cultivated rice. This analysis led to identify 22 SNPs with eight haplotypes based on allelic variations in the accessions used. The nucleotide variation-based neutrality tests suggested that the OsDREB1F gene has been subjected to purifying selection in the studied set of rice germplasm. Six different OsDREB1F protein variants were identified on the basis of translated amino acid residues amongst the orthologues. Five protein variants were truncated due to deletions in coding region and found susceptible to drought stress. Association study revealed that three coding SNPs of this gene were significantly associated with drought tolerance. One OsDREB1F variant in the activation domain of OsDREB1F gene which led to conversion of aspartate amino acid to glutamate was found to be associated with drought tolerance. Three-dimensional homology modeling assisted to understand the functional significance of this identified potential allele for drought tolerance in rice. The natural allelic variants mined in the OsDREB1F gene can be further used in translational genomics for improving the water use efficiency in rice.
25697101	MONOCULM 3, an ortholog of WUSCHEL in rice, is required for tiller bud formation.	2015	J Genet Genomics	WUSCHEL (WUS) plays an essential role for the maintenance of meristem activity in dicots, but its function is still elusive in monocots. We isolated a new monoculm mutant, monoculm 3 (moc3), in which a point mutation causes the premature termination of rice O. sativa WUS (OsWUS). Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3. MOC3 was localized in the nuclear and could interact with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs). The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs. Our results suggest that MOC3 is required for the formation of axillary buds and has a complex relationship with cytokinins.
25687295	Operative photo assimilation associated proteome modulations are critical for iron-dependent cadmium tolerance in Oryza sativa L.	2015	Protoplasma	Iron-dependent Cd tolerance in Oryza sativa L. cv 7029 had been explored. Photo assimilatory process such as photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation found to be functional in the presence of excess Fe during Cd stress. Cd-inducible Fe deficiency demonstrated with upregulation of iron uptake gene families such as OsIRT and OsYSL was attributed as foremost reason for retardation of photo assimilation in the course of Cd treatment. Upholding of photo assimilation during Fe supplement was associated with proteome modulations. Monitoring of proteome responses in leaf and root revealed proteins imperative for alleviation of Cd stress. Specifically, proteins that take part in photosynthesis, glucose metabolism, nitrogen fixation, and abiotic stress tolerance played key role in Fe-dependent Cd detoxification. It is concluded that Fe supply help to operate photo assimilation which enable favorable proteome responses of Cd stress tolerance.
25675970	DEFORMED FLORAL ORGAN1 (DFO1) regulates floral organ identity by epigenetically repressing the expression of OsMADS58 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	New Phytol	Floral organ identity in plants is controlled by floral homeotic A/B/C/D/E-class genes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, several epigenetic repressors that regulate these floral organ identity genes have been characterized. However, the roles of epigenetic factors in rice floral development have not been explored in detail. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a rice epigenetic repressor, DEFORMED FLORAL ORGAN1 (DFO1) gene, which causes abnormal floral morphology when mutated. We isolated dfo1 by mapping, and confirmed its function by rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analysis. We showed that DFO1 is constitutively expressed and encodes a nuclear-localized protein. Mutation of DFO1 causes the ectopic expression of C-class genes in the dfo1-1 mutant, and overexpression of OsMADS58, a C-class gene, phenocopies the dfo1 mutants. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that DFO1 interacts with the rice polycomb group (PcG) proteins (OsMSI1 and OsiEZ1). Remarkably, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27, a mark of epigenetic repression, is significantly reduced on OsMADS58 chromatin in the dfo1-1 mutant. Our results suggest that DFO1 functions in maintaining rice floral organ identity by cooperating with PcG proteins to regulate the H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic repression on OsMADS58.
25676661	The role of thionins in rice defence against root pathogens.	2015	Mol Plant Pathol	Thionins are antimicrobial peptides that are involved in plant defence. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the role of rice thionin genes in defence responses against two root pathogens: the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola and the oomycete Pythium graminicola. The expression of rice thionin genes was observed to be differentially regulated by defence-related hormones, whereas all analysed genes were consistently down-regulated in M. graminicola-induced galls, at least until 7 days post-inoculation (dpi). Transgenic lines of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare overproducing OsTHI7 revealed decreased susceptibility to M. graminicola infection and P. graminicola colonization. Taken together, these results demonstrate the role of rice thionin genes in defence against two of the most damaging root pathogens attacking rice.
25702710	Involvement of OsPht1;4 in phosphate acquisition and mobilization facilitates embryo development in rice.	2015	Plant J	Phosphate (Pi) transporters mediate acquisition and transportation of Pi within plants. Here, we investigated the functions of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4), one of the 13 members of the Pht1 family in rice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed strong expression of OsPT4 in roots and embryos, and OsPT4 promoter analysis using reporter genes confirmed these findings. Analysis using rice protoplasts showed that OsPT4 localized to the plasma membrane. OsPT4 complemented a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake, and also facilitated increased accumulation of Pi in Xenopus oocytes. Further, OsPT4 genetically modified (GM) rice lines were generated by knockout/knockdown or over-expression of OsPT4. Pi concentrations in roots and shoots were significantly lower and higher in knockout/knockdown and over-expressing plants, respectively, compared to wild-type under various Pi regimes. (33) Pi uptake translocation assays corroborated the altered acquisition and mobilization of Pi in OsPT4 GM plants. We also observed effects of altered expression levels of OsPT4 in GM plants on the concentration of Pi, the size of the embryo, and several attributes related to seed development. Overall, our results suggest that OsPT4 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Pi transporter that facilitates acquisition and mobilization of Pi, and also plays an important role in development of the embryo in rice.
25804812	Ectopic expression of EbFIE from apomictic Eulaliopsis binata in rice results in pleiotropic phenotypes likely due to interaction with OsCLF.	2015	Plant Sci	FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) is a core component of PcG complexes and functions in plant phase transition and seed generation. However, understanding in its function of apomictic monocot plants remains blank. Here an FIE homology EbFIE, has been isolated from apomictic Graminae species Eulaliopsis binata. EbFIE shares higher homology to OsFIE2 than OsFIE1, and has been classified into the monocot FIE2 clade. In addition, the broad expression pattern of EbFIE is also similar to OsFIE2. While, ectopic expression of EbFIE in rice resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes similar to that of OsFIE1 over-expressing plants. Meanwhile, EbFIE could bind OsCLF in vitro as OsFIE1 but different with OsFIE2. Molecular models comparison indicated that both EbFIE and OsFIE1 had a smaller E(z) protein binding groove than OsFIE2. Further site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that single amino acid substitution of I194F in OsFIE2 could improve its OsCLF binding capacity. Taken together, our results suggested that EbFIE was a conserved FIE homolog belonging to monocot FIE2 clade, but due to the similarity in protein conformation with FIE1, EbFIE might play a broad role in vegetative and reproductive development regulation by interaction with CLF homolog.
25677853	The alteration in the architecture of a T-DNA insertion rice mutant osmtd1 is caused by up-regulation of MicroRNA156f.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Plant architecture is an important factor for crop production. Some members of microRNA156 (miR156) and their target genes SQUAMOSA Promoter-Binding Protein-Like (SPL) were identified to play essential roles in the establishment of plant architecture. However, the roles and regulation of miR156 is not well understood yet. Here, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant Osmtd1 (Oryza sativa multi-tillering and dwarf mutant). Osmtd1 produced more tillers and displayed short stature phenotype. We determined that the dramatic morphological changes were caused by a single T-DNA insertion in Osmtd1. Further analysis revealed that the T-DNA insertion was located in the gene Os08g34258 encoding a putative inhibitor I family protein. Os08g34258 was knocked out and OsmiR156f was significantly upregulated in Osmtd1. Overexpression of Os08g34258 in Osmtd1 complemented the defects of the mutant architecture, while overexpression of OsmiR156f in wild-type rice phenocopied Osmtd1. We showed that the expression of OsSPL3, OsSPL12, and OsSPL14 were significantly downregulated in Osmtd1 or OsmiR156f overexpressed lines, indicating that OsSPL3, OsSPL12, and OsSPL14 were possibly direct target genes of OsmiR156f. Our results suggested that OsmiR156f controlled plant architecture by mediating plant stature and tiller outgrowth and may be regulated by an unknown protease inhibitor I family protein.
25647508	A key ABA catabolic gene, OsABA8ox3, is involved in drought stress resistance in rice.	2015	PLoS One	Expressions of ABA biosynthesis genes and catabolism genes are generally co-regulated in plant development and responses to environmental stress. Up-regulation of OsNCED3 gene, a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, has been suggested as a way to enhance plant drought resistance but little is known for the role of ABA catabolic genes during drought stress. In this study, we found that OsABA8ox3 was the most highly expressed gene of the OsABA8ox family in rice leaves. Expression of OsABA8ox3 was promptly induced by rehydration after PEG-mimic dehydration, a tendency opposite to the changes of ABA level. We therefore constructed rice OsABA8ox3 silencing (RNA interference, RNAi) and overexpression plants. There were no obvious phenotype differences between the transgenic seedlings and wild type under normal condition. However, OsABA8ox3 RNAi lines showed significant improvement in drought stress tolerance while the overexpression seedlings were hypersensitive to drought stress when compared with wild type in terms of plant survival rates after 10 days of unwatering. Enzyme activity analysis indicated that OsABA8ox3 RNAi plants had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and less malondialdehyde (MDA) content than those of wild type when the plants were exposed to dehydration treatment, indicating a better anti-oxidative stress capability and less membrane damage. DNA microarray and real-time PCR analysis under dehydration treatment revealed that expressions of a group of stress/drought-related genes, i.e. LEA genes, were enhanced with higher transcript levels in OsABA8ox3 RNAi transgenic seedlings. We therefore conclude that that OsABA8ox3 gene plays an important role in controlling ABA level and drought stress resistance in rice.
25717038	Establishment of monitoring methods for autophagy in rice reveals autophagic recycling of chloroplasts and root plastids during energy limitation.	2015	Plant Physiol	Autophagy is an intracellular process leading to vacuolar or lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components in eukaryotes. Establishment of proper methods to monitor autophagy was a key step in uncovering its role in organisms, such as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mammals, and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), in which chloroplastic proteins were found to be recycled by autophagy. Chloroplast recycling has been predicted to function in nutrient remobilization for growing organs or grain filling in cereal crops. Here, to develop our understanding of autophagy in cereals, we established monitoring methods for chloroplast autophagy in rice (Oryza sativa). We generated transgenic rice-expressing fluorescent protein (FP) OsAuTophaGy8 (OsATG8) fusions as autophagy markers. FP-ATG8 signals were delivered into the vacuolar lumen in living cells of roots and leaves mainly as vesicles corresponding to autophagic bodies. This phenomenon was not observed upon the addition of wortmannin, an inhibitor of autophagy, or in an ATG7 knockout mutant. Markers for the chloroplast stroma, stromal FP, and FP-labeled Rubisco were delivered by a type of autophagic body called the Rubisco-containing body (RCB) in the same manner. RCB production in excised leaves was suppressed by supply of external sucrose or light. The release of free FP caused by autophagy-dependent breakdown of FP-labeled Rubisco was induced during accelerated senescence in individually darkened leaves. In roots, nongreen plastids underwent both RCB-mediated and entire organelle types of autophagy. Therefore, our newly developed methods to monitor autophagy directly showed autophagic degradation of leaf chloroplasts and root plastids in rice plants and its induction during energy limitation.
25711711	Differential expression of GS5 regulates grain size in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Grain weight is a major determinant of grain yield. GS5 is a positive regulator of grain size such that grain width, filling, and weight are correlated with its expression level. Previous work suggested that polymorphisms of GS5 in the promoter region might be responsible for the variation in grain size. In this study, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the wide-grain allele GS5-1 and the narrow-grain allele GS5-2 in the upstream region of the gene that were responsible for the differential expression in developing young panicles were identified. These two polymorphs altered the responses of the GS5 alleles to abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, resulting in higher expression of GS5-1 than of GS5-2 in developing young panicles. It was also shown that SNPs in light-responsive elements of the promoter altered the response to light induction, leading to higher expression of GS5-2 than GS5-1 in leaves. Enhanced expression of GS5 competitively inhibits the interaction between OsBAK1-7 and OsMSBP1 by occupying the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of OsBAK1-7, thus preventing OsBAK1-7 from endocytosis caused by interacting with OsMSBP1, providing an explanation for the positive association between grain size and GS5 expression. These results advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which GS5 controls grain size.
25757473	Punctual transcriptional regulation by the rice circadian clock under fluctuating field conditions.	2015	Plant Cell	Plant circadian clocks that oscillate autonomously with a roughly 24-h period are entrained by fluctuating light and temperature and globally regulate downstream genes in the field. However, it remains unknown how punctual internal time produced by the circadian clock in the field is and how it is affected by environmental fluctuations due to weather or daylength. Using hundreds of samples of field-grown rice (Oryza sativa) leaves, we developed a statistical model for the expression of circadian clock-related genes integrating diurnally entrained circadian clock with phase setting by light, both responses to light and temperature gated by the circadian clock. We show that expression of individual genes was strongly affected by temperature. However, internal time estimated from expression of multiple genes, which may reflect transcriptional regulation of downstream genes, is punctual to 22 min and not affected by weather, daylength, or plant developmental age in the field. We also revealed perturbed progression of internal time under controlled environment or in a mutant of the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA. Thus, we demonstrated that the circadian clock is a regulatory network of multiple genes that retains accurate physical time of day by integrating the perturbations on individual genes under fluctuating environments in the field.
25791495	The Arabidopsis Ca²⁺-dependent protein kinase CPK27 is required for plant response to salt-stress.	2015	Gene	Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play vital roles in plant adaptations to environmental challenges. The precise regulatory mechanism of CDPKs in mediating salt stress still remains unclear, although several CDPK members have been identified to be involved in salt stress accumulation in various plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Here, we investigated the function of an Arabidopsis CDPK, CPK27, in salt stress-signaling. CPK27 is a membrane-localized protein kinase; its expression was induced by NaCl. cpk27-1, a T-DNA insertion mutant of CPK27, was much more sensitive to salt stress than wild-type plants in terms of seed germination and post-germination seedling growth. In ion-flux assay, cpk27-1 mutants exhibited a lower capacity than wild-type plants to extrude Na(+) and import H(+) after a long-term salt treatment (110mM NaCl for 10days). Moreover, the content of Na(+) was higher and K(+) was lower in cpk27-1 mutants than in wild-type plants under salt stress. In addition, the level of salt-elicited H2O2 production was higher in cpk27-1 mutants than in wild-type plants Col after a short-term NaCl shock and long-term salt treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that CPK27 is required for plant adaptation to salt stress.
25733849	Boosting CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex editing capability with the endogenous tRNA-processing system.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system is being harnessed as a powerful tool for genome engineering in basic research, molecular therapy, and crop improvement. This system uses a small guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site; thus, its targeting capability is largely constrained by the gRNA-expressing device. In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5' targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100%). Because tRNA and its processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms, this method could be broadly used to boost the targeting capability and editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 toolkits.
25769309	qRT9, a quantitative trait locus controlling root thickness and root length in upland rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Breeding for strong root systems is an important strategy for improving drought avoidance in rice. To clone genes responsible for strong root traits, an upland rice introgression line IL392 with thicker and longer roots than the background parent lowland rice Yuefu was selected. A quantitative trait locus (QTL), qRT9, controlling root thickness and root length was detected under hydroponic culture using 203 F(2:3) populations derived from a cross between Yuefu and IL392. The qRT9 locus explained 32.5% and 28.1% of the variance for root thickness and root length, respectively. Using 3185 F2 plants, qRT9 was ultimately narrowed down to an 11.5 kb region by substitution mapping. One putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, LOC_Os09g28210 (named OsbHLH120), is annotated in this region. Sequences of OsbHLH120 in 11 upland rice and 13 lowland rice indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 82 and an insertion/deletion (Indel) at position 628-642 cause amino acid changes and are conserved between upland rice and lowland rice. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the two polymorphisms were significantly associated with root thickness and root length under hydroponic culture. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsbHLH120 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), salt, and abscisic acid, but higher expression was present in IL392 roots than in Yuefu under PEG and salt stress. The successfully isolated locus, qRT9, enriches our knowledge of the genetic basis for drought avoidance and provides an opportunity for breeding drought avoidance varieties by utilizing valuable genes in the upland rice germplasm.
25743039	Expression of developmentally regulated plasma membrane polypeptide (DREPP2) in rice root tip and interaction with Ca(2+)/CaM complex and microtubule.	2015	Protoplasma	The cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) could play an important role for salt tolerance in rice root (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we compared the expression profiles of two putative developmentally regulated plasma membrane polypeptides (DREPP1 and DREPP2) in rice roots of salt-tolerant cv. Pokkali and salt-sensitive cv. IR29. The messenger RNA (mRNA) for OsDREPP1 could be detected in all parts of root and did not change upon salt stress, whereas the mRNA for OsDREPP2 was detected only in root tips. The transcript level of OsDREPP2 first disappeared upon salt stress, then recovered in Pokkali, but not recovered in IR29. The gene-encoding OsDREPP2 was cloned from cv. Pokkali and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its biochemical properties were studied. It was found that OsDREPP2 is a Ca(2+)-binding protein and binds also to calmodulin (CaM) as well as microtubules. The mutation of Trp4 and Phe16 in OsDREPP2 to Ala decreased the binding of DREPP2 to Ca(2+)/CaM complex, indicating the N-terminal basic domain is involved for the binding. The binding of OsDREPP2 to microtubules was inhibited by Ca(2+)/CaM complex, while the binding of double-mutant OsDREPP2 protein to microtubules was not inhibited by Ca(2+)/CaM complex. We propose that CaM inhibits the binding of DREPP2 to cortical microtubules, causes the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization, and enhances the cell elongation.
25809382	Highly specific gene silencing in a monocot species by artificial microRNAs derived from chimeric miRNA precursors.	2015	Plant J	Artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) are used for selective gene silencing in plants. However, current methods to produce amiRNA constructs for silencing transcripts in monocot species are not suitable for simple, cost-effective and large-scale synthesis. Here, a series of expression vectors based on Oryza sativa MIR390 (OsMIR390) precursor was developed for high-throughput cloning and high expression of amiRNAs in monocots. Four different amiRNA sequences designed to target specifically endogenous genes and expressed from OsMIR390-based vectors were validated in transgenic Brachypodium distachyon plants. Surprisingly, amiRNAs accumulated to higher levels and were processed more accurately when expressed from chimeric OsMIR390-based precursors that include distal stem-loop sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana MIR390a (AtMIR390a). In all cases, transgenic plants displayed the predicted phenotypes induced by target gene repression, and accumulated high levels of amiRNAs and low levels of the corresponding target transcripts. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling combined with 5'-RLM-RACE analysis in transgenic plants confirmed that amiRNAs were highly specific.
25617318	OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	The basic functions of plant-specific TIFY proteins as transcriptional regulators have been reported in plants. Some TIFY genes are responsive to abiotic stresses, but the functions of these genes in stress tolerance have seldom been reported. OsJAZ9 is a member of the JAZ subfamily which belongs to the TIFY gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Suppression of OsJAZ9 resulted in reduced salt tolerance. The altered salt tolerance was mainly due to changes in ion (especially K(+)) homeostasis, which was supported by the altered expression levels of several ion transporter genes. The OsJAZ9-suppression rice plants showed increased sensitivity to jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling. OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain. OsbHLH062 can bind to an E-box in the promoters of the ion transporter genes such as OsHAK21, and most of these ion transporter genes are responsive to JA treatment. We found that OsJAZ9 can also interact with OsNINJA, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional repressor NINJA in JA signaling. Both OsJAZ9 and OsNINJA (Novel Interactor of JAZ) repressed OsbHLH062-mediated transcription activation. These results together suggest that OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator by forming a transcriptional regulation complex with OsNINJA and OsbHLH to fine tune the expression of JA-responsive genes involved in salt stress tolerance in rice.
25852730	MicroRNA399 is involved in multiple nutrient starvation responses in rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The increasing evidences have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant role in nutrient stress response. Previously, miR399 was documented to be induced by phosphorus (P) starvation and involved in regulating P starvation responses. To further investigate the function of miR399 in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we performed GeneChip analysis with OsmiR399 over-expressing plants. Interestingly, our results showed that, besides P starvation responsive genes, the expression of a number of genes involved in iron (Fe), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and calcium (Ca) absorption was dramatically up-regulated in OsmiR399 over-expressing plants. Consistently, the concentrations of Fe, K, Na, and Ca were also increased in OsmiR399 over-expressing plants. The expression of OsmiR399 was also up-regulated by these nutrient starvations, respectively. Moreover, the loss-of-function of LTN1, the down-stream target of OsmiR399, also resulted in the increase of multiple metal elements and the up-regulation of the absorption related genes. These results indicated that OsmiR399 participates in the regulation of multiple nutrient starvation responses, which also gives new view on understanding the interaction among different nutrients mediated by miR399.
25867332	Screening of rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsPR1b-interacting factors and their roles in resisting bacterial blight.	2015	Genet Mol Res	PR genes, a type of genetic marker, are constitutively expressed at background levels, while being easily inducible by pathogenic bacteria. By using a yeast two-hybrid technique, four rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsPR1b-interacting factors were screened. Homozygous plants overexpressing OsPR1b were prepared by transgenic technology. We postulated that OsPR1b may participate in the resistance signaling pathway of rice. Of simultaneous treatments with hormones and pathogenic bacteria, exogenously applying JA and ET significantly increased the expression level of OsPR1b genes in seedlings. Compared with the control group that was inoculated with water, inoculation with a mixture of water and pathogenic bacteria hardly affected the expression level of OsPR1b gene, while cotreatment with SA and pathogenic bacteria slightly upregulated the expression level. However, cotreatment with JA or ET and pathogenic bacteria managed to significantly upregulate the expression level of the OsPR1b gene by 4.8 or 5.7 fold. PR genes, which are sensitive, are prone to many unknown factors during expression, and the detailed regulatory mechanisms in rice still require in-depth studies.
25738428	Rice immune regulator, OsPti1a, is specifically phosphorylated at the plasma membrane.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	OsPti1a (Pto-interacting protein 1a) has important roles in the regulation of immune responses in rice. Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in OsPti1a is necessary to activate defense responses; however, the regulatory mechanism of OsPti1a-mediated immune responses is still obscure. Recently, we revealed that OsPti1a forms protein complex(es) at the plasma membrane and this localization is required for its function. Here, we show that membrane-localized OsPti1a was selectively phosphorylated. Additionally, phosphorylation was not required for the localization of OsPti1a at the membrane. These results suggest that OsPti1a protein is selectively regulated by its phosphorylation after OsPti1a localizes to the plasma membrane.
25788736	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	2015	J Exp Bot	Axillary meristems (AMs) are secondary shoot meristems whose outgrowth determines plant architecture. In rice, AMs form tillers, and tillering mutants reveal an interplay between transcription factors and the phytohormones auxin and strigolactone as some factors that underpin this developmental process. Previous studies showed that knockdown of the transcription factor gene RFL reduced tillering and caused a very large decrease in panicle branching. Here, the relationship between RFL, AM initiation, and outgrowth was examined. We show that RFL promotes AM specification through its effects on LAX1 and CUC genes, as their expression was modulated on RFL knockdown, on induction of RFL:GR fusion protein, and by a repressive RFL-EAR fusion protein. Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants. Additionally, subtle change in the spatial pattern of IR4 DR5:GFP auxin reporter was observed, which hints at compromised auxin transport on RFL knockdown. The relationship between RFL, strigolactone signalling, and bud outgrowth was studied by transcript analyses and by the tillering phenotype of transgenic plants knocked down for both RFL and D3. These data suggest indirect RFL-strigolactone links that may affect tillering. Further, we show expression modulation of the auxin transporter gene OsPIN3 upon RFL:GR protein induction and by the repressive RFL-EAR protein. These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1. Together, we have found that RFL regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport.
25800365	A cytochrome P450, OsDSS1, is involved in growth and drought stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Cytochrome P450s are among the largest protein coding gene families in plant genomes. However, majority of the genes remain uncharacterized. Here, we report the characterization of dss1, a rice mutant showing dwarfism and reduced grain size. The dss1 phenotype is caused by a non-synonymous point mutation we identified in DSS1, which is member of a P450 gene cluster located on rice chromosome 3 and corresponds to the previously reported CYP96B4/SD37 gene. Phenotypes of several dwarf mutants characterized in rice are associated with defects in the biosynthesis or perception of the phytohormones gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs). However, both GA and BR failed to rescue the dss1 phenotype. Hormone profiling revealed the accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and ABA metabolites, as well as significant reductions in GA19 and GA53 levels, precursors of the bioactive GA1, in the mutant. The dss1 contents of cytokinin and auxins were not significantly different from wild-type plants. Consistent with the accumulation of ABA and metabolites, germination and early growth was delayed in dss1, which also exhibited an enhanced tolerance to drought. Additionally, expressions of members of the DSS1/CYP96B gene cluster were regulated by drought stress and exogenous ABA. RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling revealed, among others, that cell wall-related genes and genes involved in lipid metabolism were up- and down-regulated in dss1, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that DSS1 mediates growth and stress responses in rice by fine-tuning GA-to-ABA balance, and might as well play a role in lipid metabolism.
25735958	Reduced ABA Accumulation in the Root System is Caused by ABA Exudation in Upland Rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Gaoshan1) and this Enhanced Drought Adaptation.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Lowland rice (Nipponbare) and upland rice (Gaoshan 1) that are comparable under normal and moderate drought conditions showed dramatic differences in severe drought conditions, both naturally occurring long-term drought and simulated rapid water deficits. We focused on their root response and found that enhanced tolerance of upland rice to severe drought conditions was mainly due to the lower level of ABA in its roots than in those of the lowland rice. We first excluded the effect of ABA biosynthesis and catabolism on root-accumulated ABA levels in both types of rice by monitoring the expression of four OsNCED genes and two OsABA8ox genes. Next, we excluded the impact of the aerial parts on roots by suppressing leaf-biosynthesized ABA with fluridone and NDGA (nordihydroguaiaretic acid), and measuring the ABA level in detached roots. Instead, we proved that upland rice had the ability to export considerably more root-sourced ABA than lowland rice under severe drought, which improved ABA-dependent drought adaptation. The investigation of apoplastic pH in root cells and root anatomy showed that ABA leakage in the root system of upland rice was related to high apoplastic pH and the absence of Casparian bands in the sclerenchyma layer. Finally, taking some genes as examples, we predicted that different ABA levels in rice roots stimulated distinct ABA perception and signaling cascades, which influenced its response to water stress.
25750424	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	2015	J Exp Bot	Membrane proteins are synthesized and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and continue their path to their site of residence along the secretory pathway. The COPII system has been identified as a key player for selecting and directing the fate of membrane and secretory cargo proteins. Selection of cargo proteins within the COPII vesicles is achieved by cargo receptors. The cornichon cargo receptor belongs to a conserved protein family found in eukaryotes that has been demonstrated to participate in the selection of integral membrane proteins as cargo for their correct targeting. Here it is demonstrated at the cellular level that rice cornichon OsCNIH1 interacts with OsHKT1;3 and, in yeast cells, enables the expression of the sodium transporter to the Golgi apparatus. Physical and functional HKT-cornichon interactions are confirmed by the mating-based split ubiquitin system, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and Xenopus oocyte and yeast expression systems. The interaction between the two proteins occurs in the ER of plant cells and their co-expression in oocytes leads to the sequestration of the transporter in the ER. In the yeast cornichon mutant erv14, OsHKT1;3 is mistargeted, preventing the toxic effects of sodium transport in the cell observed in wild-type cells or in the erv14 mutant that co-expressed OsHKT1;3 with either OsCNIH1 or Erv14p. Identification and characterization of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor opens up the opportunity to improve our knowledge on membrane protein targeting in plant cells.
25807209	Rice ubiquitin ligase EL5 prevents root meristematic cell death under high nitrogen conditions and interacts with a cytosolic GAPDH.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Root formation in rice transformants overexpressing mutated EL5 (mEL5) was severely inhibited because of meristematic cell death. Cell death was caused by nitrogen sources, particularly nitrate forms, in the culture medium. Nitrite treatment increased the cytokinin contents in roots, but mEL5 contained more cytokinins than non-transformants. Transcriptome profiling showed overlaps between nitrite-responsive genes in non-transformants and genes with altered expression in untreated mEL5. These results indicate that impairment of EL5 function activates nitrogen signaling despite the absence of a nitrogen source. Physical interaction between the EL5 C-terminal region and a cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, OsGapC2, was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Elucidation of the role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in oxidative cell death in plants is expected in future.
25807460	OsKinesin-13A is an active microtubule depolymerase involved in glume length regulation via affecting cell elongation.	2015	Sci Rep	Grain size is an important trait influencing both the yield and quality of rice and its major determinant is glume size. However, how glume size is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we report the characterization of OsKinesin-13A, which regulates cell elongation and glume length in rice. The mutant of OsKinesin-13A, sar1, displayed length reduction in grains and other organs including internodes, leaves and roots. The grain phenotype in sar1 was directly caused by reduction in glume length, which in turn restricted caryopsis size. Histological results revealed that length decrease in sar1 organs resulted from abnormalities in cell elongation. The orientation of cellulose microfibrils was defective in sar1. Consistently, sar1 showed reduced transverse orientation of cortical microtubules. Further observations demonstrated that microtubule turnover was decreased in sar1. OsKinesin-13A was shown to be an active microtubule depolymerase and mainly distributed on vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus and destined for the cell surface. Thus, our results suggest that OsKinesin-13A utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation.
25786829	Autophagy supports biomass production and nitrogen use efficiency at the vegetative stage in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Much of the nitrogen in leaves is distributed to chloroplasts, mainly in photosynthetic proteins. During leaf senescence, chloroplastic proteins, including Rubisco, are rapidly degraded, and the released nitrogen is remobilized and reused in newly developing tissues. Autophagy facilitates the degradation of intracellular components for nutrient recycling in all eukaryotes, and recent studies have revealed critical roles for autophagy in Rubisco degradation and nitrogen remobilization into seeds in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we examined the function of autophagy in vegetative growth and nitrogen usage in a cereal plant, rice (Oryza sativa). An autophagy-disrupted rice mutant, Osatg7-1, showed reduced biomass production and nitrogen use efficiency compared with the wild type. While Osatg7-1 showed early visible leaf senescence, the nitrogen concentration remained high in the senescent leaves. (15)N pulse chase analysis revealed suppression of nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence in Osatg7-1. Accordingly, the reduction of nitrogen available for newly developing tissues in Osatg7-1 likely led its reduced leaf area and tillers. The limited leaf growth in Osatg7-1 decreased the photosynthetic capacity of the plant. Much of the nitrogen remaining in senescent leaves of Osatg7-1 was in soluble proteins, and the Rubisco concentration in senescing leaves of Osatg7-1 was about 2.5 times higher than in the wild type. Transmission electron micrographs showed a cytosolic fraction rich with organelles in senescent leaves of Osatg7-1. Our results suggest that autophagy contributes to efficient nitrogen remobilization at the whole-plant level by facilitating protein degradation for nitrogen recycling in senescent leaves.
25772680	Stress-induced Oryza sativa BAT1 dual helicase exhibits unique bipolar translocation.	2015	Protoplasma	HLA-B associated transcript 1 (BAT1) protein, also named as spliceosome RNA helicase UAP56, is a member of the DExD/H-box family of helicases. However, regulation under stress, biochemical properties, and functions of plant homologue of BAT1 are poorly understood. Here, we report the purification and detailed biochemical characterization of the Oryza sativa homologue of BAT1 (OsBAT1/UAP56) protein (52 kDa) and regulation of its transcript under abiotic stress. OsBAT1 transcript levels are enhanced in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress including salt stress and abscisic acid. Purified OsBAT1 protein exhibits the DNA- and RNA-dependent ATPase, RNA helicase, and DNA- and RNA-binding activities. Interestingly OsBAT1 also exhibits unique DNA helicase activity, which has not been reported so far in any BAT1 homologue. Moreover, OsBAT1 translocates in both the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions, which is also a unique property. The K m value for OsBAT1 DNA helicase is 0.9753 nM and for RNA helicase is 1.7536 nM, respectively. This study demonstrates several unique characteristics of OsBAT1 especially its ability to unwind both DNA and RNA duplexes; bipolar translocation and its transcript upregulation under abiotic stresses indicate that it is a multifunctional protein. Overall, this study represents significant contribution in advancing our knowledge regarding functions of OsBAT1 in RNA and DNA metabolism and its putative role in abiotic stress signaling in plants.
25760462	Expression pattern and subcellular localization of the ovate protein family in rice.	2015	PLoS One	The Arabidopsis ovate family proteins (AtOFPs) have been shown to function as transcriptional repressors and regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development. There are 31 genes that encode the full-length OVATE-domain containing proteins in the rice genome. In this study, the gene structure analysis revealed that OsOFPs are intron poor. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OVATE proteins from rice, Arabidopsis and tomato can be divided into 4 groups (I-IV). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis identified OsOFPs with different tissue-specific expression patterns at all stages of development in the rice plant. Interestingly, nearly half of the total number of OsOFP family was more highly expressed during the seed developmental stage. In addition, seed developmental cis-elements were found in the promoter region of the OsOFPs. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that YFP-OsOFP fusion proteins predominantly localized in the nucleus. Our results suggest that OsOFPs may act as regulatory proteins and play pivotal roles in the growth and development of rice.
25824047	The rice ent-KAURENE SYNTHASE LIKE 2 encodes a functional ent-beyerene synthase.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The rice genome contains a family of kaurene synthase-like (OsKSL) genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of various diterpenoids, including gibberellins and phytoalexins. While many OsKSL genes have been functionally characterized, the functionality of OsKSL2 is still unclear and it has been proposed to be a pseudogene. Here, we found that OsKSL2 is drastically induced in roots by methyl jasmonate treatment and we successfully isolated a full-length cDNA for OsKSL2. Sequence analysis of the OsKSL2 cDNA revealed that the open reading frame of OsKSL2 is mispredicted in the two major rice genome databases, IRGSP-RAP and MSU-RGAP. In vitro conversion assay indicated that recombinant OsKSL2 catalyzes the cyclization of ent-CDP into ent-beyerene as a major and ent-kaurene as a minor product. ent-Beyerene is an antimicrobial compound and OsKSL2 is induced by methyl jasmonate; these data suggest that OsKSL2 is a functional ent-beyerene synthase that is involved in defense mechanisms in rice roots.
25841037	Ethylene responses in rice roots and coleoptiles are differentially regulated by a carotenoid isomerase-mediated abscisic acid pathway.	2015	Plant Cell	Ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) act synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant growth and development. ABA is derived from the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Here, we analyzed the interplay among ethylene, carotenoid biogenesis, and ABA in rice (Oryza sativa) using the rice ethylene response mutant mhz5, which displays a reduced ethylene response in roots but an enhanced ethylene response in coleoptiles. We found that MHZ5 encodes a carotenoid isomerase and that the mutation in mhz5 blocks carotenoid biosynthesis, reduces ABA accumulation, and promotes ethylene production in etiolated seedlings. ABA can largely rescue the ethylene response of the mhz5 mutant. Ethylene induces MHZ5 expression, the production of neoxanthin, an ABA biosynthesis precursor, and ABA accumulation in roots. MHZ5 overexpression results in enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots and reduced ethylene sensitivity in coleoptiles. Mutation or overexpression of MHZ5 also alters the expression of ethylene-responsive genes. Genetic studies revealed that the MHZ5-mediated ABA pathway acts downstream of ethylene signaling to inhibit root growth. The MHZ5-mediated ABA pathway likely acts upstream but negatively regulates ethylene signaling to control coleoptile growth. Our study reveals novel interactions among ethylene, carotenogenesis, and ABA and provides insight into improvements in agronomic traits and adaptive growth through the manipulation of these pathways in rice.
25901084	The Tyrosine Aminomutase TAM1 Is Required for β-Tyrosine Biosynthesis in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	Non-protein amino acids, often isomers of the standard 20 protein amino acids, have defense-related functions in many plant species. A targeted search for jasmonate-induced metabolites in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) identified (R)-β-tyrosine, an isomer of the common amino acid (S)-α-tyrosine in the seeds, leaves, roots, and root exudates of the Nipponbare cultivar. Assays with 119 diverse cultivars showed a distinct presence/absence polymorphism, with β-tyrosine being most prevalent in temperate japonica cultivars. Genetic mapping identified a candidate gene on chromosome 12, which was confirmed to encode a tyrosine aminomutase (TAM1) by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and in vitro enzyme assays. A point mutation in TAM1 eliminated β-tyrosine production in Nipponbare. Rice cultivars that do not produce β-tyrosine have a chromosome 12 deletion that encompasses TAM1. Although β-tyrosine accumulation was induced by the plant defense signaling molecule jasmonic acid, bioassays with hemipteran and lepidopteran herbivores showed no negative effects at physiologically relevant β-tyrosine concentrations. In contrast, root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana and other tested dicot plants was inhibited by concentrations as low as 1 μM. As β-tyrosine is exuded into hydroponic medium at higher concentrations, it may contribute to the allelopathic potential of rice.

25895479	Systematic analysis of maize class III peroxidase gene family reveals a conserved subfamily involved in abiotic stress response.	2015	Gene	Class III peroxidases (PRXs) are plant-specific enzymes that play key roles in the responses to biotic and abiotic stress during plant growth and development. In this study, we identified 119 nonredundant PRX genes (designated ZmPRXs). These PRX genes were divided into 18 groups based on their phylogenetic relationships. We performed systematic bioinformatics analysis of the PRX genes, including analysis of gene structures, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships and gene expression profiles. The ZmPRXs are unevenly distributed on the 10 maize chromosomes. In addition, these genes have undergone 16 segmental duplication and 12 tandem duplication events, indicating that both segmental and tandem duplication were the main contributors to the expansion of the maize PRX family. Ka/Ks analysis suggested that most duplicated ZmPRXs experienced purifying selection, with limited functional divergence during the duplication events, and comparative analysis among maize, sorghum and rice revealed that there were independent duplication events besides the whole-genome duplication of the maize genome. Furthermore, microarray analysis indicated that most highly expressed genes might play significant roles in root. We examined the expression of five candidate ZmPRXs under H2O2, SA, NaCl and PEG stress conditions using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), revealing differential expression patterns. This study provides useful information for further functional analysis of the PRX gene family in maize.
25841039	Axillary Meristem Formation in Rice Requires the WUSCHEL Ortholog TILLERS ABSENT1.	2015	Plant Cell	Axillary shoot formation is a key determinant of plant architecture. Formation of the axillary shoot is regulated by initiation of the axillary meristem or outgrowth of the axillary bud. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1; also known as Os WUS), an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana WUS, is required to initiate axillary meristem development. We found that formation of the axillary meristem in rice proceeds via a transient state, which we term the premeristem, characterized by the expression of OSH1, a marker of indeterminate cells in the shoot apical meristem. In the tab1-1 (wus-1) mutant, however, formation of the axillary meristem is arrested at various stages of the premeristem zone, and OSH1 expression is highly reduced. TAB1/WUS is expressed in the premeristem zone, where it shows a partially overlapping pattern with OSH1. It is likely, therefore, that TAB1 plays an important role in maintaining the premeristem zone and in promoting the formation of the axillary meristem by promoting OSH1 expression. Temporal expression patterns of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) indicate that WOX4 is likely to regulate meristem maintenance instead of TAB1 after establishment of the axillary meristem. Lastly, we show that the prophyll, the first leaf in the secondary axis, is formed from the premeristem zone and not from the axillary meristem.
25893776	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	The molecular mechanism of iron (Fe) uptake and transport in plants are well-characterized; however, many components of Fe homeostasis remain unclear. We cloned iron-deficiency-regulated oligopeptide transporter 7 (OsOPT7) from rice. OsOPT7 localized to the plasma membrane and did not transport Fe(III)-DMA or Fe(II)-NA and GSH in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Furthermore OsOPT7 did not complement the growth of yeast fet3fet4 mutant. OsOPT7 was specifically upregulated in response to Fe-deficiency. Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development. Microarray analysis of OsOPT7 knockout 1 (opt7-1) revealed the upregulation of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes in plants grown under Fe-sufficient conditions, despite the high Fe and ferritin concentrations in shoot tissue indicating that Fe may not be available for physiological functions. Plants overexpressing OsOPT7 do not exhibit any phenotype and do not accumulate more Fe compared to wild type plants. These results indicate that OsOPT7 may be involved in Fe transport in rice.
25922483	OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Grain shape and weight are two determining agronomic traits of rice yield. ABC1 (Activity of bc1 complex) is a newly found atypical kinase in plants. Here, we report on an ABC1 protein kinase gene, OsAGSW1 (ABC1-like kinase related to Grain size and Weight). Expression of OsAGSW1-GFP in rice revealed that OsAGSW1 is localized to the chloroplasts in rice. Analysis of OsAGSW1 promoter::β-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene was highly expressed in vascular bundles in shoot, hull and caryopsis. Furthermore, OsAGSW1-RNAi and overexpressed transgenic rice lines were generated. Stable transgenic lines overexpressing OsAGSW1 exhibited a phenotype with a significant increase in grain size, grain weight, grain filling rate and 1000-grain weight compared with the wild-type and RNAi transgenic plants. Microscopy analysis showed that spikelet hulls just before heading were different in the OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type and OsAGSW1 RNAi rice. Further cytological analysis showed that the number of external parenchyma cells in rice hulls of OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants increased, leading to wider and longer spikelet hulls than those of the wild-type and OsAGSW1-RNAi plants. The vascular cross-sectional area in lemma, carpopodium and ovules also strikingly increased and area of both xylem and phloem were enlarged in the OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants. Thus, our results demonstrated that OsAGSW1 plays an important role in seed shape and size of rice by regulating the number of external parenchyma cells and the development of vascular bundles, providing a new insight into the functions of ABC1 genes in plants.
25711814	OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.	2015	Plant Sci	Iron is abundant in the soil, but its low solubility in neutral or alkaline soils limits its uptake. Plants can rely on rhizosphere acidification to increase iron solubility. OsSEC27p was previously found to be a highly up-regulated gene in iron-deficient rice roots. Here, pH-dependent complementation assays using yeast mutants sec24Δ/SEC24 and sec27Δ/SEC27 showed that OsSEC27 could functionally complement SEC24 but not SEC27 in yeast; thus, it was renamed as OsSEC24. We found that OsSEC24-transgenic tobacco plants increased the length and number of roots under iron deficiency at pH 8.0. To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts. H(+) flux measurements using Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) indicated that the transgenic OsSEC24 tobacco and rice enhanced H(+) efflux under iron deficiency. Conversely, the application of plasma membrane PM-H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate elucidated that H(+) secretion increased by OsSEC24 was mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase. OsPMA2 was used as a representative of iron deficiency-responsive PM-H(+)-ATPases in rice root via RT-PCR analysis. In transgenic rice protoplasts OsPMA2 was packaged into OsSEC24 vesicles after export from the ER through confocal-microscopy observation. Together, OsSEC24 vesicles, along with PM-H(+)-ATPases stimulate roots formation under iron deficiency by enhancing rhizosphere acidification.
25886365	ABA inducible rice protein phosphatase 2C confers ABA insensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2015	PLoS One	Arabidopsis PP2C belonging to group A have been extensively worked out and known to negatively regulate ABA signaling. However, rice (Oryza sativa) orthologs of Arabidopsis group A PP2C are scarcely characterized functionally. We have identified a group A PP2C from rice (OsPP108), which is highly inducible under ABA, salt and drought stresses and localized predominantly in the nucleus. Genetic analysis revealed that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP108 are highly insensitive to ABA and tolerant to high salt and mannitol stresses during seed germination, root growth and overall seedling growth. At adult stage, OsPP108 overexpression leads to high tolerance to salt, mannitol and drought stresses with far better physiological parameters such as water loss, fresh weight, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic potential (Fv/Fm) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Expression profile of various stress marker genes in OsPP108 overexpressing plants revealed interplay of ABA dependent and independent pathway for abiotic stress tolerance. Overall, this study has identified a potential rice group A PP2C, which regulates ABA signaling negatively and abiotic stress signaling positively. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing this gene might provide an answer to the problem of low crop yield and productivity during adverse environmental conditions.
25754802	OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor that affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.	2015	Plant J	Plant height and flowering time are key agronomic traits affecting yield in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we investigated the functions in rice growth and development of OsNAC2, encoding a NAC transcription factor in rice. Transgenic plants that constitutively expressed OsNAC2 had shorter internodes, shorter spikelets, and were more insensitive to gibberellic acid (GA(3)). In addition, the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, compared with the wild-type. Moreover, flowering was delayed for approximately 5 days in transgenic lines. The transcription of Hd3a, a flowering-time related gene, was suppressed in transgenic lines. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsNAC2 were also more insensitive to GA(3). The expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes OsKO2 and OsKAO were repressed. The expression of OsSLRL, encoding a repressor in the GA signal pathway, and OsEATB, which encodes a repressor of GA biosynthesis, were both enhanced. Western blotting indicated that DELLA also accumulated at the protein level. Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2. Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice.
25850808	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	In the facultative long-day (LD) plant Arabidopsis thaliana, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) is activated by blue light and promotes flowering through the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of CONSTANS under inductive LD conditions. By contrast, the facultative short day (SD) plant rice (Oryza sativa) flowers early under inductive SD and late under non-inductive LD conditions; the regulatory function of OsFKF1 remains elusive. Here we show that osfkf1 mutants flower late under SD, LD and natural LD conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsFKF1 up-regulates the expression of the floral activator Ehd2 and down-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7; these regulators up- and down-regulate Ehd1 expression, respectively. Moreover, OsFKF1 can up-regulate Ehd1 expression under blue light treatment, without affecting the expression of Ehd2 and Ghd7. In contrast to the LD-specific floral activator Arabidopsis FKF1, OsFKF1 likely acts as an autonomous floral activator because it promotes flowering independent of photoperiod, probably via its distinct roles in controlling the expression of rice-specific genes including Ehd2, Ghd7 and Ehd1. Like Arabidopsis FKF1, which interacts with GI and CDF1, OsFKF1 also interacts with OsGI and OsCDF1 (also termed OsDOF12). Thus, we have identified similar and distinct roles of FKF1 in Arabidopsis and rice.
25903544	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The green - revertible yellow79 mutant resulting from a single-base mutation suggested that the GRY79 gene encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice. Functional studies of metallo-β-lactamases and trihelix transcription factors in higher plants remain very sparse. In this study, we isolated the green-revertible yellow79 (gry79) mutant in rice. The mutant developed yellow-green leaves before the three-leaf stage but recovered to normal green at the sixth-leaf stage. Meanwhile, the mutant exhibited reduced level of chlorophylls and arrested development of chloroplasts in the yellow leaves. Genetic analysis suggested that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene on rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning revealed that the candidate gene was Os02g33610 encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera. In the gry79 mutant, a single-base mutation occurred in coding region of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. Furthermore, the mutant phenotype was rescued by transformation with the wild-type gene. Therefore, we have confirmed that the gry79 mutant phenotype resulted from a single-base mutation in GRY79 (Os02g33610) gene, suggesting that the gene encoding a putative metallo-β-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice. In addition, we considered that the gry79 mutant gene could be applicable as a leaf-color marker gene for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production.
25711812	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Rice is a major food source for much of the world, and expanding our knowledge of genes conferring specific rice grain attributes will benefit both farmer and consumer. Here we present novel dull grain mutants with a low amylose content (AC) derived from mutagenesis of Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica cv. Taikeng 8 (TK8). Positional cloning of the gene conferring the dull grain phenotype revealed a point mutation located at the acceptor splice site of intron 11 of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2), encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR)-containing protein. Three novel flo2 alleles were identified herein, which surprisingly conferred dull rather than floury grains. The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL. The effect of the flo2 mutations on the physicochemical properties of the grain included a low breakdown, setback, and consistency of rice, indicating a good elasticity and soft texture of cooked rice grains. The effects of FLO2, combined with the genetic background of the germplasm and environmental effects, resulted in a variety of different amylose content levels, grain appearance, and physicochemical properties of rice, providing a host of useful information to future grain-quality research and breeding.
25902049	Characterization of the Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme Gene Family in Rice and Evaluation of Expression Profiles under Abiotic Stresses and Hormone Treatments.	2015	PLoS One	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2s (UBCs), which catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate or E3 ligases, are key enzymes in ubiquitination modifications of target proteins. However, little is known about the knowledge of UBC gene family in rice. In this study, a total of 39 UBC encoding genes, which all contained an UBC domain with a cysteine active site, were identified in the rice genome. These were classified into fifteen distinct subfamilies based upon their sequence similarity and phylogenetic relationships. A subset of 19 OsUBC genes exhibited chromosomal duplication; 4 and 15 OsUBC genes were tandemly and segmentally duplicated, respectively. Comprehensive analyses were performed to investigate the expression profiles of OsUBC genes in various stages of vegetative and reproductive development using data from EST, Microarrays, MPSS, and real-time PCR. Many OsUBC genes exhibited abundant and tissue-specific expression patterns. Moreover, 14 OsUBCs were found to be differentially expressed under treatments with drought, or salt stresses. The expression analysis after treatments with IAA, 6-BA, GA and ABA indicated that almost all OsUBC genes were responsive to at least two of the four hormones. Several genes were significantly down-regulated under all of the hormone treatments, and most of the genes reduced by 6-BA were also reduced by GA. This study will facilitate further studies of the OsUBC gene family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsUBCs in rice.
25856151	Unraveling the intricate nexus of molecular mechanisms governing rice root development: OsMPK3/6 and auxin-cytokinin interplay.	2015	PLoS One	The root system is an imperative component of a plant, involved in water and nutrient acquisition from the soil. Any subtle change in the root system may lead to drastic changes in plant productivity. Both auxin and cytokinin are implicated in regulating various root developmental aspects. One of the major signaling cascades facilitating various hormonal and developmental allocations is the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade. Innumerable efforts have been made to unravel the complex nexus involved in rice root development. In spite of a plethora of studies, a comprehensive study aiming to decipher the plausible cross-talk of MAPK signaling module with auxin and cytokinin signaling components in rice is missing. In the present study, extensive phenomics analysis of different stages of rice roots; transcript profiling by qRT-PCR of entire gene family of MAPK, MAPKK and PIN genes; as well as protein level and activity of potential MAPKs was investigated using western and immuno kinase assays both on auxin and cytokinin treatment. The above study led to the identification of various novel rice root specific phenotypic traits by using GiA roots software framework. High expression profile of OsMPK3/6, OsMKK4/5 and OsPIN 1b/9 and their marked transcript level modulation in response to both auxin and cytokinin was observed. Finally, the protein levels and activity assay further substantiated our present findings. Thus, OsMPK3/6-OsMKK4/5 module is elucidated as the putative, key player in auxin-cytokinin interaction augmenting their role by differentially regulating the expression patterns of OsPIN 1b/9 in root development in rice.
25925167	OsTCP19 influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.	2015	Sci Rep	Class-I TCP transcription factors are plant-specific developmental regulators. In this study, the role of one such rice gene, OsTCP19, in water-deficit and salt stress response was explored. Besides a general upregulation by abiotic stresses, this transcript was more abundant in tolerant than sensitive rice genotypes during early hours of stress. Stress, tissue and genotype-dependent retention of a small in-frame intron in this transcript was also observed. Overexpression of OsTCP19 in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation. Moreover, decrease in water loss and reactive oxygen species, and hyperaccumulation of lipid droplets in the transgenics contributed to better stress tolerance both during seedling establishment and in mature plants. OsTCP19 was also shown to directly regulate a rice triacylglycerol biosynthesis gene in transient assays. Genes similar to those up- or downregulated in the transgenics were accordingly found to coexpress positively and negatively with OsTCP19 in Rice Oligonucleotide Array Database. Interactions of OsTCP19 with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure. Thus, OsTCP19 appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways.
25893869	OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice. The root system plays important roles in plant nutrient and water acquisition. However, mechanisms of root development and molecular regulation in rice are still poorly understood. Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant with shortened roots due to a defect in cell elongation. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI. OsKASI was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout the plant and OsKASI protein was localized in the plastid. In addition, OsKASI deficiency resulted in reduced fertility and a remarkable change in fatty acid (FA) composition and contents in roots and seeds. Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice.
25863286	Active site cleft mutants of Os9BGlu31 transglucosidase modify acceptor substrate specificity and allow production of multiple kaempferol glycosides.	2015	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: Rice Os9BGlu31 is a transglucosidase that can transfer glucose to phenolic acids, flavonoids, and phytohormones. Os9BGlu31 displays a broad specificity with phenolic 1-O-β-D-glucose esters acting as better glucose donors than glucosides, whereas the free phenolic acids of these esters are also excellent acceptor substrates.

METHODS: Based on homology modeling of this enzyme, we made single point mutations of residues surrounding the acceptor binding region of the Os9BGlu31 active site. Products of the wild type and mutant enzymes in transglycosylation of phenolic acceptors from 4-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside donor were identified and measured by UPLC and negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS).

RESULTS: The most active variant produced was W243N, while I172T and L183Q mutations decreased the activity, and other mutations at W243 (A, D, M, N, F and Y) had variable effects, depending on the acceptor substrate. The Os9BGlu31 W243N mutant activity was higher than that of wild type on phenolic acids and kaempferol, a flavonol containing 4 hydroxyl groups, and the wild type Os9BGlu31 produced only a single product from each of these acceptors in significant amounts, while W243 variants produced multiple glucoconjugates. Fragmentation analysis provisionally identified the kaempferol transglycosylation products as kaempferol 3-O, 7-O, and 4'-O glucosides and 3,7-O, 4',7-O, and 3,4'-O bis-O-glucosides. The Os9BGlu31 W243 mutants were also better able to use kaempferol 3-O-glucoside as a donor substrate.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The W243 residue was found to be critical to the substrate and product specificity of Os9BGlu31 transglucosidase and mutation of this residue allows production of a range of glucoconjugates.
25907566	Transport Function of Rice Amino Acid Permeases (AAPs).	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The transport function of four rice (Oryza sativa) amino acid permeases (AAPs), OsAAP1 (Os07g04180), OsAAP3 (Os06g36180), OsAAP7 (Os05g34980) and OsAAP16 (Os12g08090), was analyzed by expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and electrophysiology. OsAAP1, OsAAP7 and OsAAP16 functioned, similarly to Arabidopsis AAPs, as general amino acid permeases. OsAAP3 had a distinct substrate specificity compared with other rice or Arabidopsis AAPs. OsAAP3 transported the basic amino acids lysine and arginine well but selected against aromatic amino acids. The transport of basic amino acids was further analyzed for OsAAP1 and OsAAP3, and the results support the transport of both neutral and positively charged forms of basic amino acids by the rice AAPs. Cellular localization using the tandem enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter pHusion showed that OsAAP1 and OsAAP3 localized to the plasma membrane after transient expression in onion epidermal cells or stable expression in Arabidopsis.
25855237	Expression of Rice Mature Carbonic Anhydrase Gene Increase E. coli Tolerance to Heat Stress.	2015	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Carbonic anhydrate is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme and involved in plant abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, we found that heat stress could induce rice mature carbonic anhydrate gene over-expression in rice plants. An Escherichia coli heterologous expression system was performed to identify the function of rice mature carbonic anhydrate in vitro. By sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), mature OsCA fusion protein was identified and proved to be soluble. The results of spot, survival rate, and growth curve assay demonstrated that the expression of the mature OsCA could enhance the thermo-tolerance of the induced mature OsCA recombinants in comparison with controls under heat stress. Meanwhile, compared with controls, the levels of reactive oxygen species in induced mature OsCA recombinants were apparently low under heat stress, and correspondingly, activities of the critical antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase in the induced mature OsCA recombinants were significantly increased. Additionally, relative to controls, the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase decreased in the induced mature OsCA recombinants under heat stress. Based on these results, we suggest that mature OsCA protein could confer the E. coli recombinants' tolerance to heat stress by a synergistic fashion of increasing the antioxidant enzymes' activities to reduce the oxidative damage and maintaining the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of E. coli.
25847193	Rice cyclophilin OsCYP18-2 is translocated to the nucleus by an interaction with SKIP and enhances drought tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Cyclophilin 18-2 (CYP18-2) genes, homologues of human peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like 1 (PPiL1), are conserved across multicellular organisms and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Although PPiL1 is known to interact with ski-interacting protein (SKIP), a transcriptional co-regulator and spliceosomal component, there have been no functional analyses of PPiL1 homologues in plants. Rice cyclophilin 18-2 (OsCYP18-2) bound directly to amino acids 56-95 of OsSKIP and its binding was independent of cyclosporin A, a cyclophilin-binding drug. Moreover, OsCYP18-2 exhibited PPIase activity regardless of its interaction with OsSKIP. Therefore, the binding site for OsCYP18-2's interaction with SKIP was distinct from the PPIase active site. OsCYP18-2's interaction with SKIP full-length protein enabled OsCYP18-2's translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and AtSKIP interacted in planta with both AtCYP18-2 and OsCYP18-2. Drought and salt stress induced similar expression of OsCYP18-2 and OsSKIP. Overexpression of OsCYP18-2 in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana plants enhanced drought tolerance and altered expression and pre-mRNA splicing patterns of stress-related genes in Arabidopsis under drought conditions. Furthermore, OsCYP18-2 caused transcriptional activation with/without OsSKIP in the GAL4 system of yeast; thus the OsSKIP-OsCYP18-2 interaction has an important role in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of stress-related genes and increases tolerance to drought stress.
25711810	Identification and analysis of the mechanism underlying heat-inducible expression of rice aconitase 1.	2015	Plant Sci	Respiratory metabolism is an important though poorly understood facet of plant adaptation to stress. Posttranslational modification of aconitase, a component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), may be involved in stress tolerance. However, such stress-related transcriptional regulation and its mechanism remain unknown. In this study, we found that expression of the rice Aconitase gene OsACO1 is induced in a time-dependent manner by heat but not other typical abiotic stresses. To analyze the transcriptional regulation mechanism underlying the response to heat, the OsACO1 promoter (POsACO1) was isolated and characterized in transgenic rice. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses, we found that the expression of the GUS reporter gene responded to heat in different tissues and at different stages of development when driven by POsACO1. A series of 5' distal deletions of POsACO1 was generated to delineate the region responsible for heat-induced gene expression. Transient expression analyses in tobacco leaves identified a 322-bp minimal region between -1386 and -1065 as being essential and sufficient for heat-induced expression by POsACO1. We screened for known heat response-related cis-elements in this 322-bp region; however, sequences correlating with heat-induced gene expression were not identified in POsACO1. Therefore, truncations and successive mutagenesis analyses were performed in this 322-bp region. By comparing the activities of promoter fragments and their derivatives, our results indicated that the heat response element resided in a 9-bp region between -1132 and -1124, a sequence that contains a W-box motif. Additional site-directed mutagenesis analyses eliminated the heat response activity of POsACO1 via the W-box element, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated the binding of POsACO1 by factors in the nuclear extracts of heat-stressed rice seedlings in a W-box-dependent manner. Our results illustrate the expression pattern of a key component of the TCA response to abiotic stress and establish a putative regulatory pathway in the transcriptional modulation of rice respiratory metabolism genes in response to heat.
25923512	Disruption of the rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.2 hinders root-to-shoot nitrate transport and vascular development.	2015	Sci Rep	Plants have evolved to express some members of the nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) to uptake and transport nitrate. However, little is known of the physiological and functional roles of this family in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we characterized the vascular specific transporter OsNPF2.2. Functional analysis using cDNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that OsNPF2.2 is a low-affinity, pH-dependent nitrate transporter. Use of a green fluorescent protein tagged OsNPF2.2 showed that the transporter is located in the plasma membrane in the rice protoplast. Expression analysis showed that OsNPF2.2 is nitrate inducible and is mainly expressed in parenchyma cells around the xylem. Disruption of OsNPF2.2 increased nitrate concentration in the shoot xylem exudate when nitrate was supplied after a deprivation period; this result suggests that OsNPF2.2 may participate in unloading nitrate from the xylem. Under steady-state nitrate supply, the osnpf2.2 mutants maintained high levels of nitrate in the roots and low shoot:root nitrate ratios; this observation suggests that OsNPF2.2 is involved in root-to-shoot nitrate transport. Mutation of OsNPF2.2 also caused abnormal vasculature and retarded plant growth and development. Our findings demonstrate that OsNPF2.2 can unload nitrate from the xylem to affect the root-to-shoot nitrate transport and plant development.
25807334	Comprehensive analysis of regulatory elements of the promoters of rice sulfate transporter gene family and functional characterization of OsSul1;1 promoter under different metal stress.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Adverse environmental conditions including heavy metal stress impose severe effects on the plant growth and development limiting productivity and yield. Studies demonstrated that changes in genome-wide expression modulate various biochemical processes and molecular components in response to heavy metal stress in plants. Some of the key components involved in such a regulation are the transcription initiation machinery, nucleotide sequence of promoters and presence of cis-acting elements. Therefore, identification of the putative cis-acting DNA sequences involved in gene regulation and functional characterization of promoters are important steps in understanding response of plants to heavy metal stress. In this study, comprehensive analysis of the proximal promoters of members of rice sulfate transporter gene family which is an essential component of stress response has been carried out. Analysis suggests presence of various common stress related cis-acting elements in the promoters of members of this gene family. In addition, transcriptional regulation of the arsenic-responsive high affinity sulfate transporter, OsSul1;1, has been studied through development of Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing reporter gene encoding β-glucuronidase under the control of OsSul1;1 promoter. Analysis of the transgenic lines suggests differential response of the OsSul1;1 promoter to various heavy metals as well as other abiotic stresses.
25854544	Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Proteins containing a placenta-specific 8 domain (PLAC8) function as major organ size regulators in Solanum lycopersicum and Zea may, and putative metal ion transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Brassica juncea. However, it is unknown how PLAC8 domain-containing proteins fulfill such diverse roles. Here, we found that plant cadmium resistance 1 (PCR1) influences both zinc (Zn) accumulation and grain weight in rice. OsPCR1 knockout and knockdown lines produced lighter grains than the wild type, while OsPCR1 overexpression lines produced heavier grains. Furthermore, the grains of OsPCR1 knockdown lines exhibited substantially higher Zn and lower cadmium (Cd) concentrations than the control, as did yeast heterologously expressing OsPCR1. Through sequence analysis, we showed that the amino acid sequence of japonica-type PCR1 was distinct from that of indica-type and wild rice accessions. This difference was correlated with distinct Zn-related phenotypes. Japonica-type PCR1 had a shorter N-terminus than did PCR1 in the other rice types, and yeast heterologously expressing japonica-type PCR1 was more sensitive to Zn than was yeast expressing indica-type PCR1. Furthermore, japonica-type grains accumulated less Zn than did indica-type grains. Our study suggests that rice PCR1 maintains metal ion homeostasis and grain weight and might have been selected for during domestication.
25910649	Constitutive over-expression of rice chymotrypsin protease inhibitor gene OCPI2 results in enhanced growth, salinity and osmotic stress tolerance of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Protease inhibitors are involved primarily in defense against pathogens. In recent years, these proteins have also been widely implicated in response of plants to diverse abiotic stresses. Rice chymotrypsin protease inhibitor gene OCPI2 is highly induced under salt and osmotic stresses. The construct containing the complete coding sequence of OCPI2 cloned downstream to CaMV35S promoter was transformed in Arabidopsis and single copy, homozygous transgenic lines were produced. The transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to NaCl, PEG and mannitol stress as compared to wild type plants. Importantly, the vegetative and reproductive growth of transgenic plants under unstressed, control conditions was also enhanced: transgenic plants were more vigorous than wild type, resulting into higher yield in terms of silique number. The RWC values and membrane stability index of transgenic in comparison to wild type plants was higher. Higher proline content was observed in the AtOCPI2 lines, which was associated with higher transcript expression of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase and lowered levels of proline dehydrogenase genes. The chymotrypsin protease activities were lower in the transgenic as against wild type plants, under both unstressed, control as well as stressed conditions. It thus appears that rice chymotrypsin protease inhibitor gene OCPI2 is a useful candidate gene for genetic improvement of plants against salt and osmotic stress.
25869654	The presence of fucogalactoxyloglucan and its synthesis in rice indicates conserved functional importance in plants.	2015	Plant Physiol	The predominant structure of the hemicellulose xyloglucan (XyG) found in the cell walls of dicots is a fucogalactoXyG with an XXXG core motif, whereas in the Poaceae (grasses and cereals), the structure of XyG is less xylosylated (XXGGn core motif) and lacks fucosyl residues. However, specialized tissues of rice (Oryza sativa) also contain fucogalactoXyG. Orthologous genes of the fucogalactoXyG biosynthetic machinery of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are present in the rice genome. Expression of these rice genes, including fucosyl-, galactosyl-, and acetyltransferases, in the corresponding Arabidopsis mutants confirmed their activity and substrate specificity, indicating that plants in the Poaceae family have the ability to synthesize fucogalactoXyG in vivo. The data presented here provide support for a functional conservation of XyG structure in higher plants.
25860838	Full establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice occurs independently of enzymatic jasmonate biosynthesis.	2015	PLoS One	Development of the mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis between most land plants and fungi of the Glomeromycota is regulated by phytohormones. The role of jasmonate (JA) in AM colonization has been investigated in the dicotyledons Medicago truncatula, tomato and Nicotiana attenuata and contradicting results have been obtained with respect to a neutral, promotive or inhibitory effect of JA on AM colonization. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether JA plays a role in AM colonization of monocotyledonous roots. Therefore we examined whether JA biosynthesis is required for AM colonization of the monocot rice. To this end we employed the rice mutant constitutive photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2), which is deficient in JA biosynthesis. Through a time course experiment the amount and morphology of fungal colonization did not differ between wild-type and cpm2 roots. Furthermore, no significant difference in the expression of AM marker genes was detected between wild type and cpm2. However, treatment of wild-type roots with 50 μM JA lead to a decrease of AM colonization and this was correlated with induction of the defense gene PR4. These results indicate that JA is not required for AM colonization of rice but high levels of JA in the roots suppress AM development likely through the induction of defense.
25855537	MORF-RELATED GENE702, a Reader Protein of Trimethylated Histone H3 Lysine 4 and Histone H3 Lysine 36, Is Involved in Brassinosteroid-Regulated Growth and Flowering Time Control in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	The methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) plays critical roles in brassinosteroid (BR)-related processes and is involved in controlling flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa). Although enzymes that catalyze this methylation reaction have been described, little is known about the recognition mechanisms to decipher H3K36 methylation information in rice. In this study, biochemical characterizations showed that MORF-RELATED GENE702 (MRG702) binds to trimethylated H3K4 and H3K36 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) in vitro. Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP725 (SDG725), the MRG702 knockdown mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes. Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knockdown resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including DWARF11, BRASSINOSTEROD INSENSITIVE1, and BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, and several flowering genes, including Early heading date1 (Ehd1), Ehd2, Ehd3, OsMADS50, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1. A binding analysis showed that MRG702 directly binds to the chromatin at target gene loci. This binding is dependent on the level of trimethylated H3K36, which is mediated by SDG725. Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725. Therefore, the role of MRG702 in the BR pathway and in controlling flowering time in rice is to function as a reader protein to decipher methylation information.
25884488	Correction: The RhoGAP SPIN6 associates with SPL11 and OsRac1 and negatively regulates programmed cell death and innate immunity in rice.	2015	PLoS Pathog	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004629.].
25896119	Identification and expression of two novel cytochrome P450 genes, CYP6CV1 and CYP9A38, in Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	2015	J Insect Sci	Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Güenée can cause severe losses in rice. Cytochrome P450s play crucial roles in the metabolism of allelochemicals in herbivorous insects. Two novel P450 cDNAs, CYP6CV1 and CYP9A38, were cloned from the midgut of C. medinalis. CYP6CV1 encodes a protein of 500 amino acid residues, while CYP9A38-predicted protein has 531 amino acid residues. Both cDNA-predicted proteins contain the conserved functional domains for all P450s. Phylogenetic analyses showed that CYP6CV1 is grouped in the cluster containing CYP6B members, while CYP9A38 is in the cluster including CYP9 members. However, both clusters are contained in the same higher lineage. Homologous analysis revealed that CYP6CV1 is most similar to CYP6B8, CYP6B7, CYP6B6, CYP6B2, and CYP6B4 with the highest amino acid identity of 41%. CYP9A38 is closest to CYP9A17, CYP9A21, CYP9A20, and CYP9A19 with the highest amino acid identity of 66%. Studies of temporal expression profiles revealed that CYP9A38 showed a steady increase in mRNA level during the five instar stages, but a low-expression level in pupae, and then presented at a high-expression level again in adults. Similar expression patterns were obtained with CYP6CV1. In the fifth instar larvae, CYP6CV1 was mainly expressed in midgut and fat bodies, whereas CYP9A38 was mainly expressed in midgut. Expression studies also revealed a 3.20-fold over-expression of CYP6CV1 and 3.54-fold over-expression of CYP9A38 after larval exposure to host rice resistance. Our results suggest that both CYP6CV1 and CYP9A38 may be involved in detoxification of rice phytochemicals.
25869921	Development and evaluation of near-isogenic lines for major blast resistance gene(s) in Basmati rice.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A set of NILs carrying major blast resistance genes in a Basmati rice variety has been developed. Also, the efficacy of pyramids over monogenic NILs against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae has been demonstrated. Productivity and quality of Basmati rice is severely affected by rice blast disease. Major genes and QTLs conferring resistance to blast have been reported only in non-Basmati rice germplasm. Here, we report incorporation of seven blast resistance genes from the donor lines DHMASQ164-2a (Pi54, Pi1, Pita), IRBLz5-CA (Pi2), IRBLb-B (Pib), IRBL5-M (Pi5) and IRBL9-W (Pi9) into the genetic background of an elite Basmati rice variety Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1). A total of 36 near-isogenic lines (NILs) comprising of 14 monogenic, 16 two-gene pyramids and six three-gene pyramids were developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Foreground, recombinant and background selection was used to identify the plants with target gene(s), minimize the linkage drag and increase the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery (93.5-98.6 %), respectively, in the NILs. Comparative analysis performed using 50,051 SNPs and 500 SSR markers revealed that the SNPs provided better insight into the RPG recovery. Most of the monogenic NILs showed comparable performance in yield and quality, concomitantly, Pusa1637-18-7-6-20 (Pi9), was significantly superior in yield and stable across four different environments as compared to recurrent parent (RP) PB1. Further, among the pyramids, Pusa1930-12-6 (Pi2+Pi5) showed significantly higher yield and Pusa1633-7-8-53-6-8 (Pi54+Pi1+Pita) was superior in cooking quality as compared to RP PB1. The NILs carrying gene Pi9 were found to be the most effective against the concoction of virulent races predominant in the hotspot locations for blast disease. Conversely, when analyzed under artificial inoculation, three-gene pyramids expressed enhanced resistance as compared to the two-gene and monogenic NILs.
25740115	Hd3a promotes lateral branching in rice.	2015	Plant J	Accumulating evidence indicates that the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein is the mobile floral signal known as florigen. A rice FT homolog, Heading date 3a (Hd3a), is transported from the phloem to shoot apical cells, where it interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and transcription factor OsFD1 to form a florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates a rice homolog of the floral identity gene APETALA1. Recent studies showed that florigen has roles in plant development beyond flowering; however, the exact nature of these roles is not well understood. It is not clear whether FT is transported to organs outside the shoot apex, and whether FAC formation is required for processes other than flowering. We show here that the Hd3a protein accumulates in axillary meristems to promote branching, and that FAC formation is required. Analysis of transgenic plants revealed that Hd3a promotes branching through lateral bud outgrowth. Hd3a protein produced in the phloem reached the axillary meristem in the lateral bud, and its transport was required for promotion of branching. Moreover, mutant Hd3a proteins defective in FAC formation but competent with respect to transport did not promote branching. Finally, we show that Hd3a promotes branching independently from strigolactone and FC1, a transcription factor that inhibits branching in rice. Together, these results suggest that Hd3a functions as a mobile signal for branching in rice.
25888593	A strigolactone signal is required for adventitious root formation in rice.	2015	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Strigolactones (SLs) and their derivatives are plant hormones that have recently been identified as regulating root development. This study examines whether SLs play a role in mediating production of adventious roots (ARs) in rice (Oryza sativa), and also investigates possible interactions between SLs and auxin.

METHODS: Wild-type (WT), SL-deficient (d10) and SL-insensitive (d3) rice mutants were used to investigate AR development in an auxin-distribution experiment that considered DR5::GUS activity, [(3)H] indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) transport, and associated expression of auxin transporter genes. The effects of exogenous application of GR24 (a synthetic SL analogue), NAA (α-naphthylacetic acid, exogenous auxin) and NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, a polar auxin transport inhibitor) on rice AR development in seedlings were investigated.

KEY RESULTS: The rice d mutants with impaired SL biosynthesis and signalling exhibited reduced AR production compared with the WT. Application of GR24 increased the number of ARs and average AR number per tiller in d10, but not in d3. These results indicate that rice AR production is positively regulated by SLs. Higher endogenous IAA concentration, stronger expression of DR5::GUS and higher [(3)H] IAA activity were found in the d mutants. Exogenous GR24 application decreased the expression of DR5::GUS, probably indicating that SLs modulate AR formation by inhibiting polar auxin transport. The WT and the d10 and d3 mutants had similar expression of DR5::GUS regardless of exogenous application of NAA or NPA; however, AR number was greater in the WT than in the d mutants.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that AR formation is positively regulated by SLs via the D3 response pathway. The positive effect of NAA application and the opposite effect of NPA application on AR number of WT plants also suggests the importance of auxin for AR formation, but the interaction between auxin and SLs is complex.
25849038	A novel pyrimidin-like plant activator stimulates plant disease resistance and promotes growth.	2015	PLoS One	Plant activators are chemicals that induce plant defense responses to a broad spectrum of pathogens. Here, we identified a new potential plant activator, 5-(cyclopropylmethyl)-6-methyl-2-(2-pyridyl)pyrimidin-4-ol, named PPA (pyrimidin-type plant activator). Compared with benzothiadiazole S-methyl ester (BTH), a functional analog of salicylic acid (SA), PPA was fully soluble in water and increased fresh weight of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis plants at low concentrations. In addition, PPA also promoted lateral root development. Microarray data and real-time PCR revealed that PPA-treated leaves not challenged with pathogen showed up-regulation of genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS), defenses and SA. During bacterial infection, Arabidopsis plants pretreated with PPA showed dramatically decreased disease symptoms and an earlier and stronger ROS burst, compared with plants pretreated with BTH. Microscopy revealed that H2O2 accumulated in the cytosol, plasma membrane and cell wall around intracellular bacteria, and also on the bacterial cell wall, indicating that H2O2 was directly involved in killing bacteria. The increase in ROS-related gene expression also supported this observation. Our results indicate that PPA enhances plant defenses against pathogen invasion through the plant redox system, and as a water-soluble compound that can promote plant growth, has broad potential applications in agriculture.
25845410	Differential regulation of toxoflavin production and its role in the enhanced virulence of Burkholderia gladioli.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Burkholderia gladioli is a causal agent of bacterial panicle blight and sheath/grain browning in rice in many countries. Many strains produce the yellow pigment toxoflavin, which is highly toxic to plants, fungi, animals and microorganisms. Although there have been several studies on the toxoflavin biosynthesis system of B. glumae, it is still unclear how B. gladioli activates toxoflavin biosynthesis. In this study, we explored the genomic organization of the toxoflavin system of B. gladioli and its biological functions using comparative genomic analysis between toxoflavin-producing strains (B. glumae BGR1 and B. gladioli BSR3) and a strain not producing toxoflavin (B. gladioli KACC11889). The latter exhibits normal physiological characteristics similar to other B. gladioli strains. Burkholderia gladioli KACC11889 possesses all the genes involved in toxoflavin biosynthesis, but lacks the quorum-sensing (QS) system that functions as an on/off switch for toxoflavin biosynthesis. These data suggest that B. gladioli has evolved to use the QS signalling cascade of toxoflavin production (TofI/TofR of QS → ToxJ or ToxR → tox operons) similar to that in B. glumae. However, some strains may have evolved to eliminate toxoflavin production through deletion of the QS genes. In addition, we demonstrate that the toxoflavin biosynthetic system enhances the virulence of B. gladioli. These findings provide another line of evidence supporting the differential regulation of the toxoflavin system in Burkholderia strains.
25855206	Functional study of a salt-inducible TaSR gene in Triticum aestivum.	2016	Physiol Plant	The gene expression chip of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant under salt stress was used to clone a salt-induced gene with unknown functions. This gene was designated as TaSR (Triticum aestivum salt-response gene) and submitted to GenBank under accession number EF580107. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that gene expression was induced by salt stress. Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) plants expressing TaSR presented higher salt tolerance than the controls, whereas AtSR mutant and RNA interference rice plants were more sensitive to salt. Under salt stress, TaSR reduced Na(+) concentration and improved cellular K(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations; this gene was also localized on the cell membrane. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining and GUS fluorescence quantitative determination were conducted through fragmentation cloning of the TaSR promoter. Salt stress-responsive elements were detected at 588-1074 bp upstream of the start codon. GUS quantitative tests of the full-length promoter in different tissues indicated that promoter activity was highest in the leaf under salt stress. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid screening further showed the correlation of TaSR with TaPRK and TaKPP. In vitro phosphorylation of TaSR and TaPRK2697 showed that TaPRK2697 did not phosphorylate TaSR. This study revealed that the novel TaSR may be used to improve plant tolerance to salt stress.
25902895	Light-hormone interaction in the red-light-induced suppression of photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings.	2016	Protoplasma	Red light perceived by the shoot bottom suppresses photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings mediated by phytochrome A. Shoots of these seedlings grown in red light having their shoot bottom exposed were deficient in chlorophyll and accumulated high concentration of trans-zeatin riboside. However, reduced presence of isopentynyl adenosine, dihydrozeatin riboside was observed in shoots of red-light-grown non-green seedlings in comparison to green seedling. The message abundance of cytokinin receptor (OsHK5), transporters (OsENT1, OsENT2), and response regulators (OsRR4, OsRR10) was downregulated in these red-light-grown non-green seedlings. Attenuation of greening process was reversed by application of exogenous cytokinin analogue, benzyladenine, or supplementing red light with blue light. In the same vein, the suppression of gene expression of cytokinin receptor, transporters, and type-A response regulators was reversed in red-light-grown seedlings treated with benzyladenine suggesting that the disarrayed cytokinin (CK) signaling cascade is responsible for non-greening of seedlings grown in red light. The reversal of red-light-induced suppression of photomorphogenesis by blue light and benzyladenine demonstrates the interaction of light and cytokinin signaling cascades in the regulation of photomorphogenesis. Partial reversal of greening process by exogenous application of benzyladenine suggests, apart from CKs perception, transportation and responsiveness, other factors are also involved in modulation of suppression of photomorphogenesis by red light.
25873666	Increased tolerance to salt stress in OPDA-deficient rice ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE mutants is linked to an increased ROS-scavenging activity.	2015	J Exp Bot	Salinity stress represents a global constraint for rice, the most important staple food worldwide. Therefore the role of the central stress signal jasmonate for the salt response was analysed in rice comparing the responses to salt stress for two jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis rice mutants (cpm2 and hebiba) impaired in the function of ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE (AOC) and their wild type. The aoc mutants were less sensitive to salt stress. Interestingly, both mutants accumulated smaller amounts of Na(+) ions in their leaves, and showed better scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. Leaves of the wild type and JA mutants accumulated similar levels of abscisic acid (ABA) under stress conditions, and the levels of JA and its amino acid conjugate, JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), showed only subtle alterations in the wild type. In contrast, the wild type responded to salt stress by strong induction of the JA precursor 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA), which was not observed in the mutants. Transcript levels of representative salinity-induced genes were induced less in the JA mutants. The absence of 12-OPDA in the mutants correlated not only with a generally increased ROS-scavenging activity, but also with the higher activity of specific enzymes in the antioxidative pathway, such as glutathione S-transferase, and fewer symptoms of damage as, for example, indicated by lower levels of malondialdehyde. The data are interpreted in a model where the absence of OPDA enhanced the antioxidative power in mutant leaves.
25782973	Chloroplastic and cytoplasmic overexpression of sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase in transgenic rice plants is associated with low melatonin production despite high enzyme activity.	2015	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), the penultimate enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis, catalyzes the conversion of serotonin into N-acetylserotonin. Plant SNAT is localized in chloroplasts. To test SNAT localization effects on melatonin synthesis, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing a sheep (Ovis aries) SNAT (OaSNAT) in their chloroplasts and compared melatonin biosynthesis with that of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OaSNAT in their cytoplasm. To localize the OaSNAT in chloroplasts, we used a chloroplast targeting sequence (CTS) from tobacco protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO), which expresses in chloroplasts. The purified recombinant CTS:OaSNAT fusion protein was enzymatically functional and localized in chloroplasts as confirmed by confocal microscopic analysis. The chloroplast-targeted CTS:OaSNAT lines and cytoplasm-expressed OaSNAT lines had similarly high SNAT enzyme activities. However, after cadmium and butafenacil treatments, melatonin production in rice leaves was severalfold lower in the CTS:OaSNAT lines than in the OaSNAT lines. Notably, enhanced SNAT enzyme activity was not directly proportional to the production of N-acetylserotonin, melatonin, or 2-hydroxymelatonin, suggesting that plant SNAT has a role in the homeostatic regulation of melatonin rather than in accelerating melatonin synthesis.
25954322	Genome-wide comparison of Asian and African rice reveals high recent activity of DNA transposons.	2015	Mob DNA	BACKGROUND: DNA (Class II) transposons are ubiquitous in plant genomes. However, unlike for (Class I) retrotransposons, only little is known about their proliferation mechanisms, activity, and impact on genomes. Asian and African rice (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima) diverged approximately 600,000 years ago. Their fully sequenced genomes therefore provide an excellent opportunity to study polymorphisms introduced from recent transposon activity.

RESULTS: We manually analyzed 1,821 transposon related polymorphisms among which we identified 487 loci which clearly resulted from DNA transposon insertions and excisions. In total, we estimate about 4,000 (3.5% of all DNA transposons) to be polymorphic between the two species, indicating a high level of transposable element (TE) activity. The vast majority of the recently active elements are non-autonomous. Nevertheless, we identified multiple potentially functional autonomous elements. Furthermore, we quantified the impacts of insertions and excisions on the adjacent sequences. Transposon insertions were found to be generally precise, creating simple target site duplications. In contrast, excisions almost always go along with the deletion of flanking sequences and/or the insertion of foreign 'filler' segments. Some of the excision-triggered deletions ranged from hundreds to thousands of bp flanking the excision site. Furthermore, we found in some superfamilies unexpectedly low numbers of excisions. This suggests that some excisions might cause such large-scale rearrangements so that they cannot be detected anymore.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the activity of DNA transposons (particularly the excision process) is a major evolutionary force driving the generation of genetic diversity.
25893467	The different effects of starch synthase IIa mutations or variation on endosperm amylose content of barley, wheat and rice are determined by the distribution of starch synthase I and starch branching enzyme IIb between the starch granule and amyloplast stroma.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: The distribution of starch synthase I and starch branching enzyme IIb between the starch granule and amyloplast stroma plays an important role in determining endosperm amylose content of cereal grains. Starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) catalyses the polymerisation of intermediate length glucan chains of amylopectin in the endosperm of cereals. Mutations of SSIIa genes in barley and wheat and inactive SSIIa variant in rice induce similar effects on the starch structure and the amylose content, but the severity of the phenotypes is different. This study compared the levels of transcripts and partitioning of proteins of starch synthase I (SSI) and starch branching enzyme IIb (SBEIIb) inside and outside the starch granules in the developing endosperms of these ssIIa mutants and inactive SSIIa variant. Pleiotropic effects on starch granule-bound proteins suggested that the different effects of SSIIa mutations on endosperm amylose content of barley, wheat and rice are determined by the distribution of SSI and SBEIIb between the starch granule and amyloplast stroma in cereals. Regulation of starch synthesis in ssIIa mutants and inactive SSIIa variant may be at post-translational level or the altered amylopectin structure deprives the affinity of SSI and SBEIIb to amylopectin.
25932456	XocR, a LuxR solo required for virulence in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2015	Front Cell Infect Microbiol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) causes bacterial leaf streak (BLS) in rice, a serious bacterial disease of rice in Asia and parts of Africa. The virulence mechanisms of Xoc are not entirely clear and control measures for BLS are poorly developed. The solo LuxR proteins are widespread and shown to be involved in virulence in some plant associated bacteria (PAB). Here, we have cloned and characterized a PAB LuxR solo from Xoc, named as XocR. Mutation of xocR almost completely impaired the virulence ability of Xoc on host rice, but did not alter the ability to trigger HR (hypersensitive response, a programmed cell death) on non-host (plant) tobacco, suggesting the diversity of function of xocR in host and non-host plants. We also provide evidence to show that xocR is involved in the regulation of growth-independent cell motility in response to a yet-to-be-identified rice signal, as mutation of xocR impaired cell swimming motility of wild-type Rs105 in the presence but not absence of rice macerate. We further found that xocR regulated the transcription of two characterized virulence-associated genes (recN and trpE) in the presence of rice macerate. The promoter regions of recN and trpE possessed a potential binding motif (an imperfect pip box-like element) of XocR, raising the possibility that XocR might directly bind the promoter regions of these two genes to regulate their transcriptional activity. Our studies add a new member of PAB LuxR solos and also provide new insights into the role of PAB LuxR solo in the virulence of Xanthomonas species.
25907061	Enterococcus faecium LKE12 Cell-Free Extract Accelerates Host Plant Growth via Gibberellin and Indole-3-Acetic Acid Secretion.	2015	J Microbiol Biotechnol	The use of microbial extracts containing plant hormones is a promising technique to improve crop growth. Little is known about the effect of bacterial cell-free extracts on plant growth promotion. This study, based on phytohormonal analyses, aimed at exploring the potential mechanisms by which Enterococcus faecium LKE12 enhances plant growth in oriental melon. A bacterial strain, LKE12, was isolated from soil, and further identified as E. faecium by 16S rDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The plant growth-promoting ability of an LKE12 bacterial culture was tested in a gibberellin (GA)-deficient rice dwarf mutant (waito-C) and a normal GA biosynthesis rice cultivar (Hwayongbyeo). E. faecium LKE12 significantly improved the length and biomass of rice shoots in both normal and dwarf cultivars through the secretion of an array of gibberellins (GA1, GA3, GA7, GA8, GA9, GA12, GA19, GA20, GA24, and GA53), as well as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study indicating that E. faecium can produce GAs. Increases in shoot and root lengths, plant fresh weight, and chlorophyll content promoted by E. faecium LKE12 and its cell-free extract inoculated in oriental melon plants revealed a favorable interaction of E. faecium LKE12 with plants. Higher plant growth rates and nutrient contents of magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron, manganese, silicon, zinc, and nitrogen were found in cell-free extract-treated plants than in control plants. The results of the current study suggest that E. faecium LKE12 promotes plant growth by producing GAs and IAA; interestingly, the exogenous application of its cell-free culture extract can be a potential strategy to accelerate plant growth.
25856577	Gene editing by co-transformation of TALEN and chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides on the rice OsEPSPS gene and the inheritance of mutations.	2015	PLoS One	Although several site-speciﬁc nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas, have emerged as powerful tools for targeted gene editing in many organisms, to date, gene targeting (GT) in plants remains a formidable challenge. In the present study, we attempted to substitute a single base in situ on the rice OsEPSPS gene by co-transformation of TALEN with chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (COs), including different strand composition such as RNA/DNA (C1) or DNA/RNA (C2) but contained the same target base to be substituted. In contrast to zero GT event obtained by the co-transformation of TALEN with homologous recombination plasmid (HRP), we obtained one mutant showing target base substitution although accompanied by undesired deletion of 12 bases downstream the target site from the co-transformation of TALEN and C1. In addition to this typical event, we also obtained 16 mutants with different length of base deletions around the target site among 105 calli lines derived from transformation of TALEN alone (4/19) as well as co-transformation of TELAN with either HRP (5/30) or C1 (2/25) or C2 (5/31). Further analysis demonstrated that the homozygous gene-edited mutants without foreign gene insertion could be obtained in one generation. The induced mutations in transgenic generation were also capable to pass to the next generation stably. However, the genotypes of mutants did not segregate normally in T1 population, probably due to lethal mutations. Phenotypic assessments in T1 generation showed that the heterozygous plants with either one or three bases deletion on target sequence, called d1 and d3, were more sensitive to glyphosate and the heterozygous d1 plants had significantly lower seed-setting rate than wild-type.
25849365	Cofactor specificity motifs and the induced fit mechanism in class I ketol-acid reductoisomerases.	2015	Biochem J	Although most sequenced members of the industrially important ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) family are class I enzymes, structural studies to date have focused primarily on the class II KARIs, which arose through domain duplication. In the present study, we present five new crystal structures of class I KARIs. These include the first structure of a KARI with a six-residue β2αB (cofactor specificity determining) loop and an NADPH phosphate-binding geometry distinct from that of the seven- and 12-residue loops. We also present the first structures of naturally occurring KARIs that utilize NADH as cofactor. These results show insertions in the specificity loops that confounded previous attempts to classify them according to loop length. Lastly, we explore the conformational changes that occur in class I KARIs upon binding of cofactor and metal ions. The class I KARI structures indicate that the active sites close upon binding NAD(P)H, similar to what is observed in the class II KARIs of rice and spinach and different from the opening of the active site observed in the class II KARI of Escherichia coli. This conformational change involves a decrease in the bending of the helix that runs between the domains and a rearrangement of the nicotinamide-binding site.
25403809	Effects of elevated ozone concentration on CH4 and N2O emission from paddy soil under fully open-air field conditions.	2015	Glob Chang Biol	We investigated the effects of elevated ozone concentration (E-O3) on CH4 and N2O emission from paddies with two rice cultivars: an inbred Indica cultivar Yangdao 6 (YD6) and a hybrid one II-you 084 (IIY084), under fully open-air field conditions in China. A mean 26.7% enhancement of ozone concentration above the ambient level (A-O3) significantly reduced CH4 emission at tillering and flowering stages leading to a reduction of seasonal integral CH4 emission by 29.6% on average across the two cultivars. The reduced CH4 emission is associated with O3-induced reduction in the whole-plant biomass (-13.2%), root biomass (-34.7%), and maximum tiller number (-10.3%), all of which curbed the carbon supply for belowground CH4 production and its release from submerged soil to atmosphere. Although no significant difference was detected between the cultivars in the CH4 emission response to E-O3, a larger decrease in CH4 emission with IIY084 (-33.2%) than that with YD6 (-7.0%) was observed at tillering stage, which may be due to the larger reduction in tiller number in IIY084 by E-O3. Additionally, E-O3 reduced seasonal mean NOx flux by 5.7% and 11.8% with IIY084 and YD6, respectively, but the effects were not significant statistically. We found that the relative response of CH4 emission to E-O3 was not significantly different from those reported in open-top chamber experiments. This study has thus confirmed that increasing ozone concentration would mitigate the global warming potential of CH4 and suggested consideration of the feedback mechanism between ozone and its precursor emission into the projection of future ozone effects on terrestrial ecosystem.
25641067	Analyses of Ca2+ dynamics using a ubiquitin-10 promoter-driven Yellow Cameleon 3.6 indicator reveal reliable transgene expression and differences in cytoplasmic Ca2+ responses in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) roots.	2015	New Phytol	Ca(2+) signatures are central to developmental processes and adaptive responses in plants. However, high-resolution studies of Ca(2+) dynamics using genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators (GECIs) such as Yellow Cameleon (YC) proteins have so far not been conducted in important model crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). We conducted a comparative study of 35S and ubiquitin-10 (UBQ10) promoter functionality in Arabidopsis thaliana and O. sativa plants expressing the Ca(2+) indicator Yellow Cameleon 3.6 (YC3.6) under control of the UBQ10 or 35S promoter. Ca(2+) signatures in roots of both species were analyzed during exposure to hyperpolarization/depolarization cycles or in response to application of the amino acid glutamate. We found a superior performance of the UBQ10 promoter with regard to expression pattern, levels and expression stabilities in both species. We observed remarkable differences between the two species in the spatiotemporal parameters of the observed Ca(2+) signatures. Rice appeared in general to respond with a lower maximal signal amplitude but greatly increased signal duration when compared with Arabidopsis. Our results identify important advantages to using the UBQ10 promoter in Arabidopsis and rice and in T-DNA mutant backgrounds. Moreover, the observed differences in Ca(2+) signaling in the two species underscore the need for comparative studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Ca(2+) signaling in plants.
25867543	TALEN-mediated targeted mutagenesis produces a large variety of heritable mutations in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN are currently the two systems of choice for genome editing. We have studied the efficiency of the TALEN system in rice as well as the nature and inheritability of TALEN-induced mutations and found important features of this technology. The N287C230 TALEN backbone resulted in low mutation rates (0-6.6%), but truncations in its C-terminal domain dramatically increased efficiency to 25%. In most transgenic T0 plants, TALEN produced a single prevalent mutation accompanied by a variety of low-frequency mutations. For each independent T0 plant, the prevalent mutation was present in most tissues within a single tiller as well as in all tillers examined, suggesting that TALEN-induced mutations occurred very early in the development of the shoot apical meristem. Multigenerational analysis showed that TALEN-induced mutations were stably transmitted to the T1 and T2 populations in a normal Mendelian fashion. In our study, the vast majority of TALEN-induced mutations (~81%) affected multiple bases and ~70% of them were deletions. Our results contrast with published reports for the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice, in which the predominant mutations affected single bases and deletions accounted for only 3.3% of the overall mutations.
25917598	Marker-assisted breeding of a LOX-3-null rice line with improved storability and resistance to preharvest sprouting.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Breakage of the tight linkage between rice seed lipoxygenase - 3 and easy preharvest sprouting trait led to breeding of lines with few stale flavors after long storage and desirable preharvest sprouting resistance. Lipoxygenase-3 (LOX-3) is involved in the production of volatile constituents in stored rice, and the development of stale flavor is delayed in LOX-3 null rice. In the process of breeding new LOX-3-null lines with long storability, we found a close association between LOX-3 and preharvest sprouting resistance. To determine whether this relationship was due to the tight linkage of two genes or the pleiotropic effect of LOX-3, we performed marker-assisted selection using a BC3F3 population derived from crosses between LOX-3-present/preharvest sprouting-resistant lines and LOX-3-null/preharvest susceptible lines. In one individual, a recombination event occurred 13 kb downstream of LOX-3 (RM15750) and a significant quantitative trait locus, namely qPHS3, for easy preharvest sprouting trait (LOD = 10.4) was detected in an 842-kb region between RM15711 and RM15768. Using BC3F4 and BC3F5 populations, we succeeded in selecting LOX-3-absent and preharvest sprouting-resistant lines with only a 393-kb introgressed chromosome segment from the donor line for LOX-3-null at the LOX-3 locus on chromosome 3. This result indicated that the LOX-3 gene and the locus affecting preharvest sprouting are distinct. The selected line was named 'Hokuriku 244'. Sensory testing of rice grains with and without LOX-3 confirmed that stale flavor production in LOX-3-null rice during storage was lower than in normal LOX-3 rice. These results indicated that rice varieties with little stale flavor after long storage and preharvest sprouting resistance had been selected.
25922485	The role of nodes in arsenic storage and distribution in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Knowledge of arsenic (As) accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is important for minimizing As transfer to the food chain. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of rice nodes in As storage and distribution. Synchrotron μX-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) was used to map As distribution in the top node and internode of a lsi2 mutant defective in silicon/arsenite efflux carrier and its wild-type (WT) grown in soil. Lsi2 expression in different tissues during grain filling was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Arsenite or dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was supplied to excised panicles to investigate the roles of Lsi2 and phytochelatins (PC) in As distribution. μ-XRF mapping revealed As storage in the phloem of different vascular bundles in the top node and internode. Soil-grown plants of lsi2 had markedly decreased As accumulation in the phloem compared with the WT. Lsi2 was strongly expressed, not only in the roots but also in the nodes. When excised panicles were exposed to As(III), the lsi2 mutant distributed more As to the node and flag leaf but less As to the grain compared with the WT, while there was no significant difference in DMA distribution. Inhibition of PC synthesis by l-buthionine-sulphoximine decreased As(III) deposition in the top node but increased As accumulation in the grain and flag leaf. The results suggest that rice nodes serve as a filter restricting As(III) distribution to the grain. Furthermore, Lsi2 plays a role in As(III) distribution in rice nodes and phytochelatins are important compounds for As(III) storage in the nodes.
25919452	Proteomic Analysis of Copper-Binding Proteins in Excess Copper-Stressed Roots of Two Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Varieties with Different Cu Tolerances.	2015	PLoS One	To better understand the mechanisms involved in the heavy metal stress response and tolerance in plants, a proteomic approach was used to investigate the differences in Cu-binding protein expression in Cu-tolerant and Cu-sensitive rice varieties. Cu-binding proteins from Cu-treated rice roots were separated using a new IMAC method in which an IDA-sepharose column was applied prior to the Cu-IMAC column to remove metal ions from protein samples. More than 300 protein spots were reproducibly detected in the 2D gel. Thirty-five protein spots exhibited changes greater than 1.5-fold in intensity compared to the control. Twenty-four proteins contained one or more of nine putative metal-binding motifs reported by Smith et al., and 19 proteins (spots) contained one to three of the top six motifs reported by Kung et al. The intensities of seven protein spots were increased in the Cu-tolerant variety B1139 compared to the Cu-sensitive variety B1195 (p<0.05) and six protein spots were markedly up-regulated in B1139, but not detectable in B1195. Four protein spots were significantly up-regulated in B1139, but unchanged in B1195 under Cu stress. In contrast, two protein spots were significantly down-regulated in B1195, but unchanged in B1139. These Cu-responsive proteins included those involved in antioxidant defense and detoxification (spots 5, 16, 21, 22, 28, 29 and 33), pathogenesis (spots 5, 16, 21, 22, 28, 29 and 33), regulation of gene transcription (spots 8 and 34), amino acid synthesis (spots 8 and 34), protein synthesis, modification, transport and degradation (spots 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, 19, 30, 31, 32 and 35), cell wall synthesis (spot 14), molecular signaling (spot 3), and salt stress (spots 7, 9 and 27); together with other proteins, such as a putative glyoxylate induced protein, proteins containing dimeric alpha-beta barrel domains, and adenosine kinase-like proteins. Our results suggest that these proteins, together with related physiological processes, play an important role in the detoxification of excess Cu and in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
25865409	Opportunities of marker-assisted selection for rice fragrance through marker-trait association analysis of microsatellites and gene-based markers.	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Developing fragrant rice through marker-assisted/aided selection (MAS) is an economical and profitable approach worldwide for the enrichment of an elite genetic background with a pleasant aroma. The PCR-based DNA markers that distinguish the alleles of major fragrance genes in rice have been synthesised to develop rice scent biofortification through MAS. Thus, the present study examined the aroma biofortification potential of these co-dominant markers in a germplasm panel of 189 F2 progeny developed from crosses between a non-aromatic variety (MR84) and a highly aromatic but low-yielding variety (MRQ74) to determine the most influential diagnostic markers for fragrance biofortification. The SSRs and functional DNA markers RM5633 (on chromosome 4), RM515, RM223, L06, NKSbad2, FMbadh2-E7, BADEX7-5, Aro7 and SCU015RM (on chromosome 8) were highly associated with the 2AP (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline) content across the population. The alleles traced via these markers were also in high linkage disequilibrium (R(2) > 0.70) and explained approximately 12.1, 27.05, 27.05, 27.05, 25.42, 25.42, 20.53, 20.43 and 20.18% of the total phenotypic variation observed for these biomarkers, respectively. F2 plants harbouring the favourable alleles of these effective markers produced higher levels of fragrance. Hence, these rice plants can be used as donor parents to increase the development of fragrance-biofortified tropical rice varieties adapted to growing conditions and consumer preferences, thus contributing to the global rice market.
25650041	Mechanisms of growth and patterns of gene expression in oxygen-deprived rice coleoptiles.	2015	Plant J	Coleoptiles of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings grown under water commonly elongate by up to 1 mm h(-1) to reach the atmosphere. We initially analysed this highly specialized phenomenon by measuring epidermal cell lengths along the coleoptile axis to determine elongation rates. This revealed a cohort of cells in the basal zone that elongated rapidly following emergence from the embryo, reaching 200 μm within 12 h. After filming coleoptiles in vivo for a day, kinematic analysis was applied. Eight time-sliced 'segments' were defined by their emergence from the embryo at four-hourly intervals, revealing a mathematically simple growth model. Each segment entering the coleoptile from the embryo elongated at a constant velocity, resulting in accelerating growth for the entire organ. Consistent with the epidermal cell lengths, relative rates of elongation (mm mm(-1) h(-1)) were tenfold greater in the small, newly emerged basal segments than the older distal tip segments. This steep axial gradient defined two contrasting growth zones (bases versus tips) in which we measured ATP production and protein, RNA and DNA content, and analysed the global transcriptome under steady-state normoxia, hypoxia (3% O2) and anoxia. Determination of the transcriptome revealed tip-specific induction of genes encoding TCP [Teosinte Branched1 (Tb1) of maize, Cycloidea (Cyc), and Proliferating Cell Factor (Pcf)] transcription factors, RNA helicases, ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in protein folding, whilst expression of F-box domain-containing proteins in the ubiquitin E3-SCF complex (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing complex) was induced specifically in bases under low oxygen conditions. We ascribed the sustained elongation under hypoxia to hypoxia-specific responses such as controlled suppression of photosystem components and induction of RNA binding/splicing functions, indicating preferential allocation of energy to cell extension.
25923431	Ozone-Induced Rice Grain Yield Loss Is Triggered via a Change in Panicle Morphology That Is Controlled by ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 Gene.	2015	PLoS One	Rice grain yield is predicted to decrease in the future because of an increase in tropospheric ozone concentration. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the responses to ozone of two rice (Oryza Sativa L.) cultivars, Sasanishiki and Habataki. Sasanishiki showed ozone-induced leaf injury, but no grain yield loss. By contrast, Habataki showed grain yield loss with minimal leaf injury. A QTL associated with grain yield loss caused by ozone was identified in Sasanishiki/Habataki chromosome segment substitution lines and included the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1) gene. The Habataki allele of the APO1 locus in a near-isogenic line also resulted in grain yield loss upon ozone exposure, suggesting APO1 involvement in ozone-induced yield loss. Only a few differences in the APO1 amino acid sequences were detected between the cultivars, but the APO1 transcript level was oppositely regulated by ozone exposure: i.e., it increased in Sasanishiki and decreased in Habataki. Interestingly, the levels of some phytohormones (jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, and abscisic acid) known to be involved in attenuation of ozone-induced leaf injury tended to decrease in Sasanishiki but to increase in Habataki upon ozone exposure. These data indicate that ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki is caused by a reduction in the APO1 transcript level through an increase in the levels of phytohormones that reduce leaf damage.
25920996	A single-repeat MYB transcription repressor, MYBH, participates in regulation of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Leaf senescence, the final stage of leaf development, is regulated tightly by endogenous and environmental signals. MYBS3, a MYB transcription factor with a single DNA-binding domain, mediates sugar signaling in rice. Here we report that an Arabidopsis MYBS3 homolog, MYBH, plays a critical role in developmentally regulated and dark-induced leaf senescence by repressing transcription. Expression of MYBH was enhanced in older and dark-treated leaves. Gain- and loss-of-function analysis indicated that MYBH was involved in the onset of leaf senescence. Plants constitutively overexpressing MYBH underwent premature leaf senescence and showed enhanced expression of leaf senescence marker genes. In contrast, the MYBH mutant line, mybh-1, exhibited a delayed-senescence phenotype. The EAR repression domain was required for MYBH-regulated leaf senescence. Overexpression and knockout of MYBH repressed and enhanced auxin-responsive gene expression, respectively. MYBH repressed the auxin-amido synthase genes DFL1/GH3.6 and DFL2/GH3.10, which regulate auxin homoeostasis, by binding directly to the TA box in each of their regulatory regions. An auxin-responsive phenotype was enhanced in MYBH overexpression lines and reduced in mybh knockout lines. Overexpression of MYBH enhanced gene expression of SAUR36, an auxin-promoted leaf senescence key regulator, and accelerated ABA- and ethylene-induced leaf senescence in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Our results suggest that the role of MYBH in controlling auxin homeostasis accounts for its capacity to participate in regulation of age- and darkness-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.
25923523	CLUSTERED PRIMARY BRANCH 1, a new allele of DWARF11, controls panicle architecture and seed size in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Panicle architecture and seed size are important agronomic traits that directly determine grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Although a number of key genes controlling panicle architecture and seed size have been cloned and characterized in recent years, their genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified a mutant that produced panicles with fascicled primary branching and reduced seeds in size. We isolated the underlying CLUSTERED PRIMARY BRANCH 1 (CPB1) gene, a new allele of DWARF11 (D11) encoding a cytochrome P450 protein involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis pathway. Genetic transformation experiments confirmed that a His360Leu amino acid substitution residing in the highly conserved region of CPB1/D11 was responsible for the panicle architecture and seed size changes in the cpb1 mutants. Overexpression of CPB1/D11 under the background of cpb1 mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls. Furthermore, the CPB1/D11 transgenic plants driven by panicle-specific promoters can enlarge seed size and enhance grain yield without affecting other favourable agronomic traits. These results demonstrated that the specific mutation in CPB1/D11 influenced development of panicle architecture and seed size, and manipulation of CPB1/D11 expression using the panicle-specific promoter could be used to increase seed size, leading to grain yield improvement in rice.
25839331	Evaluation of Glucose Dehydrogenase and Pyrroloquinoline Quinine (pqq) Mutagenesis that Renders Functional Inadequacies in Host Plants.	2015	J Microbiol Biotechnol	The rhizospheric zone abutting plant roots usually clutches a wealth of microbes. In the recent past, enormous genetic resources have been excavated with potential applications in host plant interaction and ancillary aspects. Two Pseudomonas strains were isolated and identified through 16S rRNA and rpoD sequence analyses as P. fluorescens QAU67 and P. putida QAU90. Initial biochemical characterization and their root-colonizing traits indicated their potential role in plant growth promotion. Such aerobic systems, involved in gluconic acid production and phosphate solubilization, essentially require the pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ)- dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in the genome. The PCR screening and amplification of GDH and PQQ and subsequent induction of mutagenesis characterized their possible role as antioxidants as well as in growth promotion, as probed in vitro in lettuce and in vivo in rice, bean, and tomato plants. The results showed significant differences (p < or = 0.05) in parameters of plant height, fresh weight, and dry weight, etc., deciphering a clear and in fact complementary role of GDH and PQQ in plant growth promotion. Our study not only provides direct evidence of the in vivo role of GDH and PQQ in host plants but also reveals their functional inadequacy in the event of mutation at either of these loci.
25884499	Aquaporins in developing rice grains.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	During rice grain filling, grain moisture content and weight show dynamic changes. We focused on the expression of all 33 rice aquaporins in developing grains. Only two aquaporin genes, OsPIP2;1 and OsTIP3;1, were highly expressed in the period 10-25 days after heading (DAH). High-temperature treatment from 7 to 21 DAH abolished the dynamic up-regulation of OsPIP2;1 in the period 15-20 DAH, whereas OsTIP3;1 expression was not affected. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that OsPIP2;1 was present in the starchy endosperm, nucellar projection, nucellar epidermis, and dorsal vascular bundles, but not in the aleurone layer. OsTIP3;1 was present in the aleurone layer and starchy endosperm. Water transport activity of recombinant OsTIP3;1 was low, in contrast to the high activity of recombinant OsPIP2;1 we reported previously. Our data suggest that OsPIP2;1 and OsTIP3;1 have distinct roles in developing grains.
25863133	PlantMirnaT: miRNA and mRNA integrated analysis fully utilizing characteristics of plant sequencing data.	2015	Methods	miRNA is known to regulate up to several hundreds coding genes, thus the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression data is an important problem. Unfortunately, the integrated analysis is challenging since it needs to consider expression data of two different types, miRNA and mRNA, and target relationship between miRNA and mRNA is not clear, especially when microarray data is used. Fortunately, due to the low sequencing cost, small RNA and RNA sequencing are routinely processed and we may be able to infer regulation relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs more accurately by using sequencing data. However, no method is developed specifically for sequencing data. Thus we developed PlantMirnaT, a new miRNA-mRNA integrated analysis system. To fully leverage the power of sequencing data, three major features are developed and implemented in PlantMirnaT. First, we implemented a plant-specific short read mapping tool based on recent discoveries on miRNA target relationship in plant. Second, we designed and implemented an algorithm considering miRNA targets in the full intragenic region, not just 3' UTR. Lastly but most importantly, our algorithm is designed to consider quantity of miRNA expression and its distribution on target mRNAs. The new algorithm was used to characterize rice under drought condition using our proprietary data. Our algorithm successfully discovered that two miRNAs, miRNA1425-5p, miRNA 398b, that are involved in suppression of glucose pathway in a naturally drought resistant rice, Vandana.

25895682	Identifying and confirming quantitative trait loci associated with heat tolerance at flowering stage in different rice populations.	2015	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Climate change is affecting rice production in many countries. Developing new rice varieties with heat tolerance is an essential way to sustain rice production in future global warming. We have previously reported four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for rice spikelet fertility under high temperature at flowering stage from an IR64/N22 population. To further explore additional QTL from other varieties, two bi-parental F2 populations and one three-way F2 population derived from heat tolerant variety Giza178 were used for indentifying and confirming QTLs for heat tolerance at flowering stage.

RESULTS: Four QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF2.1, qHTSF3.1 and qHTSF4.1) were identified in the IR64/Giza178 population, and two other QTLs (qHTSF6.1 and qHTSF11.2) were identified in the Milyang23/Giza178 population. To confirm the identified QTLs, another three-way-cross population derived from IR64//Milyang23/Giza178 was genotyped using 6K SNP chips. Five QTLs were identified in the three-way-cross population, and three of those QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF4.1 and qHTSF6.1) were overlapped with the QTLs identified in the bi-parental populations. The tolerance alleles of these QTLs were from the tolerant parent Giza178 except for qHTSF3.1. The QTL on chromosome 4 (qHTSF4.1) is the same QTL previously identified in the IR64/N22 population.

CONCLUSION: The results from different populations suggest that heat tolerance in rice at flowering stage is controlled by several QTLs with small effects and stronger heat tolerance could be attained through pyramiding validated heat tolerance QTLs. QTL qHTSF4.1 was consistently detected across different genetic backgrounds and could be an important source for enhancing heat tolerance in rice at flowering stage. Polymorphic SNP markers in these QTL regions can be used for future fine mapping and developing SNP chips for marker-assisted breeding.
25904926	Transposons play an important role in the evolution and diversification of centromeres among closely related species.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Centromeres are important chromosomal regions necessary for eukaryotic cell segregation and replication. Due to high amounts of tandem repeats and transposons, centromeres have been difficult to sequence in most multicellular organisms, thus their sequence structure and evolution are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed transposons in the centromere 8 (Cen8) from the African cultivated rice (O. glaberrima) and two subspecies of the Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), indica and japonica. We detected much higher transposon contents (>69%) in centromere regions than in the whole genomes of O. sativa ssp. japonica and O. glaberrima (~35%). We compared the three Cen8s and identified numerous recent insertions of transposons that were frequently organized into multiple-layer nested blocks, similar to nested transposons in maize. Except for the Hopi retrotransposon, all LTR retrotransposons were shared but exhibit different abundances amongst the three Cen8s. Even though a majority of the transposons were located in intergenic regions, some gene-related transposons were found and may be involved in gene diversification. Chromatin immunoprecipitated (ChIP) data analysis revealed that 165 families from both Class I and Class II transposons were found in CENH3-associated chromatin sequences. These results indicate essential roles for transposons in centromeres and that the rapid divergence of the Cen8 sequences between the two cultivated rice species was primarily caused by recent transposon insertions.
25926037	Molecular characterization and application of a novel cytoplasmic male sterility-associated mitochondrial sequence in rice.	2015	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited inability to produce functional pollen found in numerous flowering plant species. CMS is associated with mitochondrial DNA mutation, novel chimeric open reading frames (ORFs), and rearrangement of coding and noncoding regions of the mitochondrial genome.

RESULTS: BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis indicated that L-sp1, a new sequence-characterized amplified region, is non-homologous to atp6-orfH79 (or atp6-orf79) and WA352 cloned CMS-associated genes. L-sp1 was found in 11 of 102 wild rice accessions belonging to four AA genome species: Oryza rufipogon, Oryza nivara, Oryza glumaepatula, and Oryza meridionalis. Using L-sp1, two new CMS lines were developed, from either low natural fertility plants or sterile plants, by backcrossing BC1F1 with Yuetai B. Northern blot and RT-PCR revealed that L-sp1 was only expressed in the anthers of w1/YTB, w2/YTB, w1/YTB//YTB, and w2/YTB//YTB when in the same cytoplasm background.

CONCLUSIONS: L-sp1 is a single-copy chimeric CMS-associated gene found in the mitochondrial genome. It can be expressed in anthers with the same specific cytoplasm background, and will be a useful molecular marker for the development and marker-assisted selection of new CMS lines.
25862679	Multiple cold resistance loci confer the high cold tolerance adaptation of Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) to its high-latitude habitat.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Dongxiang wild rice is phylogenetically close to temperate japonica and contains multiple cold resistance loci conferring its adaptation to high-latitude habitat. Understanding the nature of adaptation in wild populations will benefit crop breeding in the development of climate-resilient crop varieties. Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR), the northernmost common wild rice known, possesses a high degree of cold tolerance and can survive overwintering in its native habitat. However, to date, it is still unclear how DXWR evolved to cope with low-temperature environment, resulting in limited application of DXWR in rice breeding programs. In this study, we carried out both QTL mapping and phylogenetic analysis to discern the genetic mechanism underlying the strong cold resistance. Through a combination of interval mapping and single locus analysis in two genetic populations, at least 13 QTLs for seedling cold tolerance were identified in DXWR. A phylogenetic study using both genome-wide InDel markers and markers associated with cold tolerance loci reveals that DXWR belongs to the Or-III group, which is most closely related to cold-tolerant Japonica rice rather than to the Indica cultivars that are predominant in the habitat where DXWR grows. Our study paves the way toward an understanding of the nature of adaptation to a northern habitat in O. rufipogon. The QTLs identified in DXWR in this study will be useful for molecular breeding of cold-tolerant rice.
25923314	Rapid responses of mesophyll conductance to changes of CO2 concentration, temperature and irradiance are affected by N supplements in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Photosynthesis in C3 plants is significantly limited by mesophyll conductance (gm ), which can vary with leaf anatomical traits and nitrogen (N) supplements. Several studies have investigated the response of gm to N supplements; however, none examined the implications of N supplements on the response of gm to rapid environmental changes. Here we investigated the effect of N supplement on gm and the response of gm to change of CO2 , temperature and irradiance in rice. High N supplement (HN) increased mesophyll cell wall surface area and chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular airspace per leaf area, and reduced cell wall thickness. These changes resulted in increased gm . The gm of leaves with HN was more sensitive to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature and irradiance. The difference in leaf structural features between low N supplement and HN indicates that a rapid change in gm is related to the regulation of diffusion through biological membranes rather than leaf structural features. These results will contribute to an understanding of the determinants of gm response to rapid changes in environmental factors.
25907026	The effects of recombination, mutation and selection on the evolution of the Rp1 resistance genes in grasses.	2015	Mol Ecol	Plant immune genes, or resistance genes, are involved in a co-evolutionary arms race with a diverse range of pathogens. In agronomically important grasses, such R genes have been extensively studied because of their role in pathogen resistance and in the breeding of resistant cultivars. In this study, we evaluate the importance of recombination, mutation and selection on the evolution of the R gene complex Rp1 of Sorghum, Triticum, Brachypodium, Oryza and Zea. Analyses show that recombination is widespread, and we detected 73 independent instances of sequence exchange, involving on average 1567 of 4692 nucleotides analysed (33.4%). We were able to date 24 interspecific recombination events and found that four occurred postspeciation, which suggests that genetic introgression took place between different grass species. Other interspecific events seemed to have been maintained over long evolutionary time, suggesting the presence of balancing selection. Significant positive selection (i.e. a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN /dS >1)) was detected in 17-95 codons (0.42-2.02%). Recombination was significantly associated with areas with high levels of polymorphism but not with an elevated dN /dS ratio. Finally, phylogenetic analyses show that recombination results in a general overestimation of the divergence time (mean = 14.3%) and an alteration of the gene tree topology if the tree is not calibrated. Given that the statistical power to detect recombination is determined by the level of polymorphism of the amplicon as well as the number of sequences analysed, it is likely that many studies have underestimated the importance of recombination relative to the mutation rate.

25901158	Evaluation of Emerging Fusarium mycotoxins beauvericin, Enniatins, Fusaproliferin and Moniliformin in Domestic Rice in Iran.	2015	Iran J Pharm Res	The occurrence of emerging Fusarium mycotoxins beauvericin (BEA), enniatins (ENNs) (A, A1, B, B1), Fusaproliferin and moniliformin was evaluated by a liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric (LC/ESI-MS/MS) technique in 65 domestic rice samples produced in Gilan and Mazandaran Provinces in Iran. The results showed that 46% of the samples were contaminated with at least one of the emerging mycotoxins. BEA was the most prevalent mycotoxin, which was found in 26 out of 65 rice samples at the concentrations up to 0.47 µg/Kg. Enniatin A1 which was the only member of ENNs was detected in the samples, occurred in 7.7% of samples with an average level of 0.06 μg/Kg. No detectable level of Fusaproliferin and moniliformin was found. This is the ﬁrst report concerning the contamination of Iranian domestic rice samples with the emerging Fusarium mycotoxins.
25837042	Global genome and transcriptome analyses of Magnaporthe oryzae epidemic isolate 98-06 uncover novel effectors and pathogenicity-related genes, revealing gene gain and lose dynamics in genome evolution.	2015	PLoS Pathog	Genome dynamics of pathogenic organisms are driven by pathogen and host co-evolution, in which pathogen genomes are shaped to overcome stresses imposed by hosts with various genetic backgrounds through generation of a variety of isolates. This same principle applies to the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the rice host; however, genetic variations among different isolates of M. oryzae remain largely unknown, particularly at genome and transcriptome levels. Here, we applied genomic and transcriptomic analytical tools to investigate M. oryzae isolate 98-06 that is the most aggressive in infection of susceptible rice cultivars. A unique 1.4 Mb of genomic sequences was found in isolate 98-06 in comparison to reference strain 70-15. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed the presence of two critical expression patterns of M. oryzae based on 64 known pathogenicity-related (PaR) genes. In addition, 134 candidate effectors with various segregation patterns were identified. Five tested proteins could suppress BAX-mediated programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Characterization of isolate-specific effector candidates Iug6 and Iug9 and PaR candidate Iug18 revealed that they have a role in fungal propagation and pathogenicity. Moreover, Iug6 and Iug9 are located exclusively in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and their overexpression leads to suppression of defense-related gene expression in rice, suggesting that they might participate in biotrophy by inhibiting the SA and ET pathways within the host. Thus, our studies identify novel effector and PaR proteins involved in pathogenicity of the highly aggressive M. oryzae field isolate 98-06, and reveal molecular and genomic dynamics in the evolution of M. oryzae and rice host interactions.
25857664	Bottlenecks in carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in rice endosperm are influenced by the precursor-product balance.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	The profile of secondary metabolites in plants reflects the balance of biosynthesis, degradation and storage, including the availability of precursors and products that affect the metabolic equilibrium. We investigated the impact of the precursor-product balance on the carotenoid pathway in the endosperm of intact rice plants because this tissue does not normally accumulate carotenoids, allowing us to control each component of the pathway. We generated transgenic plants expressing the maize phytoene synthase gene (ZmPSY1) and the bacterial phytoene desaturase gene (PaCRTI), which are sufficient to produce β-carotene in the presence of endogenous lycopene β-cyclase. We combined this mini-pathway with the Arabidopsis thaliana genes AtDXS (encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, which supplies metabolic precursors) or AtOR (the ORANGE gene, which promotes the formation of a metabolic sink). Analysis of the resulting transgenic plants suggested that the supply of isoprenoid precursors from the MEP pathway is one of the key factors limiting carotenoid accumulation in the endosperm and that the overexpression of AtOR increased the accumulation of carotenoids in part by up-regulating a series of endogenous carotenogenic genes. The identification of metabolic bottlenecks in the pathway will help to refine strategies for the creation of engineered plants with specific carotenoid profiles.
25915023	Overexpressing of OsAMT1-3, a High Affinity Ammonium Transporter Gene, Modifies Rice Growth and Carbon-Nitrogen Metabolic Status.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	AMT1-3 encodes the high affinity NH₄⁺ transporter in rice roots and is predominantly expressed under nitrogen starvation. In order to evaluate the effect of AMT1-3 gene on rice growth, nitrogen absorption and metabolism, we generated AMT1-3-overexpressing plants and analyzed the growth phenotype, yield, carbon and nitrogen metabolic status, and gene expression profiles. Although AMT1-3 mRNA accumulated in transgenic plants, these plants displayed significant decreases in growth when compared to the wild-type plants. The nitrogen uptake assay using a 15N tracer revealed poor nitrogen uptake ability in AMT1-3-overexpressing plants. We found significant decreases in AMT1-3-overexpressing plant leaf carbon and nitrogen content accompanied with a higher leaf C/N ratio. Significant changes in soluble proteins and carbohydrates were also observed in AMT1-3-overexpressing plants. In addition, metabolite profile analysis demonstrated significant changes in individual sugars, organic acids and free amino acids. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of genes that participate in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, the correlation between the metabolites and gene expression patterns was consistent in AMT1-3-overexpressing plants under both low and high nitrogen growth conditions. Therefore, we hypothesized that the carbon and nitrogen metabolic imbalance caused by AMT1-3 overexpressing attributed to the poor growth and yield of transgenic plants.
25859292	The rice ALS3 encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is required for chloroplast development and seedling growth.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play essential roles in modulating the expression of organelle genes and have expanded greatly in higher plants. However, molecular mechanisms of most rice PPR genes remain unclear.

RESULTS: In this study, a new rice PPR mutant, asl3 (albino seedling lethality3) exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage. This albino phenotype was associated with altered photosynthetic-pigment and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning showed that ASL3 encodes a novel rice PPR protein with 10 tandem PPR motifs, which localizes to the chloroplast. ASL3 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in the chlorenchyma, but expressed at much lower levels in roots and panicles. RNAi of ASL3 confirmed that ASL3 plays an essential role in the early development and chloroplast development in rice. Moreover, expression analysis revealed that the asl3 mutation severely affected the transcriptional levels of important genes associated with plastid translation machinery and photosynthesis, which may impair photosynthesis and finally led to the seedling death in asl3 mutant. These results evidenced the important role of ASL3 in the early development of rice, especially chloroplast development.

CONCLUSIONS: The ASL3 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein with 10 tandem PPR motifs in rice. Disruption of the ASL3 would lead to a defective chloroplast and seedling lethality, and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early leaf stage of rice.
25865338	Simulating yield response of rice to salinity stress with the AquaCrop model.	2015	Environ Sci Process Impacts	The FAO AquaCrop model has been widely applied throughout the world to simulate crop responses to deficit water applications. However, its application to saline conditions is not yet reported, though saline soils are common in coastal areas. In this study, we parameterized and tested AquaCrop to simulate rice yield under different salinity regimes. The data and information required in the model were collected through a field experiment at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Gazipur. The experiment was conducted with the BRRI Dhan28, a popular boro rice variety in Bangladesh, with five levels of saline water irrigation, three replicates for each level. In addition, field monitoring was carried out at Satkhira in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh to collect data and information based on farmers' practices and to further validate the model. The results indicated that the AquaCrop model with most of its default parameters could replicate the variation of rice yield with the variation of salinity reasonably well. The root mean square error and mean absolute error of the model yield were only 0.12 t per ha and 0.03 t per ha, respectively. The crop response versus soil salinity stress curve was found to be convex in shape with a lower threshold of 2 dS m(-1), an upper threshold of 10 dS m(-1) and a shape factor of 2.4. As the crop production system in the coastal belt of Bangladesh has become vulnerable to climate induced sea-level rise and the consequent increase in water and soil salinity, the AquaCrop would be a useful tool in assessing the potential impact of these future changes as well as other climatic parameters on rice yield in the coastal region.
25917172	A Robust CRISPR/Cas9 System for Convenient, High-Efficiency Multiplex Genome Editing in Monocot and Dicot Plants.	2015	Mol Plant	CRISPR/Cas9 genome targeting systems have been applied to a variety of species. However, most CRISPR/Cas9 systems reported for plants can only modify one or a few target sites. Here, we report a robust CRISPR/Cas9 vector system, utilizing a plant codon optimized Cas9 gene, for convenient and high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in monocot and dicot plants. We designed PCR-based procedures to rapidly generate multiple sgRNA expression cassettes, which can be assembled into the binary CRISPR/Cas9 vectors in one round of cloning by Golden Gate ligation or Gibson Assembly. With this system, we edited 46 target sites in rice with an average 85.4% rate of mutation, mostly in biallelic and homozygous status. We reasoned that about 16% of the homozygous mutations in rice were generated through the non-homologous end-joining mechanism followed by homologous recombination-based repair. We also obtained uniform biallelic, heterozygous, homozygous, and chimeric mutations in Arabidopsis T1 plants. The targeted mutations in both rice and Arabidopsis were heritable. We provide examples of loss-of-function gene mutations in T0 rice and T1 Arabidopsis plants by simultaneous targeting of multiple (up to eight) members of a gene family, multiple genes in a biosynthetic pathway, or multiple sites in a single gene. This system has provided a versatile toolbox for studying functions of multiple genes and gene families in plants for basic research and genetic improvement.
25954282	Comprehensive analysis of transcriptome response to salinity stress in the halophytic turf grass Sporobolus virginicus.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The turf grass Sporobolus virginicus is halophyte and has high salinity tolerance. To investigate the molecular basis of its remarkable tolerance, we performed Illumina high-throughput RNA sequencing on roots and shoots of a S. virginicus genotype under normal and saline conditions. The 130 million short reads were assembled into 444,242 unigenes. A comparative analysis of the transcriptome with rice and Arabidopsis transcriptome revealed six turf grass-specific unigenes encoding transcription factors. Interestingly, all of them showed root specific expression and five of them encode bZIP type transcription factors. Another remarkable transcriptional feature of S. virginicus was activation of specific pathways under salinity stress. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested transcriptional activation of amino acid, pyruvate, and phospholipid metabolism. Up-regulation of several unigenes, previously shown to respond to salt stress in other halophytes was also observed. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that unigenes assigned as proteins in response to water stress, such as dehydrin and aquaporin, and transporters such as cation, amino acid, and citrate transporters, and H(+)-ATPase, were up-regulated in both shoots and roots under salinity. A correspondence analysis of the enriched pathways in turf grass cells, but not in rice cells, revealed two groups of unigenes similarly up-regulated in the turf grass in response to salt stress; one of the groups, showing excessive up-regulation under salinity, included unigenes homologos to salinity responsive genes in other halophytes. Thus, the present study identified candidate genes involved in salt tolerance of S. virginicus. This genetic resource should be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying high salt tolerance in S. virginicus. This information can also provide insight into salt tolerance in other halophytes.
25783167	Coordinated regulation of melatonin synthesis and degradation genes in rice leaves in response to cadmium treatment.	2015	J Pineal Res	We investigated the expression patterns of genes involved in melatonin synthesis and degradation in rice leaves upon cadmium (Cd) treatment and the subcellular localization sites of melatonin 2-hydroxylase (M2H) proteins. The Cd-induced synthesis of melatonin coincided with the increased expression of melatonin biosynthetic genes including tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H), and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT). However, the expression of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), the penultimate gene in melatonin biosynthesis, was downregulated, suggesting that melatonin synthesis was counter-regulated by SNAT. Notably, the induction of melatonin biosynthetic gene expression was coupled with the induction of four M2H genes involved in melatonin degradation, which suggests that genes for melatonin synthesis and degradation are coordinately regulated. The induced M2H gene expression was correlated with enhanced M2H enzyme activity. Three of the M2H proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and one M2H protein was localized to chloroplasts, indicating that melatonin degradation occurs both in the cytoplasm and in chloroplasts. The biological activity of 2-hydroxymelatonin in the induction of the plant defense gene expression was 50% less than that of melatonin, which indicates that 2-hydroxymelatonin may be a metabolite of melatonin. Overall, our data demonstrate that melatonin synthesis occurs in parallel with melatonin degradation in both chloroplasts and cytoplasm, and the resulting melatonin metabolite 2-hydroxymelatonin also acts as a signaling molecule for defense gene induction.
25846381	Sequence-tagged high-density genetic maps of Zoysia japonica provide insights into genome evolution in Chloridoideae.	2015	Plant J	Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.), belonging to the genus Zoysia in the subfamily Chloridoideae, is widely used in domestic lawns, sports fields and as forage. We constructed high-density genetic maps of Zoysia japonica using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach and an F1 mapping population derived from a cross between 'Carrizo' and 'El Toro'. Two linkage maps were constructed, one for each of the parents. A map consisting of 2408 RAD markers distributed on 21 linkage groups was constructed for 'Carrizo'. Another map with 1230 RAD markers mapped on 20 linkage groups was constructed for 'El Toro'. The average distance between adjacent markers of the two maps was at 0.56 and 1.4 cM, respectively. Comparative genomics analysis was carried out among zoysiagrass, rice and sorghum genomes and a highly conserved collinearity in the gene order was observed among the three genomes. Chromosome collinearity was disrupted at centromeric regions for each chromosome pair between zoysiagrass and sorghum genomes. However, no obvious synteny gaps were observed across the centromeric regions between zoysiagrass and rice genomes. Two homologous chromosomes for each of the 10 sorghum chromosomes were found in the zoysiagrass genome, indicating an allotetraploid origin for zoysiagrass. The reduction of the basic chromosome number from 12 to 10 in chloridoids and panicoids took place via independent single-step nested chromosome fusion events after the two subfamilies diverged from a common ancestor. The genetic maps will assist in genome sequence assembly, targeted gene isolation and comparative genomic analyses among grasses.
25843222	Current advance methods for the identification of blast resistance genes in rice.	2015	C R Biol	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating diseases of rice around the world and crop losses due to blast are considerably high. Many blast resistant rice varieties have been developed by classical plant breeding and adopted by farmers in various rice-growing countries. However, the variability in the pathogenicity of the blast fungus according to environment made blast disease a major concern for farmers, which remains a threat to the rice industry. With the utilization of molecular techniques, plant breeders have improved rice production systems and minimized yield losses. In this article, we have summarized the current advanced molecular techniques used for controlling blast disease. With the advent of new technologies like marker-assisted selection, molecular mapping, map-based cloning, marker-assisted backcrossing and allele mining, breeders have identified more than 100 Pi loci and 350 QTL in rice genome responsible for blast disease. These Pi genes and QTLs can be introgressed into a blast-susceptible cultivar through marker-assisted backcross breeding. These molecular techniques provide timesaving, environment friendly and labour-cost-saving ways to control blast disease. The knowledge of host-plant interactions in the frame of blast disease will lead to develop resistant varieties in the future.
25902056	Genome-Wide Distribution, Organisation and Functional Characterization of Disease Resistance and Defence Response Genes across Rice Species.	2015	PLoS One	The resistance (R) genes and defense response (DR) genes have become very important resources for the development of disease resistant cultivars. In the present investigation, genome-wide identification, expression, phylogenetic and synteny analysis was done for R and DR-genes across three species of rice viz: Oryza sativa ssp indica cv 93-11, Oryza sativa ssp japonica and wild rice species, Oryza brachyantha. We used the in silico approach to identify and map 786 R -genes and 167 DR-genes, 672 R-genes and 142 DR-genes, 251 R-genes and 86 DR-genes in the japonica, indica and O. brachyanth a genomes, respectively. Our analysis showed that 60.5% and 55.6% of the R-genes are tandemly repeated within clusters and distributed over all the rice chromosomes in indica and japonica genomes, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis along with motif distribution shows high degree of conservation of R- and DR-genes in clusters. In silico expression analysis of R-genes and DR-genes showed more than 85% were expressed genes showing corresponding EST matches in the databases. This study gave special emphasis on mechanisms of gene evolution and duplication for R and DR genes across species. Analysis of paralogs across rice species indicated 17% and 4.38% R-genes, 29% and 11.63% DR-genes duplication in indica and Oryza brachyantha, as compared to 20% and 26% duplication of R-genes and DR-genes in japonica respectively. We found that during the course of duplication only 9.5% of R- and DR-genes changed their function and rest of the genes have maintained their identity. Syntenic relationship across three genomes inferred that more orthology is shared between indica and japonica genomes as compared to brachyantha genome. Genome wide identification of R-genes and DR-genes in the rice genome will help in allele mining and functional validation of these genes, and to understand molecular mechanism of disease resistance and their evolution in rice and related species.
25875607	Effects of delaying transplanting on agronomic traits and grain yield of rice under mechanical transplantation pattern.	2015	PLoS One	A delay in the mechanical transplantation (MT) of rice seedlings frequently occurs in Huanghuai wheat-rice rotation cropping districts of China, due to the late harvest of wheat, the poor weather conditions and the insufficiency of transplanters, missing the optimum transplanting time and causing seedlings to age. To identify how delaying transplanting rice affects the agronomic characteristics including the growth duration, photosynthetic productivity and dry matter remobilization efficiency and the grain yield under mechanical transplanting pattern, an experiment with a split-plot design was conducted over two consecutive years. The main plot includes two types of cultivation: mechanical transplanting and artificial transplanting (AT). The subplot comprises four japonica rice cultivars. The results indicate that the rice jointing, booting, heading and maturity stages were postponed under MT when using AT as a control. The tiller occurrence number, dry matter weight per tiller, accumulative dry matter for the population, leaf area index, crop growth rate, photosynthetic potential, and dry matter remobilization efficiency of the leaf under MT significantly decreased compared to those under AT. In contrast, the reduction rate of the leaf area during the heading-maturity stage was markedly enhanced under MT. The numbers of effective panicles and filled grains per panicle and the grain yield significantly decreased under MT. A significant correlation was observed between the dry matter production, remobilization and distribution characteristics and the grain yield. We infer that, as with rice from old seedlings, the decrease in the tiller occurrence, the photosynthetic productivity and the assimilate remobilization efficiency may be important agronomic traits that are responsible for the reduced grain yield under MT.
25896918	Genetic analysis of inflorescence and plant height components in sorghum (Panicoidae) and comparative genetics with rice (Oryzoidae).	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Domestication has played an important role in shaping characteristics of the inflorescence and plant height in cultivated cereals. Taking advantage of meta-analysis of QTLs, phylogenetic analyses in 502 diverse sorghum accessions, GWAS in a sorghum association panel (n = 354) and comparative data, we provide insight into the genetic basis of the domestication traits in sorghum and rice.

RESULTS: We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 6 traits related to inflorescence morphology and 6 traits related to plant height in sorghum, comparing the genomic regions implicated in these traits by GWAS and QTL mapping, respectively. In a search for signatures of selection, we identify genomic regions that may contribute to sorghum domestication regarding plant height, flowering time and pericarp color. Comparative studies across taxa show functionally conserved 'hotspots' in sorghum and rice for awn presence and pericarp color that do not appear to reflect corresponding single genes but may indicate co-regulated clusters of genes. We also reveal homoeologous regions retaining similar functions for plant height and flowering time since genome duplication an estimated 70 million years ago or more in a common ancestor of cereals. In most such homoeologous QTL pairs, only one QTL interval exhibits strong selection signals in modern sorghum.

CONCLUSIONS: Intersections among QTL, GWAS and comparative data advance knowledge of genetic determinants of inflorescence and plant height components in sorghum, and add new dimensions to comparisons between sorghum and rice.
25910688	Reducing arsenic accumulation in rice grain through iron oxide amendment.	2015	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Effects of soil-arsenic (As), phosphorus and iron oxide on As accumulation in rice grain were investigated. Cultivars that have significantly different sensitivity to As, straighthead-resistant Zhe 733 and straighthead-susceptible Cocodrie, were used to represent different cultivar varieties. The grain accumulation of other elements of concern, selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd) was also monitored. Results demonstrated that high soil-As not only resulted in high grain-As, but could also result in high grain-Se, and Zhe 733 had significantly less grain-As than Cocodrie did. However, soil-As did not impact grain-Mo and Cd. Among all elements monitored, iron oxide amendment significantly reduced grain-As for both cultivars, while the phosphate application only reduced grain-Se for Zhe 733. Results also indicated that cultivar type significantly impacted grain accumulation of all monitored trace elements. Therefore, applying iron oxide to As-contaminated land, in addition to choosing appropriate rice cultivar, can effectively reduce the grain accumulation of As.
25923345	Whole genome sequencing of elite rice cultivars as a comprehensive information resource for marker assisted selection.	2015	PLoS One	Current advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics revealed the genomic background of rice, a staple food for the poor people, and provided the basis to develop large genomic variation databases for thousands of cultivars. Proper analysis of this massive resource is expected to give novel insights into the structure, function, and evolution of the rice genome, and to aid the development of rice varieties through marker assisted selection or genomic selection. In this work we present sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of 104 rice varieties belonging to the major subspecies of Oryza sativa. We identified repetitive elements and recurrent copy number variation covering about 200 Mbp of the rice genome. Genotyping of over 18 million polymorphic locations within O. sativa allowed us to reconstruct the individual haplotype patterns shaping the genomic background of elite varieties used by farmers throughout the Americas. Based on a reconstruction of the alleles for the gene GBSSI, we could identify novel genetic markers for selection of varieties with high amylose content. We expect that both the analysis methods and the genomic information described here would be of great use for the rice research community and for other groups carrying on similar sequencing efforts in other crops.
25842038	Assessment of epiphytic yeast diversity in rice (Oryza sativa) phyllosphere in Thailand by a culture-independent approach.	2015	Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek	The epiphytic yeast diversity in rice phyllosphere in Thailand was investigated by a culture-independent technique based on the RFLP pattern and the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene. Forty-four samples of rice leaf were collected randomly from six provinces. The DNA was extracted from leaf washing samples and the D1/D2 domain was amplified using PCR technique. The PCR products were cloned and then screened by colony PCR. Of total 1121 clones, 451 clones (40.2 %) revealed the D1/D2 domain sequences closely related to sequences of yeasts in GenBank, and they were clustered into 45 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 99 % homology. Of total yeast related clones, 329 clones (72.9 %) were identified as nine known yeast species, which consisted of 314 clones (8 OTUs) in the phylum Basidiomycota including Bullera japonica, Pseudozyma antarctica, Pseudozyma aphidis, Sporobolomyces blumeae, Sporobolomyces carnicolor and Sporobolomyces oryzicola and 15 clones (6 OTUs) in the phylum Ascomycota including Metschnikowia koreensis, Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. The D1/D2 sequences (122 clones) that could not be identified as known yeast species were closest to 3 and 14 species in Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively, some of which may be new yeast species. The most predominant species detected was P. antarctica (42.6 %) followed by B. japonica (25.9 %) with 63.6 and 22.7 % frequency of occurrence, respectively. The results of OTU richness of each sampling location revealed that climate condition and sampling location could affect epiphytic yeast diversity in rice phyllosphere.
25842177	Rapid turnover of antimicrobial-type cysteine-rich protein genes in closely related Oryza genomes.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Defensive and reproductive protein genes undergo rapid evolution. Small, cysteine-rich secreted peptides (CRPs) act as antimicrobial agents and function in plant intercellular signaling and are over-represented among reproductively expressed proteins. Because of their roles in defense, reproduction and development and their presence in multigene families, CRP variation can have major consequences for plant phenotypic and functional diversification. We surveyed the CRP genes of six closely related Oryza genomes comprising Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and ssp. indica, Oryza glaberrima and three accessions of Oryza rufipogon to observe patterns of evolution in these gene families and the effects of variation on their gene expression. These Oryza genomes, like other plant genomes, have accumulated large reservoirs of CRP sequences, comprising 26 groups totaling between 676 and 843 genes, in contrast to antimicrobial CRPs in animal genomes. Despite the close evolutionary relationships between the genomes, we observed rapid changes in number and structure among CRP gene families. Many CRP sequences are in gene clusters generated by local duplications, have undergone rapid turnover and are more likely to be silent or specifically expressed. By contrast, conserved CRP genes are more likely to be highly and broadly expressed. Variable CRP genes created by repeated duplication, gene modification and inactivation can gain new functions and expression patterns in newly evolved gene copies. For the CRP proteins, the process of gain/loss by deletion or duplication at gene clusters seems to be an important mechanism in evolution of the gene families, which also contributes to their expression evolution.
25917758	Interactions of OsMADS1 with Floral Homeotic Genes in Rice Flower Development.	2015	Mol Plant	During reproductive development, rice plants develop unique flower organs which determine the final grain yield. OsMADS1, one of SEPALLATA-like MADS-box genes, has been unraveled to play critical roles in rice floral organ identity specification and floral meristem determinacy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions of OsMADS1 with other floral homeotic genes in regulating flower development remains largely elusive. In this work, we studied the genetic interactions of OsMADS1 with B-, C-, and D-class genes along with physical interactions among their proteins. We show that the physical and genetic interactions between OsMADS1 and OsMADS3 are essential for floral meristem activity maintenance and organ identity specification; while OsMADS1 physically and genetically interacts with OsMADS58 in regulating floral meristem determinacy and suppressing spikelet meristem reversion. We provided important genetic evidence to support the neofunctionalization of two rice C-class genes (OsMADS3 and OsMADS58) during flower development. Gene expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR analyses further revealed that OsMADS1 affects the expression of many genes involved in floral identity and hormone signaling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assay further demonstrated that OsMADS17 is a direct target gene of OsMADS1. Taken together, these results reveal that OsMADS1 has diversified regulatory functions in specifying rice floral organ and meristem identity, probably through its genetic and physical interactions with different floral homeotic regulators.
25912474	Melatonin delays leaf senescence and enhances salt stress tolerance in rice.	2015	J Pineal Res	Melatonin, an antioxidant in both animals and plants, has been reported to have beneficial effects on the aging process. It was also suggested to play a role in extending longevity and enhancing abiotic stress resistance in plant. In this study, we demonstrate that melatonin acts as a potent agent to delay leaf senescence and cell death in rice. Treatments with melatonin significantly reduced chlorophyll degradation, suppressed the transcripts of senescence-associated genes, delayed the leaf senescence, and enhanced salt stress tolerance. Genome-wide expression profiling by RNA sequencing reveals that melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger, and its exogenous application results in enhanced antioxidant protection. Leaf cell death in noe1, a mutant with over-produced H2O2, can be relieved by exogenous application of melatonin. These data demonstrate that melatonin delays the leaf senescence and cell death and also enhances abiotic stress tolerance via directly or indirectly counteracting the cellular accumulation of H2O2.
25901895	Uptake Kinetics of Arsenic in Upland Rice Cultivar Zhonghan 221 Inoculated with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi.	2015	Int J Phytoremediation	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) appear to be highly associated with arsenic (As) uptake in host plants because arsenate (As(V)) and phosphorus (P) share the same transporter, whereby AMF can enhance P uptake. A short-term experiment was conducted for low- (0 to 0.05 mM As) and high-affinity (0 to 2.5 mM As) uptake systems, to investigate the AMF role on As uptake mechanism in plants, which may explain As uptake kinetics in upland rice cultivar: Zhonghan 221. When concentration of As ranged from 0 to 0.05 mM, Funneliformis geosporum (Fg) significantly decreased arsenite (As(III)) and monomethylarsonicacid (MMA) uptake when (p < 0.05) compared to non-mycorrhizal (NM) treatment, since the major route for (As(III)) in rice roots-rice silicon transporter Lsi1 would be influenced by Fg inoculation at high As concentrations. Fg can also reduce As(V) uptake significantly (p < 0.05) under both uptake systems relative to NM treatment, whereas, Funneliformis mosseae (Fm) increased As(V) and MMA uptake in rice roots, with MMA uptake rate generally lower than As(III) and As(V). Using suitable AMF species inoculation with rice, As uptake and accumulation in rice grains can be reduced and the risk to human health, once consumed, can be minimized.
25931193	Genome sequence of Xanthomonas sacchari R1, a biocontrol bacterium isolated from the rice seed.	2015	J Biotechnol	Xanthomonas sacchari, was first identified as a pathogenic bacterium isolated from diseased sugarcane in Guadeloupe. In this study, R1 was first isolated from rice seed samples from Philippines in 2002. The antagonistic ability against several rice pathogens raises our attention. The genomic feature of this strain was described in this paper. The total genome size of X. sacchari R1 is 5,000,479 bp with 4315 coding sequences (CDS), 59 tRNAs, 2rRNAs and one plasmid.
25758958	Optimization of recombinant expression enables discovery of novel cytochrome P450 activity in rice diterpenoid biosynthesis.	2015	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The oxygenation reactions catalyzed by cytochromes P450 (CYPs) play critical roles in plant natural products biosynthesis. At the same time, CYPs are one of most challenging enzymes to functionally characterize due to the difficulty of recombinantly expressing these membrane-associated monooxygenases. In the course of investigating rice diterpenoid biosynthesis, we have developed a synthetic biology approach for functional expression of relevant CYPs in Escherichia coli. In certain cases, activity was observed for only one of two closely related paralogs although it seems clear that related reactions are required for production of the known diterpenoids. Here, we report that optimization of the recombinant expression system enabled characterization of not only these previously recalcitrant CYPs, but also discovery of additional activity relevant to rice diterpenoid biosynthesis. Of particular interest, CYP701A8 was found to catalyze 3β-hydroxylation of syn-pimaradiene, which is presumably relevant to momilactone biosynthesis, while CYP71Z6 & 7 were found to catalyze multiple reactions, with CYP71Z6 catalyzing the production of 2α,3α-dihydroxy-ent-isokaurene via 2α-hydroxy-ent-isokaurene, and CYP71Z7 catalyzing the production of 3α-hydroxy-ent-cassadien-2-one via 2α-hydroxy-ent-cassadiene and ent-cassadien-2-one, which may be relevant to oryzadione and phytocassane biosynthesis, respectively.
25867385	Evaluation of reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in the leaves of rice seedlings under salt stress.	2015	Genet Mol Res	To obtain accurate and reliable results for the expression of genes of interest using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques, it is necessary to normalize the data by comparing them to constitutive genes that exhibit uniform expression levels under experimental conditions. In this study, the stability of expression was evaluated for the following ten candidate reference genes in rice leaves (Oryza sativa L.) from the BRS Bojuru and BRS Ligeirinho genotypes that were subjected to salt stress (150 mM): actin 11 (ACT11), beta-tubulin (β-TUB), eukaryote elongation factor 1-α (Eef-1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4-α (eIF-4-α), E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC-E2), ubiquitin 5 (UBQ5), ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TIP41-like, and cyclophilin. The stability of expression for the aforementioned genes was then compared to that of three LTP genes using UBQ10, Eef-1, and eIF-4-α as references. After analyzing the expression levels using analysis of variance tests, the results indicated that UBQ10 was the most stable in all treatments (M = 0.404 and SV = 0.327). Furthermore, the eIF-4-α, TIP41-like, and cyclophilin genes exhibited the highest total coefficient of variation (CV = 269, 169.2, 179.2, respectively), which signifies that they exhibited the least stable expression. The expression levels of each candidate gene (LTP7, LTP10, and LTP13) were in contrast to the reference genes. Therefore, we concluded that UBQ10 is the best reference gene for RT-qPCR reactions under the experimental conditions. The expression analysis of LTP7, LTP10, and LTP13 confirmed the importance of validating reference genes to achieve accurate RT-qPCR results.
25820664	Growth and development of Colorado potato beetle larvae, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, on potato plants expressing the oryzacystatin II proteinase inhibitor.	2015	Transgenic Res	Plant proteinase inhibitors (PIs) are attractive tools for crop improvement and their heterologous expression can enhance insect resistance in transgenic plants. PI oryzacystatin II (OCII), isolated from rice, showed potential in controlling pests that utilize cysteine proteinases for protein digestion. To evaluate the applicability of the OCII gene in enhancing plant defence, OCII-transformed potatoes were bioassayed for resistance to Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). Feeding on transformed leaves of potato cultivars Desiree and Jelica significantly affected larval growth and development, but did not change mortality rates. During the L2 and L3 developmental stages larvae consumed the OCII-transformed foliage faster as compared to the nontransformed control. Also these larvae reached the prepupal stage (end of L4 stage) 2 days earlier than those fed on control leaves. However, the total amounts of consumed OCII-transformed leaves were up to 23% lower than of control, and the maximal weights of prepupal larvae were reduced by up to 18% as compared to larvae fed on nontransformed leaves. The reduction in insect fitness reported in this study in combination with other control measures, could lead to improved CPB resistance management in potato.
25846878	Characterization and fine mapping of a female fertility associated gene Ff1(t) in rice.	2015	J Genet	Female-sterile line can be used as a pollinator which has a great potential for hybrid seeds production. However, reports on female fertility are fewer than male fertility. Here, we characterized a recessive female fertility weakening mutant ff1(t) from rice. The spikelet fertility was seriously affected in the mutant. Reciprocal crosses and pollen vitality assay suggest that the decreased fertility was caused by the defective female gametophytes. Further investigation indicated that the mutant ovary development was inhibited before fertilization and failed swelling after flowering. Genetic analysis and fine mapping showed that the mutant was controlled by a single recessive gene, residing on a 16.8 kb region on the long arm of chromosome 1. The gene annotation indicated that there was only one putative gene encoding lysine decarboxylase-like protein in this region, which was allelic to LOG. Further, the sequence analysis was carried out and a substitution at the splice site of intron 2 / exon 3 was revealed in ff1(t) mutant, resulting in the change of reading frame. The finding of novel allele of LOG locus will facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of female gametophyte development.
25785447	Genome-wide association mapping for yield and other agronomic traits in an elite breeding population of tropical rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	PLoS One	Genome-wide association mapping studies (GWAS) are frequently used to detect QTL in diverse collections of crop germplasm, based on historic recombination events and linkage disequilibrium across the genome. Generally, diversity panels genotyped with high density SNP panels are utilized in order to assay a wide range of alleles and haplotypes and to monitor recombination breakpoints across the genome. By contrast, GWAS have not generally been performed in breeding populations. In this study we performed association mapping for 19 agronomic traits including yield and yield components in a breeding population of elite irrigated tropical rice breeding lines so that the results would be more directly applicable to breeding than those from a diversity panel. The population was genotyped with 71,710 SNPs using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and GWAS performed with the explicit goal of expediting selection in the breeding program. Using this breeding panel we identified 52 QTL for 11 agronomic traits, including large effect QTLs for flowering time and grain length/grain width/grain-length-breadth ratio. We also identified haplotypes that can be used to select plants in our population for short stature (plant height), early flowering time, and high yield, and thus demonstrate the utility of association mapping in breeding populations for informing breeding decisions. We conclude by exploring how the newly identified significant SNPs and insights into the genetic architecture of these quantitative traits can be leveraged to build genomic-assisted selection models.
25770588	Brassinosteroids are involved in Fe homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	J Exp Bot	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that modulate numerous physiological processes in plants. However, few studies have focused on the involvement of BRs in sensing and responding to the stress of mineral nutrient deficiency. In the present study, we evaluated the roles of BRs in the response of rice (Oryza sativa) to iron (Fe) deficiency during Fe uptake, transport, and translocation. Exogenous application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) to wild-type (WT) plants exaggerated leaf symptoms of Fe deficiency and suppressed growth. EBR increased and decreased Fe concentrations in roots and shoots, respectively, under both Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient conditions. Transcripts involved in Fe homeostasis, including OsIRT1, OsYSL15, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, and OsNAS2, were enhanced by EBR under Fe-deficient conditions. EBR depressed expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsYSL2 in shoots, and inhibited Fe transport and translocation via the phloem. Rice mutant d2-1, which is defective in BR biosynthesis, was more tolerant to Fe deficiency than the WT, and accumulated greater amounts of Fe in roots than the WT under Fe-sufficient conditions. A greater upregulation of OsIRT1, OsYSL15, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, and OsNAS2 in the d2-1 mutant compared to the WT was found under Fe-sufficient conditions, while expression of these genes in the d2-1 mutant was lower than in the WT under Fe-deficient conditions. The greater tolerance of the d2-1 mutant could be partly mitigated by exogenous application of EBR. These novel findings highlight the important role of BR in mediating the response of strategy II plants to Fe deficiency by regulating Fe uptake and translocation in rice.
25867306	Mapping quantitative trait loci for sheath blight disease resistance in Yangdao 4 rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Rice sheath blight (ShB), which is caused by Rhizoctonia solani, has become the most serious rice disease in China. Yangdao 4, a cultivar with partial resistance to ShB, was crossed with Lemont, a susceptible cultivar, to develop mapping populations that were used to analyze quantitative trait loci (QTL) that confer resistance to ShB. QTL analysis were performed in 3 environments (E1-E3) using 2 F2 and 1 F2:3 populations, respectively. Three traits were recorded to evaluate ShB resistance, including disease rating (DR), lesion height (LH), and percentage of lesion height (PLH). Based on field evaluation of ShB resistance and the 2 genetic maps constructed, we identified a total of 8 QTLs for DR (4 in E1, 4 in E2, and 3 in E3), 6 QTLs for LH (1 in E1, 3 in E2, and 2 in E3), and 7 QTLs for PLH (1 in E1, 4 in E2, and 2 in E3). Sixteen of the ShB-QTLs co-localized as 6 clusters on chromosomes 3, 7, 11, and 12. Four of the 6 clusters contained ShB-QTLs that were detected in 2 environments, while the other 2 clusters with ShB-QTLs were detected in 1 environment. Three ShB-QTLs (qSBD-3-2, qSBL-3-1, and qSBPL-3-1) were delimited to a 581-kb region flanked by markers D333B and D334 on chromosome 3. The resistance alleles of Yangdao 4 at the qSBD-3-2 locus decreased DR by 0.68 and 0.79 in E2 and E3, respectively.
25857777	Expression and purification of OsVDAC4.	2015	Methods Enzymol	The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a major component of the mitochondrial outer membrane, has emerged as an important player in cell function, survival, and death signaling. VDAC function is modulated by its interaction with proteins such as hexokinase, adenine nucleotide translocator, and apoptotic proteins like Bax. Monitoring the activity of VDAC and its modulation in the complex cellular milieu is fraught with complications. Minimizing the number of components in the study is one approach to teasing apart various aspects of its function. In this chapter, we have described detailed protocols for the purification of a rice VDAC isoform, OsVDAC4 after overexpression in a bacterial system. The protein is solubilized with LDAO and then reconstituted into liposomes or planar bilayers to verify its competence to fold into a functionally active form.
25821973	Transgenic expression of the dicotyledonous pattern recognition receptor EFR in rice leads to ligand-dependent activation of defense responses.	2015	PLoS Pathog	Plant plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect extracellular pathogen-associated molecules. PRRs such as Arabidopsis EFR and rice XA21 are taxonomically restricted and are absent from most plant genomes. Here we show that rice plants expressing EFR or the chimeric receptor EFR::XA21, containing the EFR ectodomain and the XA21 intracellular domain, sense both Escherichia coli- and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo)-derived elf18 peptides at sub-nanomolar concentrations. Treatment of EFR and EFR::XA21 rice leaf tissue with elf18 leads to MAP kinase activation, reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression. Although expression of EFR does not lead to robust enhanced resistance to fully virulent Xoo isolates, it does lead to quantitatively enhanced resistance to weakly virulent Xoo isolates. EFR interacts with OsSERK2 and the XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), two key components of the rice XA21-mediated immune response. Rice-EFR plants silenced for OsSERK2, or overexpressing rice XB24 are compromised in elf18-induced reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression indicating that these proteins are also important for EFR-mediated signaling in transgenic rice. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential feasibility of enhancing disease resistance in rice and possibly other monocotyledonous crop species by expression of dicotyledonous PRRs. Our results also suggest that Arabidopsis EFR utilizes at least a subset of the known endogenous rice XA21 signaling components.
25617323	Ectopic expression of myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase induces a wide range of metabolic changes and confers salt tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Salt stress is an important factor that limits crop production worldwide. The salt tolerance of plants is a complex biological process mediated by changes in gene expression and metabolite composition. The enzyme myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS; EC 5.5.1.4) catalyzes the first step of myo-inositol biosynthesis, and overexpression of the MIPS gene enhances salt stress tolerance in several plant species. In this study, we performed metabolite profiling of both MIPS-overexpressing and wild-type rice. The enhanced salt stress tolerance of MIPS-overexpressing plants was clear based on growth and the metabolites under salt stress. We found that constitutive overexpression of the rice MIPS gene resulted in a wide range of metabolic changes. This study demonstrates for the first time that overexpression of the MIPS gene increases various metabolites responsible for protecting plants from abiotic stress. Activation of both basal metabolism, such as glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and inositol metabolism is induced in MIPS-overexpressing plants. We discuss the relationship between the metabolic changes and the improved salt tolerance observed in transgenic rice.
25739079	Chloroplast-expressed MSI-99 in tobacco improves disease resistance and displays inhibitory effect against rice blast fungus.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Rice blast is a major destructive fungal disease that poses a serious threat to rice production and the improvement of blast resistance is critical to rice breeding. The antimicrobial peptide MSI-99 has been suggested as an antimicrobial peptide conferring resistance to bacterial and fungal diseases. Here, a vector harboring the MSI-99 gene was constructed and introduced into the tobacco chloroplast genome via particle bombardment. Transformed plants were obtained and verified to be homoplastomic by PCR and Southern hybridization. In planta assays demonstrated that the transgenic tobacco plants displayed an enhanced resistance to the fungal disease. The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity revealed that the crude protein extracts from the transgenic plants manifested an antimicrobial activity against E. coli, even after incubation at 120 °C for 20 min, indicating significant heat stability of MSI-99. More importantly, the MSI-99-containing protein extracts were firstly proved in vitro and in vivo to display significant suppressive effects on two rice blast isolates. These findings provide a strong basis for the development of new biopesticides to combat rice blast.
25844120	Allelic effects on starch structure and properties of six starch biosynthetic genes in a rice recombinant inbred line population.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of six starch biosynthetic genes (Wx, SSI, SSIIa, SBEI, SBEIIa and SBEIIb) in indica and japonica rices opens an opportunity to produce a new variety with more favourable grain starch quality. However, there is limited information about the effects of these six gene allele combinations on starch structure and properties. A recombinant inbred line population from a cross between indica and japonica varieties offers opportunities to combine specific alleles of the six genes.

RESULTS: The allelic (indica vs japonica) effects of six starch biosynthetic genes on starch structure, functional properties, and abundance of granule bound proteins in rice grains were investigated in a common genetic background using a recombinant inbred line population. The indica Wx (Wxi) allele played a major role while indica SSI (SSIi), japonica SSIIa (SSIIaj) and indica SBEI (SBEIi) alleles had minor roles on the increase of amylose content. SSIIaj and japonica SBEIIb (SBEIIbj) alleles had a major and a minor role on high ratio of ∑DP ≤ 10 to ∑DP ≤ 24 fractions (RCL10/24), respectively. Both major alleles (Wxi and SSIIaj) reduced peak viscosity (PV), onset, peak and end gelatinization temperatures (GTs) of amylopectin, and increased amylose-lipid complex dissociation enthalpy compared with their counterpart-alleles, respectively. SBEIIai and SBEIIbj decreased PV, whereas SSIi and SBEIIbj decreased FV. SBEIi reduced setback viscosity and gelatinization enthalpy. RCL10/24 of chain length distribution in amylopectin is negatively correlated with PV and BD of paste property and GTs of thermal properties. We also report RILs with superior starch properties combining Wxi, SSIj, SSIIaj, SBEIi and SBEIIbj alleles. Additionally, a clear relation is drawn to starch biosynthetic gene alleles, starch structure, properties, and abundance of granule bound starch biosynthetic enzymes inside starch granules.

CONCLUSIONS: Rice Wxi and SSIIaj alleles play major roles, while SSIi, SBEIi, SBEIIai and SBEIIbj alleles have minor roles in the determination of starch properties between indica and japonica rice through starch structural modification. The combination of these alleles is a key factor for starch quality improvement in rice breeding programs. RCL10/24 value is critical for starch structure and property determination.
25853032	Expression and functional validation of heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) and cholera toxin B (CTB) subunits in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Springerplus	We expressed the heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) subunit from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and the cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit from Vibrio cholerae under the control of the rice (Oryza sativa) globulin (Glb) promoter. Binding of recombinant LTB and CTB proteins was confirmed based on GM1-ganglioside binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (GM1-ELISA). Real-time PCR of three generations (T3, T4, and T5) in homozygous lines (LCI-11) showed single copies of LTB, CTB, bar and Tnos. LTB and CTB proteins in rice transgenic lines were detected by Western blot analysis. Immunogenicity trials of rice-derived CTB and LTB antigens were evaluated through oral and intraperitoneal administration in mice, respectively. The results revealed that LTB- and CTB-specific IgG levels were enhanced in the sera of intraperitoneally immunized mice. Similarly, the toxin-neutralizing activity of CTB and LTB in serum of orally immunized mice was associated with elevated levels of both IgG and IgA. The results of the present study suggest that the combined expression of CTB and LTB proteins can be utilized to produce vaccines against enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera, for the prevention of diarrhea.
25819088	Downregulation of rice DWARF 14 LIKE suppress mesocotyl elongation via a strigolactone independent pathway in the dark.	2015	J Genet Genomics	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that control plant development in response to environmental conditions. In rice, mesocotyl elongation is regulated by SLs in the dark, while mesocotyls are longer in SL deficient or insensitive mutants. SLs are perceived by DWARF14 (D14), which is a member of a small gene family. In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth. The mesocotyls of D14L RNAi lines are longer than those of WT in the dark. This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation. This phenotype is alleviated by the exogenous supply of GR24, a synthetic SL, suggesting that D14L is not necessary for SL signaling. D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia. Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively.
25844121	QTLs underlying natural variation of root growth angle among rice cultivars with the same functional allele of DEEPER ROOTING 1.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The functional allele of the rice gene DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) increases the root growth angle (RGA). However, wide natural variation in RGA is observed among rice cultivars with the functional DRO1 allele. To elucidate genetic factors related to such variation, we quantitatively measured RGA using the basket method and analyzed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for RGA in three F2 mapping populations derived from crosses between the large RGA-type cultivar Kinandang Patong and each of three accessions with varying RGA: Momiroman has small RGA and was used to produce the MoK-F2 population; Yumeaoba has intermediate RGA (YuK-F2 population); Tachisugata has large RGA (TaK-F2 population). All four accessions belong to the same haplotype group of functional DRO1 allele.

RESULTS: We detected the following statistically significant QTLs: one QTL on chromosome 4 in MoK-F2, three QTLs on chromosomes 2, 4, and 6 in YuK-F2, and one QTL on chromosome 2 in TaK-F2. Among them, the two QTLs on chromosome 4 were located near DRO2, which has been previously reported as a major QTL for RGA, whereas the two major QTLs for RGA on chromosomes 2 (DRO4) and 6 (DRO5) were novel. With the LOD threshold reduced to 3.0, several minor QTLs for RGA were also detected in each population.

CONCLUSION: Natural variation in RGA in rice cultivars carrying functional DRO1 alleles may be controlled by a few major QTLs and by several additional minor QTLs.
25870602	Development of salinity tolerance in rice by constitutive-overexpression of genes involved in the regulation of programmed cell death.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Environmental factors contribute to over 70% of crop yield losses worldwide. Of these drought and salinity are the most significant causes of crop yield reduction. Rice is an important staple crop that feeds more than half of the world's population. However among the agronomically important cereals rice is the most sensitive to salinity. In the present study we show that exogenous expression of anti-apoptotic genes from diverse origins, AtBAG4 (Arabidopsis), Hsp70 (Citrus tristeza virus) and p35 (Baculovirus), significantly improves salinity tolerance in rice at the whole plant level. Physiological, biochemical and agronomical analyses of transgenic rice expressing each of the anti-apoptotic genes subjected to salinity treatment demonstrated traits associated with tolerant varieties including, improved photosynthesis, membrane integrity, ion and ROS maintenance systems, growth rate, and yield components. Moreover, FTIR analysis showed that the chemical composition of salinity-treated transgenic plants is reminiscent of non-treated, unstressed controls. In contrast, wild type and vector control plants displayed hallmark features of stress, including pectin degradation upon subjection to salinity treatment. Interestingly, despite their diverse origins, transgenic plants expressing the anti-apoptotic genes assessed in this study displayed similar physiological and biochemical characteristics during salinity treatment thus providing further evidence that cell death pathways are conserved across broad evolutionary kingdoms. Our results reveal that anti-apoptotic genes facilitate maintenance of metabolic activity at the whole plant level to create favorable conditions for cellular survival. It is these conditions that are crucial and conducive to the plants ability to tolerate/adapt to extreme environments.
25793471	Quantitative proteomic analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) salt response.	2015	PLoS One	Salt stress is one of most serious limiting factors for crop growth and production. An isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) approach was used to analyze proteomic changes in rice shoots under salt stress in this study. A total of 56 proteins were significantly altered and 16 of them were enriched in the pathways of photosynthesis, antioxidant and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these 16 proteins, peroxiredoxin Q and photosystem I subunit D were up-regulated, while thioredoxin M-like, thioredoxin x, thioredoxin peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase F3, PSI subunit H, light-harvesting antenna complex I subunits, chloroplast chaperonin, vacuolar ATP synthase subunit H, and ATP synthase delta chain were down-regulated. Moreover, physiological data including total antioxidant capacity, peroxiredoxin activity, chlorophyll a/b content, glutathione S-transferase activity, reduced glutathione content and ATPase activity were consistent with changes in the levels of these proteins. The levels of the mRNAs encoding these proteins were also analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and approximately 86% of the results were consistent with the iTRAQ data. Importantly, our data suggest the important role of PSI in balancing energy supply and ROS generation under salt stress. This study provides information for an improved understanding of the function of photosynthesis and PSI in the salt-stress response of rice.
25761674	Brassinosteroids play a critical role in the regulation of pesticide metabolism in crop plants.	2015	Sci Rep	Pesticide residues in agricultural produce pose a threat to human health worldwide. Although the detoxification mechanisms for xenobiotics have been extensively studied in mammalian cells, information about the regulation network in plants remains elusive. Here we show that brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of natural plant hormones, decreased residues of common organophosphorus, organochlorine and carbamate pesticides by 30-70% on tomato, rice, tea, broccoli, cucumber, strawberry, and other plants when treated externally. Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that fungicide chlorothalonil (CHT) and BR co-upregulated 301 genes, including a set of detoxifying genes encoding cytochrome P450, oxidoreductase, hydrolase and transferase in tomato plants. The level of BRs was closely related to the respiratory burst oxidase 1 (RBOH1)-encoded NADPH oxides-dependent H2O2 production, glutathione biosynthesis and the redox homeostasis, and the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Gene silencing treatments showed that BRs decreased pesticide residues in plants likely by promoting their metabolism through a signaling pathway involving BRs-induced H2O2 production and cellular redox change. Our study provided a novel approach for minimizing pesticide residues in crops by exploiting plants' own detoxification mechanisms.
25809845	Development of genome-wide insertion/deletion markers in rice based on graphic pipeline platform.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	DNA markers play important roles in plant breeding and genetics. The Insertion/Deletion (InDel) marker is one kind of co-dominant DNA markers widely used due to its low cost and high precision. However, the canonical way of searching for InDel markers is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We developed an end-to-end computational solution (InDel Markers Development Platform, IMDP) to identify genome-wide InDel markers under a graphic pipeline environment. IMDP constitutes assembled genome sequences alignment pipeline (AGA-pipe) and next-generation re-sequencing data mapping pipeline (NGS-pipe). With AGA-pipe we are able to identify 12,944 markers between the genome of rice cultivars Nipponbare and 93-11. Using NGS-pipe, we reported 34,794 InDels from re-sequencing data of rice cultivars Wu-Yun-Geng7 and Guang-Lu-Ai4. Combining AGA-pipe and NGS-pipe, we developed 205,659 InDels in eight japonica and nine indica cultivars and 2,681 InDels showed a subgroup-specific pattern. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of subgroup-specific markers indicated that the precision reached 90% (86 of 95). Finally, to make them available to the public, we have integrated the InDels/markers information into a website (Rice InDel Marker Database, RIMD, http://202.120.45.71/). The application of IMDP in rice will facilitate efficiency for development of genome-wide InDel markers, in addition it can be used in other species with reference genome sequences and NGS data.
25780769	Improvement of enzymatic saccharification yield in Arabidopsis thaliana by ectopic expression of the rice SUB1A-1 transcription factor.	2015	PeerJ	Saccharification of polysaccharides releases monosaccharides that can be used by ethanol-producing microorganisms in biofuel production. To improve plant biomass as a raw material for saccharification, factors controlling the accumulation and structure of carbohydrates must be identified. Rice SUB1A-1 is a transcription factor that represses the turnover of starch and postpones energy-consuming growth processes under submergence stress. Arabidopsis was employed to test if heterologous expression of SUB1A-1 or SUB1C-1 (a related gene) can be used to improve saccharification. Cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymatic treatments confirmed that SUB1A-1 transgenics had better saccharification yield than wild-type (Col-0), mainly from accumulated starch. This improved saccharification yield was developmentally controlled; when compared to Col-0, young transgenic vegetative plants yielded 200-300% more glucose, adult vegetative plants yielded 40-90% more glucose and plants in reproductive stage had no difference in yield. We measured photosynthetic parameters, starch granule microstructure, and transcript abundance of genes involved in starch degradation (SEX4, GWD1), juvenile transition (SPL3-5) and meristematic identity (FUL, SOC1) but found no differences to Col-0, indicating that starch accumulation may be controlled by down-regulation of CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T by SUB1A-1 as previously reported. SUB1A-1 transgenics also offered less resistance to deformation than wild-type concomitant to up-regulation of AtEXP2 expansin and BGL2 glucan-1,3,-beta-glucosidase. We conclude that heterologous SUB1A-1 expression can improve saccharification yield and softness, two traits needed in bioethanol production.
25786239	Overexpressing CYP71Z2 enhances resistance to bacterial blight by suppressing auxin biosynthesis in rice.	2015	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The hormone auxin plays an important role not only in the growth and development of rice, but also in its defense responses. We've previously shown that the P450 gene CYP71Z2 enhances disease resistance to pathogens through regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice, though it remains unclear if auxin is involved in this process or not.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The expression of CYP71Z2 was induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) inoculation was analyzed by qRT-PCR, with GUS histochemical staining showing that CYP71Z2 expression was limited to roots, blades and nodes. Overexpression of CYP71Z2 in rice durably and stably increased resistance to Xoo, though no significant difference in disease resistance was detected between CYP71Z2-RNA interference (RNAi) rice and wild-type. Moreover, IAA concentration was determined using the HPLC/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry system. The accumulation of IAA was significantly reduced in CYP71Z2-overexpressing rice regardless of whether plants were inoculated or not, whereas it was unaffected in CYP71Z2-RNAi rice. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to IAA, expansin and SA/JA signaling pathways was suppressed in CYP71Z2-overexpressing rice with or without inoculation.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that CYP71Z2-mediated resistance to Xoo may be via suppression of IAA signaling in rice. Our studies also provide comprehensive insight into molecular mechanism of resistance to Xoo mediated by IAA in rice. Moreover, an available approach for understanding the P450 gene functions in interaction between rice and pathogens has been provided.
25784715	Nitric oxide generated by nitrate reductase increases nitrogen uptake capacity by inducing lateral root formation and inorganic nitrogen uptake under partial nitrate nutrition in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Increasing evidence shows that partial nitrate nutrition (PNN) can be attributed to improved plant growth and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) in rice. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signalling molecule involved in many physiological processes during plant development and nitrogen (N) assimilation. It remains unclear whether molecular NO improves NUE through PNN. Two rice cultivars (cvs Nanguang and Elio), with high and low NUE, respectively, were used in the analysis of NO production, nitrate reductase (NR) activity, lateral root (LR) density, and (15)N uptake under PNN, with or without NO production donor and inhibitors. PNN increased NO accumulation in cv. Nanguang possibly through the NIA2-dependent NR pathway. PNN-mediated NO increases contributed to LR initiation, (15)NH₄(+)/(15)NO₃(-) influx into the root, and levels of ammonium and nitrate transporters in cv. Nanguang but not cv. Elio. Further results revealed marked and specific induction of LR initiation and (15)NH₄(+)/(15)NO₃(-) influx into the roots of plants supplied with NH₄(+)+sodium nitroprusside (SNP) relative to those supplied with NH₄(+) alone, and considerable inhibition upon the application of cPTIO or tungstate (NR inhibitor) in addition to PNN, which is in agreement with the change in NO fluorescence in the two rice cultivars. The findings suggest that NO generated by the NR pathway plays a pivotal role in improving the N acquisition capacity by increasing LR initiation and the inorganic N uptake rate, which may represent a strategy for rice plants to adapt to a fluctuating nitrate supply and increase NUE.
25790260	Identification of genomic regions and the isoamylase gene for reduced grain chalkiness in rice.	2015	PLoS One	Grain chalkiness is an important grain quality related to starch granules in the endosperm. A high percentage of grain chalkiness is a major problem because it diminishes grain quality in rice. Here, we report quantitative trait loci identification for grain chalkiness using high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of a chromosomal segment substitution line population in which each line carried one or a few introduced japonica cultivar Nipponbare segments in the genetic background of the indica cultivar ZS97. Ten quantitative trait loci regions were commonly identified for the percentage of grain chalkiness and the degree of endosperm chalkiness. The allelic effects at nine of these quantitative trait loci reduced grain chalkiness. Furthermore, a quantitative trait locus (qPGC8-2) on chromosome 8 was validated in a chromosomal segment substitution line-derived segregation population, and had a stable effect on chalkiness in a multiple-environment evaluation of the near-isogenic lines. Residing on the qPGC8-2 region, the isoamylase gene (ISA1) was preferentially expressed in the endosperm and revealed some nucleotide polymorphisms between two varieties, Nipponbare and ZS97. Transgenic lines with suppression of ISA1 by RNA interference produced grains with 20% more chalkiness than the control. The results support that the gene may underlie qPGC8-2 for grain chalkiness. The multiple-environment trials of the near-isogenic lines also show that combination of the favorable alleles such as the ISA1 gene for low chalkiness and the GS3 gene for long grains considerably improved grain quality of ZS97, which proves useful for grain quality improvement in rice breeding programs.
25588693	Differential competence of redox-regulatory mechanism under extremes of temperature determines growth performances and cross tolerance in two indica rice cultivars.	2015	J Plant Physiol	The present study investigated the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation (total and individual), antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity (total and individual), transcript abundance of some antioxidative genes and oxidative damages to membrane protein and lipid in germinating tissues of a salt resistant (SR26B) and salt sensitive (Ratna) rice cultivars under extremes of temperature to elucidate redox-regulatory mechanism governing differential oxidative stress tolerance associated with better growth and yield potential and identification of cross tolerance, if any. Imbibitional heat and chilling stress caused disruption of redox-homeostasis and oxidative damage to a newly assembled membrane system by increasing pro-oxidant/antioxidant ratio and by aggravating membrane lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation [measured in terms of accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free carbonyl content (CO groups), and membrane protein thiol level (MPTL)]. A concomitant increase in accumulation of individual ROS (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and significant reduction of radical scavenging activity (assessed in terms of ABTS, FRAP and DPPH methods), non-enzymatic and enzymatic anti-oxidative defense [assessed in terms of total thiol content and activities of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11), and glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2)] are also noticed in both the salt sensitive (Ratna) and resistant (SR26B) germinating tissues of rice cultivars. When compared, salt resistant cultivar SR26B was found to suffer significantly less redox-imbalance and related oxidative damages to membrane protein and lipid as compared to salt sensitive cultivar Ratna. The salt tolerant cultivar SR26B resisted imbibitional chilling and heat stress due to its early preparedness to combat oxidative stress by up-regulation of gene expression of anti-oxidative enzymes and better capacity of redox-regulation and mitigation of oxidative damage to membrane protein and lipid as compared to salt sensitive cultivar Ratna, under the same magnitude of imbibitional heat and chilling stress. A model for redox-homeostasis in which the ROS-antioxidant interaction acts as a metabolic interface for up-regulation of gene expression necessary for cross tolerance is also proposed.
25834216	Comparative Genetics of Seed Size Traits in Divergent Cereal Lineages Represented by Sorghum (Panicoidae) and Rice (Oryzoidae).	2015	G3 (Bethesda)	Seed size is closely related to fitness of wild plants, and its modification has been a key recurring element in domestication of seed/grain crops. In sorghum, a genomic and morphological model for panicoid cereals, a rich history of research into the genetics of seed size is reflected by a total of 13 likelihood intervals determined by conventional QTL (linkage) mapping in 11 nonoverlapping regions of the genome. To complement QTL data and investigate whether the discovery of seed size QTL is approaching "saturation," we compared QTL data to GWAS for seed mass, seed length, and seed width studied in 354 accessions from a sorghum association panel (SAP) that have been genotyped at 265,487 SNPs. We identified nine independent GWAS-based "hotspots" for seed size associations. Targeted resequencing near four association peaks with the most notable linkage disequilibrium provides further support of the role(s) of these regions in the genetic control of sorghum seed size and identifies two candidate causal variants with nonsynonymous mutations. Of nine GWAS hotspots in sorghum, seven have significant correspondence with rice QTL intervals and known genes for components of seed size on orthologous chromosomes. Identifying intersections between positional and association genetic data are a potentially powerful means to mitigate constraints associated with each approach, and nonrandom correspondence of sorghum (panicoid) GWAS signals to rice (oryzoid) QTL adds a new dimension to the ability to leverage genetic data about this important trait across divergent plants.
25813048	RiceNet v2: an improved network prioritization server for rice genes.	2015	Nucleic Acids Res	Rice is the most important staple food crop and a model grass for studies of bioenergy crops. We previously published a genome-scale functional network server called RiceNet, constructed by integrating diverse genomics data and demonstrated the use of the network in genetic dissection of rice biotic stress responses and its usefulness for other grass species. Since the initial construction of the network, there has been a significant increase in the amount of publicly available rice genomics data. Here, we present an updated network prioritization server for Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, RiceNet v2 (http://www.inetbio.org/ricenet), which provides a network of 25 765 genes (70.1% of the coding genome) and 1 775 000 co-functional links. Ricenet v2 also provides two complementary methods for network prioritization based on: (i) network direct neighborhood and (ii) context-associated hubs. RiceNet v2 can use genes of the related subspecies O. sativa ssp. indica and the reference plant Arabidopsis for versatility in generating hypotheses. We demonstrate that RiceNet v2 effectively identifies candidate genes involved in rice root/shoot development and defense responses, demonstrating its usefulness for the grass research community.
25460871	Enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice over-expressing of maize C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene via NO and Ca(2+).	2015	J Plant Physiol	We determined the effects of endogenous nitric oxide and Ca(2+) on photosynthesis and gene expression in transgenic rice plants (PC) over-expressing the maize C4pepc gene, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) under drought. In this study, seedlings were subjected to PEG 6000 treatments using PC and wild type (WT; Kitaake). The results showed that, compared with WT, PC had higher relative water content (RWC) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) under drought. During a 2-day re-watering treatment, Pn recovered faster in PC than in WT. Further analyses showed that, under the drought treatment, the amount of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased in WT mainly via NADPH oxidase. While in PC, the endogenous nitric oxide (NO) content increased via nitrate reductase and nitric oxide synthase on day 2 of the drought treatment and day 1 of the re-watering treatment. After 2 days of drought treatment, PC also showed higher PEPC activity, calcium content, phospholipase D (PLD) activity, C4-pepc and NAC6 transcript levels, and protein kinase activity as compared with PC without treatment. These changes did not occur in WT. Correlation analysis also proved NO associated with these indicators in PC. Based on these results, there was a particular molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in PC. The mechanism is related to the signaling processes via NO and Ca(2+) involving the protein kinase and the transcription factor, resulted in up-regulation of PEPC activity and its gene expression, such as C4pepc. Some genes encode antioxidant system, cu/zn-sod as well, which promote antioxidant system to clear MDA and superoxide anion radical, thereby conferring drought tolerance.
25822994	Genome-wide survey and expression analysis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases (CrPUBs) reveal a functional lipid metabolism module.	2015	PLoS One	E3 ubiquitin ligases determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination. Plant U-box (PUB) E3 ligases, with a typical 70-amino acid U-box domain, participate in plant developmental processes and environmental responses. Thus far, 64 PUB proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis and 77 PUB proteins have been identified in Oryza. However, detailed studies on U-box genes in the model microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the genes encoding U-box family proteins in C. reinhardtii. Following BLASTP analysis, 30 full-length U-box genes were identified in the C. reinhardtii genome sequence. Bioinformatics analyses of CrPUB genes were performed to characterize the phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal locations and gene structures of each member. The 30 identified CrPUB proteins are clustered into 3 distinct subfamilies, and the genes for these proteins are unevenly distributed among 14 chromosomes. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time RT-PCR or semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 30 CrPUB mRNA abundances under nitrogen starvation showed that 18 CrPUB genes were induced by N starvation and that 7 genes were repressed in the N-poor environment. We selected five CrPUB genes exhibiting marked changes in expression under N-free conditions for further analysis in RNAi experiments and examined the oil content of these gene-silenced transgenic strains. The silencing of CrPUB5 and CrPUB14, which are typically down-regulated under N starvation, induced 9.8%-45.0% and 14.4%-61.8% lipid accumulation, respectively. In contrast, the silencing of CrPUB11, CrPUB23 and CrPUB28, which are markedly up-regulated under N-free conditions, decreased the lipid content by 5.5%-27.8%, 8.1%-27.3% and 6.6%-27.9%, respectively. These results provide a useful reference for the identification and functional analysis of this gene family and fundamental information for microalgae lipid metabolism research.
25739330	Loss-of-function mutation of rice SLAC7 decreases chloroplast stability and induces a photoprotection mechanism in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Plants absorb sunlight to power the photochemical reactions of photosynthesis, which can potentially damage the photosynthetic machinery. However, the mechanism that protects chloroplasts from the damage remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrated that rice (Oryza sativa L.) SLAC7 is a generally expressed membrane protein. Loss-of-function of SLAC7 caused continuous damage to the chloroplasts of mutant leaves under normal light conditions. Ion leakage indicators related to leaf damage such as H2 O2 and abscisic acid levels were significantly higher in slac7-1 than in the wild type. Consistently, the photosynthesis efficiency and Fv/Fm ratio of slac7-1 were significantly decreased (similar to photoinhibition). In response to chloroplast damage, slac7-1 altered its leaf morphology (curled or fused leaf) by the synergy between plant hormones and transcriptional factors to decrease the absorption of light, suggesting that a photoprotection mechanism for chloroplast damage was activated in slac7-1. When grown in dark conditions, slac7-1 displayed a normal phenotype. SLAC7 under the control of the AtSLAC1 promoter could partially complement the phenotypes of Arabidopsis slac1 mutants, indicating a partial conservation of SLAC protein functions. These results suggest that SLAC7 is essential for maintaining the chloroplast stability in rice.
25765580	Enhancement of recombinant human serum albumin in transgenic rice cell culture system by cultivation strategy.	2015	N Biotechnol	Fusion of the sugar-starvation-induced αAmy3 promoter with its signal peptide has enabled secretion of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) into the culture medium. To simplify the production process and increase the rHSA yield in rice suspension cells, a one-step strategem without medium change was adopted. The yield of rHSA was increased sixfold by this one-step approach compared with the two-step recombinant protein process, in which a change of the culture medium to sugar-free medium is required. The one-step strategem was applied to check repeated cycle of rHSA production, and the production of rHSA was also higher in each cycle in the one-step, as opposed to the two-step, production process. The use of the one-step process resulted in fewer damaged cells during the cell sugar starvation phase for recombinant protein production. Furthermore, we scaled up the rHSA production in a 2-L airlift and a 2-L stirred tank bioreactor by the one-step approach, and concluded that rHSA can be enriched to 45 mg L(-1) in plant culture commonly used MS medium by the airlift-type bioreactor. Our results suggest that rHSA production can be enriched by this optimized cultivation strategem.
25744417	Conferred resistance to Botrytis cinerea in Lilium by overexpression of the RCH10 chitinase gene.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Transgenic Lilium lines have been generated by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation that have enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea as a consequence of ectopic expression of a rice chitinase gene. The production of ornamentals is an important global industry, with Lilium being one of the six major bulb crops in the world. The international trade in ornamentals is in the order of £60-75 billion and is expected to increase worldwide by 2-4% per annum. The continued success of the floriculture industry depends on the introduction of new species/cultivars with major alterations in key agronomic characteristics, such as resistance to pathogens. Fungal diseases are the cause of reduced yields and marketable quality of cultivated plants, including ornamental species. The fungal pathogen Botrytis causes extreme economic losses to a wide range of crop species, including ornamentals such as Lilium. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to develop Lilium oriental cv. 'Star Gazer' plants that ectopically overexpress the Rice Chitinase 10 gene (RCH10), under control of the CaMV35S promoter. Levels of conferred resistance linked to chitinase expression were evaluated by infection with Botrytis cinerea; sporulation was reduced in an in vitro assay and the relative expression of the RCH10 gene was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. The extent of resistance to Botrytis, compared to that of the wild type plants, showed a direct correlation with the level of chitinase gene expression. Transgenic plants grown to flowering showed no detrimental phenotypic effects associated with transgene expression. This is the first report of Lilium plants with resistance to Botrytis cinerea generated by a transgenic approach.
25790283	Comparative analysis of disease-linked single nucleotide polymorphic markers from Brassica rapa for their applicability to Brassica oleracea.	2015	PLoS One	Numerous studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been conducted in humans, and other animals, and in major crops, including rice, soybean, and Chinese cabbage. However, the number of SNP studies in cabbage is limited. In this present study, we evaluated whether 7,645 SNPs previously identified as molecular markers linked to disease resistance in the Brassica rapa genome could be applied to B. oleracea. In a BLAST analysis using the SNP sequences of B. rapa and B. oleracea genomic sequence data registered in the NCBI database, 256 genes for which SNPs had been identified in B. rapa were found in B. oleracea. These genes were classified into three functional groups: molecular function (64 genes), biological process (96 genes), and cellular component (96 genes). A total of 693 SNP markers, including 145 SNP markers [BRH--developed from the B. rapa genome for high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis], 425 SNP markers (BRP--based on the B. rapa genome that could be applied to B. oleracea), and 123 new SNP markers (BRS--derived from BRP and designed for HRM analysis), were investigated for their ability to amplify sequences from cabbage genomic DNA. In total, 425 of the SNP markers (BRP-based on B. rapa genome), selected from 7,645 SNPs, were successfully applied to B. oleracea. Using PCR, 108 of 145 BRH (74.5%), 415 of 425 BRP (97.6%), and 118 of 123 BRS (95.9%) showed amplification, suggesting that it is possible to apply SNP markers developed based on the B. rapa genome to B. oleracea. These results provide valuable information that can be utilized in cabbage genetics and breeding programs using molecular markers derived from other Brassica species.
25828885	New insights into an RNAi approach for plant defence against piercing-sucking and stem-borer insect pests.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Insect double-stranded (ds)RNA expression in transgenic crops can increase plant resistance to biotic stress; however, creating transgenic crops to defend against every insect pest is impractical. Arabidopsis Mob1A is required for organ growth and reproduction. When Arabidopsis roots were soaked in dsMob1A, the root lengths and numbers were significantly suppressed and plants could not bolt or flower. Twenty-four hours after rice roots were immersed in fluorescent-labelled dsEYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein), fluorescence was observed in the rice sheath and stem and in planthoppers feeding on the rice. The expression levels of Ago and Dicer in rice and planthoppers were induced by dsEYFP. When rice roots were soaked in dsActin, their growth was also significantly suppressed. When planthoppers or Asian corn borers fed on rice or maize that had been irrigated with a solution containing the dsRNA of an insect target gene, the insect's mortality rate increased significantly. Our results demonstrate that dsRNAs can be absorbed by crop roots, trigger plant and insect RNAi and enhance piercing-sucking and stem-borer insect mortality rates. We also confirmed that dsRNA was stable under outdoor conditions. These results indicate that the root dsRNA soaking can be used as a bioinsecticide strategy during crop irrigation.
25725011	The battle for chitin recognition in plant-microbe interactions.	2015	FEMS Microbiol Rev	Fungal cell walls play dynamic functions in interaction of fungi with their surroundings. In pathogenic fungi, the cell wall is the first structure to make physical contact with host cells. An important structural component of fungal cell walls is chitin, a well-known elicitor of immune responses in plants. Research into chitin perception has sparked since the chitin receptor from rice was cloned nearly a decade ago. Considering the widespread nature of chitin perception in plants, pathogens evidently evolved strategies to overcome detection, including alterations in the composition of cell walls, modification of their carbohydrate chains and secretion of effectors to provide cell wall protection or target host immune responses. Also non-pathogenic fungi contain chitin in their cell walls and are recipients of immune responses. Intriguingly, various mutualists employ chitin-derived signaling molecules to prepare their hosts for the mutualistic relationship. Research on the various types of interactions has revealed different molecular components that play crucial roles and, moreover, that various chitin-binding proteins contain dissimilar chitin-binding domains across species that differ in affinity and specificity. Considering the various strategies from microbes and hosts focused on chitin recognition, it is evident that this carbohydrate plays a central role in plant-fungus interactions.
25790128	Genetic analysis of cold tolerance at the germination and booting stages in rice by association mapping.	2015	PLoS One	Low temperature affects the rice plants at all stages of growth. It can cause severe seedling injury and male sterility resulting in severe yield losses. Using a mini core collection of 174 Chinese rice accessions and 273 SSR markers we investigated cold tolerance at the germination and booting stages, as well as the underlying genetic bases, by association mapping. Two distinct populations, corresponding to subspecies indica and japonica showed evident differences in cold tolerance and its genetic basis. Both subspecies were sensitive to cold stress at both growth stages. However, japonica was more tolerant than indica at all stages as measured by seedling survival and seed setting. There was a low correlation in cold tolerance between the germination and booting stages. Fifty one quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cold tolerance were dispersed across all 12 chromosomes; 22 detected at the germination stage and 33 at the booting stage. Eight QTLs were identified by at least two of four measures. About 46% of the QTLs represented new loci. The only QTL shared between indica and japonica for the same measure was qLTSSvR6-2 for SSvR. This implied a complicated mechanism of old tolerance between the two subspecies. According to the relative genotypic effect (RGE) of each genotype for each QTL, we detected 18 positive genotypes and 21 negative genotypes in indica, and 19 positive genotypes and 24 negative genotypes in japonica. In general, the negative effects were much stronger than the positive effects in both subspecies. Markers for QTL with positive effects in one subspecies were shown to be effective for selection of cold tolerance in that subspecies, but not in the other subspecies. QTL with strong negative effects on cold tolerance should be avoided during MAS breeding so as to not cancel the effect of favorable QTL at other loci.
25762131	qAC2, a novel QTL that interacts with Wx and controls the low amylose content in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: This manuscript reports the fine mapping of a novel QTL, qAC2 controlling the low amylose in rice. The action mechanism of the qAC2 is also investigated by the analysis of genetic interactions to Wx (a), Wx (b), du1, du2 and du3. Amylose content of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm greatly affects starch properties and eating quality of cooked rice. Seeds of japonica rice cultivar Kuiku162 have low amylose content (AC) and good eating quality. Our analysis revealed a novel QTL, designated as qAC2 that contributed to the low AC of Kuiku162. qAC2 was fine mapped within a 74.9-kb region between two insertion and deletion markers, KID3001 and KID5101, on the long arm of chromosome 2. Seven genes are predicted in this region, but none of them is known to be related to the regulation of AC. The AC of a near-isogenic line (NIL110) carrying qAC2 (Kuiku), the Kuiku162 allele of qAC2, in the genetic background of japonica cultivar Itadaki was lower by 1.1% points than that of Itadaki. The chain length distributions of amylopectin were similar in NIL110 and Itadaki; therefore, the low AC of NIL110 was caused by a decrease in the actual AC, but not by a difference in the amylopectin structure. The interaction analyses revealed that qAC2 (Kuiku) has epistatic interaction with Wx (a). The qAC2 (Kuiku) has epistatic interactions with two loci, du1 and du2, on Wx (b), whereas the genetic effect of qAC2 (Kuiku) has additive to that of du3 on Wx (b). Thus, similar to du1 and du2, qAC2 may have a function related to Wx (b) mRNA splicing.
25830863	PDH45 overexpressing transgenic tobacco and rice plants provide salinity stress tolerance via less sodium accumulation.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Salinity stress negatively affects the crop productivity worldwide, including that of rice. Coping with these losses is a major concern for all countries. The pea DNA helicase, PDH45 is a unique member of helicase family involved in the salinity stress tolerance. However, the exact mechanism of the PDH45 in salinity stress tolerance is yet to be established. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of PDH45-mediated salinity stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco and rice lines along with wild type (WT) plants using CoroNa Green dye based sodium localization in root and shoot sections. The results showed that under salinity stress root and shoot of PDH45 overexpressing transgenic tobacco and rice accumulated less sodium (Na(+)) as compared to their respective WT. The present study also reports salinity tolerant (FL478) and salinity susceptible (Pusa-44) varieties of rice accumulated lowest and highest Na(+) level, respectively. All the varieties and transgenic lines of rice accumulate differential Na(+) ions in root and shoot. However, roots accumulate high Na(+) as compared to the shoots in both tobacco and rice transgenic lines suggesting that the Na(+) transport in shoot is somehow inhibited. It is proposed that the PDH45 is probably involved in the deposition of apoplastic hydrophobic barriers and consequently inhibit Na(+) transport to shoot and therefore confers salinity stress tolerance to PDH45 overexpressing transgenic lines. This study concludes that tobacco (dicot) and rice (monocot) transgenic plants probably share common salinity tolerance mechanism mediated by PDH45 gene.
25732383	Do rice suspension-cultured cells treated with abscisic acid mimic developing seeds?	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Starch synthesis is activated in the endosperm during seed development and also in rice suspension cells cultured with abscisic acid. In the anticipation that the mechanisms of starch synthesis are similar between the endosperm and the suspension cells cultured with abscisic acid, expression of genes involved in starch synthesis was evaluated in the suspension cells after abscisic acid treatment. However, it was found that the regulatory mechanism of starch synthesis in the suspension cells cultured with abscisic acid was different from that in developing seeds. Expression analyses of genes involved in oil bodies, which accumulate in the embryo and aleurone layer, and seed storage proteins, which accumulate mainly in the endosperm, showed that the former were activated in the suspension cells cultured with abscisic acid, but the latter were not. Master regulators for embryogenesis, OsVP1 (homologue of AtABI3) and OsLFL1 (homologue of AtFUS3 or AtLFL2), were expressed in the suspension cells at levels comparable to those in the embryo. From these results, it is suggested that interactions between regulators and abscisic acid control the synthesis of phytic acid and oil bodies in the cultured cells and embryo. We suggest that the system of suspension cells cultured with abscisic acid helps to reveal the mechanisms of phytic acid and oil body synthesis in embryo.
25828772	Metabolic and transcriptomic signatures of rice floral organs reveal sugar starvation as a factor in reproductive failure under heat and drought stress.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Heat and drought stress are projected to become major challenges to sustain rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields with global climate change. Both stresses lead to yield losses when they coincide with flowering. A significant knowledge gap exists in the mechanistic understanding of the responses of rice floral organs that determine reproductive success under stress. Our work connects the metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in anthers, pistils before pollination and pollinated pistils in a heat-tolerant (N22) and a heat-sensitive (Moroberekan) cultivar. Systematic analysis of the floral organs revealed contrasts in metabolic profiles across anthers and pistils. Constitutive metabolic markers were identified that can define reproductive success in rice under stress. Six out of nine candidate metabolites identified by intersection analysis of stressed anthers were differentially accumulated in N22 compared with Moroberekan under non-stress conditions. Sugar metabolism was identified to be the crucial metabolic and transcriptional component that differentiated floral organ tolerance or susceptibility to stress. While susceptible Moroberekan specifically showed high expression of the Carbon Starved Anthers (CSA) gene under combined heat and drought, tolerant N22 responded with high expression of genes encoding a sugar transporter (MST8) and a cell wall invertase (INV4) as markers of high sink strength.
25780993	Priming effect of abscisic acid on alkaline stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Saline-alkaline stress is characterized by high salinity and high alkalinity (high pH); alkaline stress has been shown to be the primary factor inhibiting rice seedling growth. In this study, we investigated the potential priming effect of abscisic acid (ABA) on tolerance of rice seedlings to alkaline stress simulated by Na2CO3. Seedlings were pretreated with ABA at concentrations of 0 (control), 10, and 50 μM by root-drench for 24 h and then transferred to a Na2CO3 solution that did not contain ABA. Compared to control treatment, pretreatment with ABA substantially improved the survival rate of rice seedlings and increased biomass accumulation after 7 days under the alkaline condition. ABA application at 10 μM also alleviated the inhibitory effects of alkaline stress on the total root length and root surface area. Physiologically, ABA increased relative water content (RWC) and decreased cell membrane injury degree (MI) and Na(+)/K(+) ratios. In contrast, fluridone (an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor) decreased the RWC and increased MI in shoots under the alkaline conditions. These data suggest that ABA has a potent priming effect on the adaptive response to alkaline stress in rice and may be useful for improving rice growth in saline-alkaline paddy fields.
25754232	Transgenic expression of an unedited mitochondrial orfB gene product from wild abortive (WA) cytoplasm of rice (Oryza sativa L.) generates male sterility in fertile rice lines.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Over-expression of the unedited mitochondrial orfB gene product generates male sterility in fertile indica rice lines in a dose-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and nuclear-controlled fertility restoration are widespread developmental features in plant reproductive systems. In self-pollinated crop plants, these processes often provide useful tools to exploit hybrid vigour. The wild abortive CMS has been employed in the majority of the "three-line" hybrid rice production since 1970s. In the present study, we provide experimental evidence for a positive functional relationship between the 1.1-kb unedited orfB gene transcript, and its translated product in the mitochondria with male sterility. The generation of the 1.1-kb unedited orfB gene transcripts increased during flowering, resulting in low ATP synthase activity in sterile plants. Following insertion of the unedited orfB gene into the genome of male-fertile plants, the plants became male sterile in a dose-dependent manner with concomitant reduction of ATPase activity of F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Fertility of the transgenic lines and normal activity of ATP synthase were restored by down-regulation of the unedited orfB gene expression through RNAi-mediated silencing. The genetic elements deciphered in this study could further be tested for their use in hybrid rice development.
25817414	Spikelet-specific variation in ethylene production and constitutive expression of ethylene receptors and signal transducers during grain filling of compact- and lax-panicle rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Grain yields in modern super rice cultivars do not always meet the expectations because many spikelets are located on secondary branches in closely packed homogeneous distribution in these plants, and they do not fill properly. The factors limiting grain filling of such spikelets, especially in the lower panicle branches, are elusive. Two long-duration rice cultivars differing in panicle density, Mahalaxmi (compact) and Upahar (lax), were cultivated in an open field plot. Grain filling, ethylene production and constitutive expression of ethylene receptors and ethylene signal transducers in apical and basal spikelets of the panicle were compared during the early post-anthesis stage, which is the most critical period for grain development. In another experiment, a similar assessment was made for the medium-duration cultivars compact-panicle OR-1918 and lax-panicle Lalat. Grain weight of the apical spikelets was always higher than that of the basal spikelets. This gradient of grain weight was wide in the compact-panicle cultivars and narrow in the lax-panicle cultivars. Compared to apical spikelets, the basal spikelets produced more ethylene at anthesis and retained the capacity for post-anthesis expression of ethylene receptors and ethylene signal transducers longer. High ethylene production enhanced the expression of the RSR1 gene, but reduced expression of the GBSS1 gene. Ethylene inhibited the partitioning of assimilates of developing grains resulting in low starch biosynthesis and high accumulation of soluble carbohydrates. It is concluded that an increase in grain/spikelet density in rice panicles reduces apical dominance to the detriment of grain filling by production of ethylene and/or enhanced perception of the ethylene signal. Ethylene could be a second messenger for apical dominance in grain filling. The manipulation of the ethylene signal would possibly improve rice grain yield.
25815721	Rapid identification of major QTLs associated with rice grain weight and their utilization.	2015	PLoS One	To uncover the genetics of rice grain weight, we constructed an RIL population derived from a cross between a large grain accession M201 and a small size variety JY293. Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-Seq) technology was used to genotype two bulked DNA pools made from individual DNA of the heaviest 30 lines and the lightest 30 lines according to the 1000 grain weight (TGW). Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to identify SLAFs strongly associated with TGW. Two marker-intensive regions at 24,600,000-24,850,000 bp and 25,000,000-25,350,000 bp on chromosome 3 were identified tightly related to the TGW. Then a linkage map of chromosome 3 was constructed with SSR markers and some SLAF derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for TGW, grain length, grain width, and grain thickness revealed one major QTL in the second hot-region and two other minor QTLs for grain weight. These three QTLs displayed hierarchical effects on grain length and grain weight in order of qTGW3.2 (qGL3) qTGW3.1 (GS3) qTGW3.3. Multiple comparisons of means among the eight combinations of 3 QTLs revealed that the lines with two of three QTLs deriving from M201 displayed a large grain weight phenotype (TGW 40.2g, average data of three years) and lines with both qTGW3.1 and qTGW3.3 alleles from M201 (42.5g) had similar grain weight to the qTGW3.2 (40.8g) alone. Two strategies with similar effectiveness were proposed to improve grain weight by marker-assisted selection (MAS). One is to introduce the novel qTGW3.2 allele alone, and the other is to pyramid qTGW3.1 and qTGW3.3 alleles together. One new allele of GS3 (39 bp deletion in intron 1) and two SNPs in coding sequence of qGL3 identified in this study from M201 are useful in pyramiding elite alleles for molecular breeding for improvement of rice yield.
25809150	Unique miRNome during anthesis in drought-tolerant indica rice var. Nagina 22.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Drought-tolerant rice variety, Nagina 22 (N22), has a unique spikelet miRNome during anthesis stage drought as well as transition from heading to anthesis. Molecular characterization of genetic diversity of rice is essential to understand the evolution and molecular basis of various agronomically important traits such as drought tolerance. miRNAs play an important role in regulating plant development as well as stress response such as drought. In this study, we characterized the yet unexplored dynamics of the spikelet miRNA population during developmental transition from 'heading' to 'anthesis' as well as anthesis stage drought stress in a drought-tolerant indica rice variety, N22. A significant proportion of miRNA population (~20 %) in N22 spikelets is modulated during transition from heading to anthesis indicating a unique miRNome at anthesis, a developmental stage highly sensitive to stress (drought/heat). Based on the analysis of degradome data, majority of differentially regulated miRNAs appear to regulate transcription factors, some of which are implicated in regulation of development and fertilization. Similarly, drought during anthesis leads to a global change in miRNA expression pattern including those which regulate ROS homeostasis. It was possible to identify several miRNAs that were not reported to be drought responsive in earlier studies. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the drought-regulated miRNAs co-localize within QTLs related to drought tolerance and associated traits. Comparison of the expression profiles between N22 and Pusa Basmati 1 (drought sensitive) identified miRNAs with variety-specific expression patterns during phase transition (miR164, miR396, miR812, and miR1881) as well as drought stress (miR1881) indicating an evolution of a distinct and variety-specific regulatory mechanism. The promoters of these miRNAs contain LREs (light-responsive elements) and are induced by dark treatment. It was also possible to identify 4 novel miRNAs including an intronic miRNA that was conserved in both rice varieties.
25886904	Global epigenomic analysis indicates that epialleles contribute to Allele-specific expression via Allele-specific histone modifications in hybrid rice.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: For heterozygous genes, alleles on the chromatin from two different parents exhibit histone modification variations known as allele-specific histone modifications (ASHMs). The regulation of allele-specific gene expression (ASE) by ASHMs has been reported in animals. However, to date, the regulation of ASE by ASHM genes remains poorly understood in higher plants.

RESULTS: We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the global ASHM profiles of trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) in two rice F1 hybrids. A total of 522 to 550 allele-specific H3K27me3 genes and 428 to 494 allele-specific H3K36me3 genes were detected in GL × 93-11 and GL × TQ, accounting for 11.09% and 26.13% of the total analyzed genes, respectively. The epialleles between parents were highly related to ASHMs. Further analysis indicated that 52.48% to 70.40% of the epialleles were faithfully inherited by the F1 hybrid and contributed to 33.18% to 46.55% of the ASHM genes. Importantly, 66.67% to 82.69% of monoallelic expression genes contained the H3K36me3 modification. Further studies demonstrated a significant positive correlation of ASE with allele-specific H3K36me3 but not with H3K27me3, indicating that ASHM-H3K36me3 primarily regulates ASE in this study.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that epialleles from parents can be inherited by the F1 to produce ASHMs in the F1 hybrid. Our findings indicate that ASHM-H3K36me3, rather than H3K27me3, mainly regulates ASE in hybrid rice.
25846877	Identification of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene family in winter wheat and expression analysis under conditions of freezing stress.	2015	J Genet	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Trehalose contents are potentially modulated by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), which is a key enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway. Using available wheat expressed sequence tag sequence information from NCBI and two wheat genome databases, we identified 12 wheat TPS genes and performed a comprehensive study on their structural, evolutionary and functional properties. The estimated divergence time of wheat TPS gene pairs and wheat-rice orthologues suggested that wheat and rice have a common ancestor. The number of TPS genes in the wheat genome was estimated to be at least 12, which is close to the number found in rice, Arabidopsis and soybean. Moreover, it has been reported earlier in other plants that TPS genes respond to abiotic stress, however, our study mainly analysed the TPS gene family under freezing conditions in winter wheat, and determined that most of the TPS gene expression in winter wheat was induced by freezing conditions, which further suggested that wheat TPS genes were involved in winter wheat freeze-resistance signal transduction pathways. Taken together, the current study represents the first comprehensive study of TPS genes in winter wheat and provides a foundation for future functional studies of this important gene family in Triticeae.
25821195	Quantitative trait locus analysis and fine mapping of the qPL6 locus for panicle length in rice.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Two QTLs were identified to control panicle length in rice backcross lines, and one QTL qPL6 was finely mapped with potential in high yield breeding. Panicle length (PL) is the key determinant of panicle architecture in rice, and strongly affects yield components, such as grain number per panicle. However, this trait has not been well studied genetically nor its contribution to yield improvement. In this study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for PL in four backcross populations derived from the cross of Nipponbare (japonica) and WS3 (indica), a new plant type (NPT) variety. Two QTLs were identified on chromosome 6 and 8, designated as qPL6 and qPL8, respectively. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed to evaluate their contribution to important agronomic traits. We found that qPL6 and qPL8 had additive effects on PL trait. For the qPL6 locus, the WS3 allele also increased panicle primary and secondary branches and grain number per panicle. Moreover, this allele conferred wide and strong culms, a character of lodging resistance. By analyzing key recombinants in two steps, the qPL6 locus was finely mapped to a 25-kb interval, and 3 candidate genes were identified. According to the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes, 5 dCaps markers were designed and used to get haplotypes of 96 modern Chinese varieties, which proved that qPL6 locus is differentiated between indica and temperate japonica varieties. Taken together, the superior qPL6 allele can be applied in rice breeding programs for large sink size, particularly for japonica varieties that originally lack the allele.
25791479	Expression of the moss PpLEA4-20 gene in rice enhances membrane protection and client proteins stability.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Green vegetative tissues of the moss Physcomitrella patens possess a powerful ability to tolerate severe drought stress. Proteomics analysis have revealed that a large number of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins were key players in the drought tolerance of the photosynthetic tissues. PpLEA4-20, a member of the moss LEA protein family, was selected for further function study using an ectopic expression method in rice. Through molecular identification via PCR, southern blotting and TAIL-PCR, we demonstrated that the PpLEA4-20 gene was transformed and inserted into a non-encoded region in chromosome 4 of rice and expressed stably in transgenic rice. Unexpectedly, PpLEA4-20 protein emerged as two high-expressed spots on 2-D gels generated from transgenic rice, suggesting that PpLEA4-20 proteins are complete compatible and might be modified in rice. Both growth and physiological analysis showed that seedlings of transgenic PpLEA4-20 rice displayed altered phenotypes and tolerance to salt. In addition, electrolyte leakage was reduced in transgenic PpLEA4-20 compared to wild type under stress conditions. Anti-aggregation analysis found that the PpLEA4-20 protein expressed in rice remained soluble at high temperature and in addition to some native proteins from transgenic PpLEA4-20 rice. Based on Nano LC MS/MS analysis, we identified several proteins from transgenic PpLEA4-20 rice of increased heat-stability. Our results provide evidence for a role of PpLEA4-20 in salt tolerance and stabilization of client proteins.
25809149	The activities of four constitutively expressed promoters in single-copy transgenic rice plants for two homozygous generations.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: We have characterized four novel constitutive promoters ARP1, H3F3, HSP and H2BF3 that are active in all tissues/stages of transgenic plants and stable over two homozygous generations. Gene promoters that are active and stable over several generations in transgenic plants are valuable tools for plant research and biotechnology. In this study, we characterized four putative constitutive promoters (ARP1, H3F3, HSP and H2BF3) in transgenic rice plants. Promoter regions were fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene and transformed into rice. Single-copy transgenic lines were then selected and promoter activity was analyzed in various organs and tissues of two successive homozygous generations. All four promoters showed a broad expression profile in most tissues and developmental stages, and indeed the expression of the ARP1 and H3F3 promoters was even greater than that of the PGD1 promoter, a previously described constitutive promoter that has been used in transgenic rice. This observation was based on expression levels in leaves, roots, dry seeds and flowers in both the T2 and T3 generations. Each promoter exhibited comparable levels of activity over two homozygous generations with no sign of transgene silencing, which is an important characteristic of promoters to be used in crop biotechnology applications. These promoters therefore have considerable potential value for the stable and constitutive expression of transgenes in monocotyledonous crops.
25754973	Brassinosteroids promote development of rice pollen grains and seeds by triggering expression of Carbon Starved Anther, a MYB domain protein.	2015	Plant J	Transport of photoassimilates from leaf tissues (source regions) to the sink organs is essential for plant development. Here, we show that a phytohormone, the brassinosteroids (BRs) promotes pollen and seed development in rice by directly promoting expression of Carbon Starved Anther (CSA) which encodes a MYB domain protein. Over-expression of the BR-synthesis gene D11 or a BR-signaling factor OsBZR1 results in higher sugar accumulation in developing anthers and seeds, as well as higher grain yield compared with control non-transgenic plants. Conversely, knockdown of D11 or OsBZR1 expression causes defective pollen maturation and reduced seed size and weight, with less accumulation of starch in comparison with the control. Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development. These findings provide insight into how BRs enhance plant reproduction and grain yield in an important agricultural crop.
25815594	In silico analysis of the genes encoding proteins that are involved in the biosynthesis of the RMS/MAX/D pathway revealed new roles of Strigolactones in plants.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Strigolactones were described as a new group of phytohormones in 2008 and since then notable large number of their functions has been uncovered, including the regulation of plant growth and development, interactions with other organisms and a plant's response to different abiotic stresses. In the last year, investigations of the strigolactone biosynthesis pathway in two model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, resulted in great progress in understanding the functions of four enzymes that are involved in this process. We performed in silico analyses, including the identification of the cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of genes encoding proteins of the strigolactone biosynthesis pathway and the identification of the miRNAs that are able to regulate their posttranscriptional level. We also searched the databases that contain the microarray data for the genes that were analyzed from both species in order to check their expression level under different growth conditions. The results that were obtained indicate that there are universal regulations of expression of all of the genes that are involved in the strigolactone biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and rice, but on the other hand each stage of strigolactone production may be additionally regulated independently. This work indicates the presence of crosstalk between strigolactones and almost all of the other phytohormones and suggests the role of strigolactones in the response to abiotic stresses, such as wounding, cold or flooding, as well as in the response to biotic stresses.
25728912	Molecular cloning of melatonin 2-hydroxylase responsible for 2-hydroxymelatonin production in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	J Pineal Res	Although melatonin biosynthetic genes from plants have been cloned, the melatonin catabolism mechanisms remain unclear. To clone the genes responsible for melatonin metabolism, we ectopically expressed 35 full-length cDNAs of rice 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD) in Escherichia coli and purified the corresponding recombinant proteins. In vitro 2-ODD assays showed four independent 2-ODD proteins that were able to catalyze melatonin into 2-hydroxymelatonin, exhibiting melatonin 2-hydroxylase (M2H). These M2H proteins had peak activities at pH 8.0 and 30°C. The Km ranged from 121 μm to 371 μm with the Vmax ranging from 1.7 to 18.5 pkat/mg protein, respectively. The M2H enzyme activities were dependent on cofactors such as α-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe(2+), similar to the 2-ODD enzymes. M2H activity was inhibited by prohexadione-Ca, an inhibitor of 2-ODD, in a dose-dependent manner. M2H activity was high in the roots of rice seedlings, concurrent with high transcription levels of 2-ODD 21, suggesting that 2-ODD 21 was a major gene for M2H activity. Analogous to the high M2H activity in the roots, 2-hydroxymelatonin was found in large quantities in roots treated with melatonin. These results suggest that melatonin was metabolized into 2-hydroxymelatonin by the M2H genes in plants, but the physiological significance of 2-hydroxymelatonin remains to be examined in the future.
25732533	Loss of floral repressor function adapts rice to higher latitudes in Europe.	2015	J Exp Bot	The capacity to discriminate variations in day length allows plants to align flowering with the most favourable season of the year. This capacity has been altered by artificial selection when cultivated varieties became adapted to environments different from those of initial domestication. Rice flowering is promoted by short days when HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1) and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1) induce the expression of florigenic proteins encoded by HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1). Repressors of flowering antagonize such induction under long days, maintaining vegetative growth and delaying flowering. To what extent artificial selection of long day repressor loci has contributed to expand rice cultivation to Europe is currently unclear. This study demonstrates that European varieties activate both Hd3a and RFT1 expression regardless of day length and their induction is caused by loss-of-function mutations at major long day floral repressors. However, their contribution to flowering time control varies between locations. Pyramiding of mutations is frequently observed in European germplasm, but single mutations are sufficient to adapt rice to flower at higher latitudes. Expression of Ehd1 is increased in varieties showing reduced or null Hd1 expression under natural long days, as well as in single hd1 mutants in isogenic backgrounds. These data indicate that loss of repressor genes has been a key strategy to expand rice cultivation to Europe, and that Ehd1 is a central node integrating floral repressive signals.
25824104	Gene targeting by the TAL effector PthXo2 reveals cryptic resistance gene for bacterial blight of rice.	2015	Plant J	Bacterial blight of rice is caused by the γ-proteobacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which utilizes a group of type III TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors to induce host gene expression and condition host susceptibility. Five SWEET genes are functionally redundant to support bacterial disease, but only two were experimentally proven targets of natural TAL effectors. Here, we report the identification of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET13 as the disease-susceptibility gene for PthXo2 and the existence of cryptic recessive resistance to PthXo2-dependent X. oryzae pv. oryzae due to promoter variations of OsSWEET13 in japonica rice. PthXo2-containing strains induce OsSWEET13 in indica rice IR24 due to the presence of an unpredicted and undescribed effector binding site not present in the alleles in japonica rice Nipponbare and Kitaake. The specificity of effector-associated gene induction and disease susceptibility is attributable to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is also found in a polymorphic allele of OsSWEET13 known as the recessive resistance gene xa25 from the rice cultivar Minghui 63. The mutation of OsSWEET13 with CRISPR/Cas9 technology further corroborates the requirement of OsSWEET13 expression for the state of PthXo2-dependent disease susceptibility to X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Gene profiling of a collection of 104 strains revealed OsSWEET13 induction by 42 isolates of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Heterologous expression of OsSWEET13 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells elevates sucrose concentrations in the apoplasm. The results corroborate a model whereby X. oryzae pv. oryzae enhances the release of sucrose from host cells in order to exploit the host resources.
25867379	Cloning and characterization of peanut allene oxide cyclase gene involved in salt-stressed responses.	2015	Genet Mol Res	In this study, the full-length cDNA encoding allene oxide cyclase (AhAOC) was isolated from peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). The deduced amino acid sequence of AhAOC showed high homology with other plant AOCs. The transcript of AhAOC was found to be abundantly expressed in roots. Expression analysis demonstrated that AhAOC was induced by abscisic acid, methyl-jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, salinity, polyethylene glycol, and cold stresses, particularly by high salinity. Overexpression of AhAOC in rice increased root elongation and plant height compared with expression in control plants and conferred tolerance against salinity. Thus, the AhAOC gene may play an important role in increasing the expression of transcription factors (MYB2 and OsONAC045) and functional genes (DREB1F and LEA3) in transgenic rice under salt stress as well as improve stress tolerance through the accumulation of compatible solutes (proline and soluble sugar). The AhAOC gene is a potential resource for enhancing salt tolerance in crop species.
25768901	Cold tolerance encoded in one SNP.	2015	Cell	Cold tolerance fundamentally affects world crop harvest. Ma et al. now identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a gene called COLD1 that confers cold tolerance in japonica rice. This study reveals important insights into agronomical traits that are essential for human nutrition.

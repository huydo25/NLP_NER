21521743	A role for the cysteine-rich 10 kDa prolamin in protein body I formation in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice prolamins consist of cysteine-rich 10 kDa (CysR10), 14 kDa (CysR14) and 16 kDa (CysR16) molecular species and a cysteine-poor 13 kDa (CysP13) polypeptide. These storage proteins form protein bodies (PBs) composed of single spherical intracisternal inclusions assembled within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that CysR10 and CysP13 were asymmetrically distributed within the PBs, with the former concentrated at the electron-dense center core region and the latter distributed mainly to the electron-lucent peripheral region. These results together with temporal expression data showed that the formation of prolamin-containing PB-I in the wild-type endosperm was initiated by the accumulation of CysR10 to form the center core. In mutants deficient for cysteine-rich prolamins, the typical PB-I structures containing the electron-dense center core were not observed, and instead were replaced by irregularly shaped, electron-lucent, hypertrophied PBs. Similar, deformed PBs were observed in a CysR10 RNA interference plant line. These results suggest that CysR10, through its formation of the central core and its possible interaction with other cysteine-rich prolamins, is required for tight packaging of the proteins into a compact spherical structure.
21205187	Rice phospholipase Dα is involved in salt tolerance by the mediation of H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Phospholipase Dα (PLDα) is involved in plant response to salt stress, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated rice PLDα (OsPLDα) localization and its effect on tonoplast (TP) and plasma membrane (PM) H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription in response to NaCl. When rice suspension-cultured cells were treated with 100 mM NaCl, PLDα activity in cell extracts showed a transient activation with a threefold increase at 1 h. The amount of OsPLDα protein decreased slightly in the cytosolic fractions, whereas it increased significantly in the TP after NaCl treatment. OsPLDα1 knockdown cells were developed using RNA interference (RNAi) methods. The increase in TP and PM H(+)-ATPase activity induced by NaCl was significantly inhibited in OsPLDα1-RNAi cells. Knockdown of OsPLDα1 prevented the NaCl-induced increase in the transcript level of OsVHA-A (encodes TP H(+)-ATPase) and OSA2 (encodes PM H(+)-ATPase), as well as OsNHX1 (encodes TP Na(+) /H(+) antiporter). The cells died more in OsPLDα1-RNAi mutant than in wild type when they were treated with NaCl. These results suggest that OsPLDα is involved in salt tolerance in rice through the mediation of H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription.
21645201	Discovery of polymorphisms in starch-related genes in rice germplasm by amplification of pooled DNA and deeply parallel sequencing.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	High-throughput sequencing of pooled DNA was applied to polymorphism discovery in candidate genes involved in starch synthesis. This approach employed semi- to long-range PCR (LR-PCR) followed by next-generation sequencing technology. A total of 17 rice starch synthesis genes encoding seven classes of enzymes, including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granule starch synthase (GBSS), soluble starch synthase (SS), starch branching enzyme (BE), starch debranching enzyme (DBE) and starch phosphorylase (SPHOL) and phosphate translocator (GPT1) from 233 genotypes were PCR amplified using semi- to long-range PCR. The amplification products were equimolarly pooled and sequenced using massively parallel sequencing technology (MPS). By detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/Indels in both coding and noncoding areas of the genes, we identified genetic differences and characterized the SNP/Indel variation and distribution patterns among individual starch candidate genes. Approximately, 60.9 million reads were generated, of which 54.8 million (90%) mapped to the reference sequences. The average coverage rate ranged from 12,708 to 38,300 times for SSIIa and SSIIIb, respectively. SNPs and single/multiple-base Indels were analysed in a total assembled length of 116,403 bp. In total, 501 SNPs and 113 Indels were detected across the 17 starch-related loci. The ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous SNPs (Ka/Ks) test indicated GBSSI and isoamylase 1 (ISA1) as the least diversified (most purified) and conservative genes as the studied populations have been through cycles of selection. This report demonstrates a useful strategy for screening germplasm by MPS to discover variants in a specific target group of genes.
21410288	The hypocholesterolemic activity of transgenic rice seed accumulating lactostatin, a bioactive peptide derived from bovine milk β-lactoglobulin.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	Lactostatin is a novel pentapeptide (IIAEK) derived from bovine milk β-lactoglobulin with greater hypocholesterolemic activity than β-sitosterol, the drug commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia. We developed transgenic rice expressing lactostatin as a fusion protein with seed storage protein (SSP) glutelins under the control of three different endosperm-specific promoters. Lactostatin accumulated in transgenic rice seed at approximately 1.6 mg/g seeds (dry seeds) without any apparent influence on seed traits such as endogenous SSP expression levels or alterations in the intracellular structures of endosperm cells. Short-term (three day) oral administration of the glutelin fraction containing lactostatin (namely three times of 300 mg/kg body weight/day) extracted from transgenic rice seeds resulted in hypocholesterolemic activity in rats; namely, the serum low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was significantly reduced accompanied by a significant increase in beneficial serum high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
21527628	Overexpression of a Harpin-encoding gene hrf1 in rice enhances drought tolerance.	2011	J Exp Bot	Harpin proteins are well known as eliciters that induce multiple responses in plants, such as systemic acquired resistance, hypersensitive response, enhancement of growth, resistance to the green peach aphid, and tolerance to drought. Overexpression of Harpin-encoding genes enhances plant resistance to diseases in tobacco, rice, rape, and cotton; however, it is not yet known whether the expression of Harpin-encoding genes in vivo improves plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. The results of this study showed that overexpression of a Harpin-encoding gene hrf1 in rice increased drought tolerance through abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. hrf1- overexpression induces an increase in ABA content and promotes stomatal closure in rice. The hrf1 transgenic rice lines exhibited a significant increase in water retention ability, levels of free proline and soluble sugars, tolerance to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability, and expression levels of four stress-related genes, OsLEA3-1, OsP5CS, Mn-SOD, and NM_001074345, under drought stress. The study confirmed that hrf1 conferred enhanced tolerance to drought stress on transgenic crops. These results suggest that Harpins may offer new opportunities for generating drought resistance in other crops.
21490163	High-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry reveals the contrasting subcellular distribution of arsenic and silicon in rice roots.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) takes up arsenite mainly through the silicic acid transport pathway. Understanding the uptake and sequestration of arsenic (As) into the rice plant is important for developing strategies to reduce As concentration in rice grain. In this study, the cellular and subcellular distributions of As and silicon (Si) in rice roots were investigated using high-pressure freezing, high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Rice plants, both the lsi2 mutant lacking the Si/arsenite efflux transporter Lsi2 and its wild-type cultivar, with or without an iron plaque, were treated with arsenate or arsenite. The formation of iron plaque on the root surface resulted in strong accumulation of As and phosphorous on the epidermis. The lsi2 mutant showed stronger As accumulation in the endodermal vacuoles, where the Lsi2 transporter is located in the plasma membranes, than the wild-type line. As also accumulated in the vacuoles of some xylem parenchyma cells and in some pericycle cells, particularly in the wild-type mature root zone. Vacuolar accumulation of As is associated with sulfur, suggesting that As may be stored as arsenite-phytochelatin complexes. Si was localized in the cell walls of the endodermal cells with little apparent effect of the Lsi2 mutation on its distribution. This study reveals the vacuolar sequestration of As in rice roots and contrasting patterns of As and Si subcellular localization, despite both being transported across the plasma membranes by the same transporters.
21501886	Inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae induces thylakoid membrane association of Rubisco activase in Oryza meyeriana.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Oryza meyeriana is a wild species of rice with high resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), but the resistance mechanism is poorly understood. Protein gel blot analysis and immuno-gold electron microscopy showed that Xoo infection induced an association of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase (RCA) with the thylakoid membrane in O. meyeriana, which led to considerable decline in the initial activity and the activation state of Rubisco. In susceptible cultivated rice, RCA remained in the chloroplast stroma. RCA may play a role in resistance to Xoo in O. meyeriana that differs from its well-known role in activating Rubisco, perhaps by protecting the thylakoid membrane against damage from Xoo.
21596949	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Leaf rolling is considered an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling. The phenotypes were caused by knockout of Rice outermost cell-specific gene5 (Roc5), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene GLABRA2. Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling. Bulliform cell number and size increased in oul1 and Roc5 cosuppression plants but were reduced in Roc5-overexpressing lines. The data indicate that Roc5 negatively regulates bulliform cell fate and development. Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1. The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function. These are, to our knowledge, the first functional data for a gene encoding a homeodomain leucine zipper class IV transcriptional factor in rice that modulates leaf rolling.
21274561	Visualisation of stromules in transgenic wheat expressing a plastid-targeted yellow fluorescent protein.	2011	Planta	Stromules are stroma-filled tubules that extend from the plastids in all multicellular plants examined to date. To facilitate the visualisation of stromules on different plastid types in various tissues of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a chimeric gene construct encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) targeted to plastids with the transit peptide of wheat granule-bound starch synthase I was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The gene construct was under the control of the rice Actin1 promoter, and EYFP fluorescence was detected in plastids in all cell types throughout the transgenic plants. Stromules were observed on all plastid types, although the stromule length and abundance varied markedly in different tissues. The longest stromules (up to 40 μm) were observed in epidermal cells of leaves, whereas only short beak-like stromules were observed on chloroplasts in mesophyll cells. Epidermal cells in leaves and roots contained the highest proportion of plastids with stromules, and stromules were also abundant on amyloplasts in the endosperm tissue of developing seeds. The general features of stromule morphology and distribution were similar to those shown previously for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.).
21638061	Cloning and characterization of a maize SnRK2 protein kinase gene confers enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	SnRK2 (sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinases 2) represents a unique family of protein kinase in regulating signaling transduction in plants. Although the regulatory mechanisms of SnRK2 have been well demonstrated in Arabidopsis thaliana, their functions in maize are still unknown. In our study, we cloned an SnRK2 gene from maize, ZmSAPK8, which encoded a putative homolog of the rice SAPK8 protein. ZmSAPK8 had two copies in the maize genome and harbored eight introns in its coding region. We demonstrated that ZmSAPK8 expressed differentially in various organs of maize plants and was up-regulated by high-salinity and drought treatment. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ZmSAPK8 showed subcellular localization in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. In vitro kinase assays indicated that ZmSAPK8 preferred Mn(2+) to Mg(2+) as cofactor for phosphorylation, and Ser-182 and Thr-183 in activation loop was important for its activity. Heterologous overexpression of ZmSAPK8 in Arabidopsis could significantly strengthen tolerance to salt stress. Under salt treatment, ZmSAPK8-overexpressed transgenic plants exhibited higher germination rate and proline content, low electrolyte leakage and higher survival rate than wild type. Further analysis indicated that transgenic plants showed increased transcription of the stress-related genes, RD29A, RD29B, RAB18, ABI1, DREB2A and P5CS1, under high-salinity conditions. The results demonstrated that ZmSAPK8 was involved in diverse stress signal transduction. Moreover, no obvious adverse effects on growth and development in the ZmSAPK8-overexpressed transgenic plants implied that ZmSAPK8 was potentially useful in transgenic breeding to improve salt tolerance in crops.
21518249	Identification of a stable quantitative trait locus for percentage grains with white chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	High chalkiness is a major problem in many rice-producing areas of the world, especially in hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China. We previously showed a major quantitative trait locus for the percentage of grains with white chalkiness (QTLqPGWC-8) in the interval G1149-R727 on chromosome 8 using a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL). Here, we selected the line-CSSL50 harboring the QTLqPGWC-8 allele from the CSSLs derived from a cross between Asominori (as a recurrent parent) and IR24 (as a donor parent), which had higher percentage chalkiness, markedly different from that of Asominori. There were also significant differences in starch granules, appearance of amylose content (AAC) and milling qualities between Asominori and CSSL50, but not in grain size or thousand grain weight (TGW). The BC(4) F(2) and BC(4) F(3) populations from a cross between CSSL50 and Asominori were used for fine mapping of qPGWC-8. We narrowed down the location of this QTL to a 142 kb region between Indel markers 8G-7 and 8G-9. QTLqPGWC-8 accounted for 50.9% of the difference in PGWC between the parents. The markers tightly linked to qPGWC-8 should facilitate cloning of the gene underlying this QTL and will be of value for marker-assisted selection in breeding rice varieties with better grain quality.
21540434	BARREN STALK FASTIGIATE1 is an AT-hook protein required for the formation of maize ears.	2011	Plant Cell	Ears are the seed-bearing inflorescences of maize (Zea mays) plants and represent a crucial component of maize yield. The first step in the formation of ears is the initiation of axillary meristems in the axils of developing leaves. In the classic maize mutant barren stalk fastigiate1 (baf1), first discovered in the 1950s, ears either do not form or, if they do, are partially fused to the main stalk. We positionally cloned Baf1 and found that it encodes a transcriptional regulator containing an AT-hook DNA binding motif. Single coorthologs of Baf1 are found in syntenic regions of brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon), rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), suggesting that the gene is likely present in all cereal species. Protein-protein interaction assays suggest that BAF1 is capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the AT-hook family. Another transcriptional regulator required for ear initiation is the basic helix-loop-helix protein BARREN STALK1 (BA1). Genetic and expression analyses suggest that Baf1 is required to reach a threshold level of Ba1 expression for the initiation of maize ears. We propose that Baf1 functions in the demarcation of a boundary region essential for the specification of a stem cell niche.
21443632	A P450-centric view of plant evolution.	2011	Plant J	Being by far the largest family of enzymes to support plant metabolism, the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) constitute an excellent reporter of metabolism architecture and evolution. The huge superfamily of CYPs found in angiosperms is built on the successful evolution of 11 ancestral genes, with very different fates and progenies. Essential functions in the production of structural components (membrane sterols), light harvesting (carotenoids) or hormone biosynthesis kept some of them under purifying selection, limiting duplication and sub/neofunctionalization. One group (the CYP71 clan) after an early trigger to diversification, has kept growing, producing bursts of gene duplications at an accelerated rate. The CYP71 clan now represents more than half of all CYPs in higher plants. Such bursts of gene duplication are likely to contribute to adaptation to specific niches and to speciation. They also occur, although with lower frequency, in gene families under purifying selection. The CYP complement (CYPomes) of rice and the model grass weed Brachypodium distachyon have been compared to view evolution in a narrower time window. The results show that evolution of new functions in plant metabolism is a very long-term process. Comparative analysis of the plant CYPomes provides information on the successive steps required for the evolution of land plants, and points to several cases of convergent evolution in plant metabolism. It constitutes a very useful tool for spotting essential functions in plant metabolism and to guide investigations on gene function.
21493745	The rice RMR1 associates with a distinct prevacuolar compartment for the protein storage vacuole pathway.	2011	Mol Plant	Transport of vacuolar proteins from Golgi apparatus or trans-Golgi network (TGN) to vacuoles is a receptor-mediated process via an intermediate membrane-bound prevacuolar compartment (PVC) in plant cells. Both vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) and receptor homology region-transmembrane domain-RING-H2 (RMR) proteins have been shown to function in transporting storage proteins to protein storage vacuole (PSV), but little is known about the nature of the PVC for the PSV pathway. Here, we use the rice RMR1 (OsRMR1) as a probe to study the PSV pathway in plants. Immunogold electron microscopy (EM) with specific OsRMR1 antibodies showed that OsRMR1 proteins were found in the Golgi apparatus, TGN, and a distinct organelle with characteristics of PVC in both rice culture cells and developing rice seeds, as well as the protein body type II (PBII) or PSV in developing rice seeds. This organelle, also found in both tobacco BY-2 and Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells, is morphologically distinct from the VSR-positive multivesicular lytic PVC or multivesicular body (MVB) and thus represent a PVC for the PSV pathway that we name storage PVC (sPVC). Further in vivo and in vitro interaction studies using truncated OsRMR1 proteins secreted into the culture media of transgenic BY-2 suspension cells demonstrated that OsRMR1 functions as a sorting receptor in transporting vicilin-like storage proteins.
21294842	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a novel semidominant dwarfing gene LB4D in rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	A dwarf mutant, designated LB4D, was obtained among the progeny of backcrosses to a wild rice introgression line. Genetic analysis of LB4D indicated that the dwarf phenotype was controlled by a single semidominant dwarfing gene, which was named LB4D. The mutants were categorized as dn-type dwarf mutants according to the pattern of internode reduction. In addition, gibberellin (GA) response tests showed that LB4D plants were neither deficient nor insensitive to GA. This study found that tiller formation by LB4D plants was decreased by 40% compared with the wild type, in contrast to other dominant dwarf mutants that have been identified, indicating that a different dwarfing mechanism might be involved in the LB4D dominant mutant. The reduction of plant height in F(1) plants ranged from 27.9% to 38.1% in different genetic backgrounds, showing that LB4D exerted a stronger dominant dwarfing effect. Using large F(2) and F(3) populations derived from a cross between heterozygous LB4D and the japonica cultivar Nipponbare, the LB4D gene was localized to a 46 kb region between the markers Indel 4 and Indel G on the short arm of chromosome 11, and four predicted genes were identified as candidates in the target region.
20978084	OsCAND1 is required for crown root emergence in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	Crown roots are main components of the fibrous root system and important for crops to anchor and absorb water and nutrition. To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND1). The defect of visible crown root in the Oscand1 mutant is the result of cessation of the G2/M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem. Map-based cloning revealed that OsCAND1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis CAND1. During crown root primordium development, the expression of OsCAND1 is confined to the root cap after the establishment of fundamental organization. The transgenic plants harboring DR5::GUS showed that auxin signaling in crown root tip is abnormal in the mutant. Exogenous auxin application can partially rescue the defect of crown root development in Oscand1. Taken together, these data show that OsCAND1 is involved in auxin signaling to maintain the G2/M cell cycle transition in crown root meristem and, consequently, the emergence of crown root. Our findings provide new information about the molecular regulation of the emergence of crown root in rice.
21502187	Identification of a cis-acting element of ART1, a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor for aluminum tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most aluminum (Al)-tolerant species among small-grain cereals. Recent identification of a transcription factor AL RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1) revealed that this high Al tolerance in rice is achieved by multiple genes involved in detoxification of Al at different cellular levels. ART1 is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor and regulates the expression of 31 genes in the downstream. In this study, we attempted to identify a cis-acting element of ART1. We used the promoter region of SENSITIVE TO AL RHIZOTOXICITY1, an Al tolerance gene in the downstream of ART1. With the help of gel-shift assay, we were able to identify the cis-acting element as GGN(T/g/a/C)V(C/A/g)S(C/G). This element was found in the promoter region of 29 genes among 31 ART1-regulated genes. To confirm this cis-acting element in vivo, we transiently introduced this element one or five times tandemly repeated sequence with 35S minimal promoter and green fluorescent protein reporter together with or without ART1 gene in the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll protoplasts. The results showed that the expression of green fluorescent protein reporter responded to ART1 expression. Furthermore, the expression increased with repetition of the cis-acting element. Our results indicate that the five nucleotides identified are the target DNA-binding sequence of ART1.
21573806	Rice develop wavy seminal roots in response to light stimulus.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seminal roots are the primary roots to emerge from germinated seeds. Here, we demonstrate that the photomorphology of the seminal roots was diverse among rice varieties, and the light-induced wavy roots were found mostly in indica-type rice varieties. The light-induced wavy morphology in rice seminal roots has been different with curling or coiling roots in some other specific conditions, such as high air humidity or high nitrogen nutrient. The efficiency of light-induced root waving was developmental stage dependent. The wavy root phenotype was caused by asymmetric cell growth around the stele. Using the inhibitors to block auxin polar transport and fatty acid oxygenation, the role of auxin and oxylipins in the morphogenesis of light-induced wavy roots was investigated. Expressions of genes encoded in the enzymes involved in fatty acid oxygenation in light-exposed roots were monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results suggested that auxin polar transport was essential for inducing wavy seminal roots by light stimulus. In addition, the ketol oxylipins derived from allene oxide synthase (EC 4.2.1.92)-mediated fatty acid oxygenation function as intracellular signals for triggering the light-induced wavy root phenotype.
21467577	Rice APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 coupled with two DEAD-box adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent RNA helicases regulates tapetum degeneration.	2011	Plant Cell	Programmed cell death (PCD) during tapetum degeneration in postmeiotic anthers is critical for the proper development of male gametophytes in flowering plants. Although several genes involved in this process have been identified recently, the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we show that knockout of rice (Oryza sativa) APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 (API5), which encodes a putative homolog of antiapoptosis protein Api5 in animals, results in delayed degeneration of the tapetum due to inhibition of the tapetal PCD process leading to defects in formation of male gametophytes. Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases, API5-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2. AIP1 and AIP2 are homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Suppressor of Bad Response to Refrigeration1 protein 2 (SUB2p) that have critical roles in transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing. Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene. Suppression of Os AIP1/2 leads to down-regulation of CP1, resulting in sterility, which is highly similar to the effects of suppressed expression of Os CP1. Our results uncover a previously unknown pathway for regulating PCD during tapetum degeneration in rice, one that may be conserved among eukaryotic organisms.
20882959	Phytomonitoring and phytoremediation of agrochemicals and related compounds based on recombinant cytochrome P450s and aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs).	2011	J Agric Food Chem	Molecular mechanisms of metabolism and modes of actions of agrochemicals and related compounds are important for understanding selective toxicity, biodegradability, and monitoring of biological effects on nontarget organisms. It is well-known that in mammals, cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) monooxygenases metabolize lipophilic foreign compounds. These P450 species are inducible, and both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are induced by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) combined with a ligand. Gene engineering of P450 and NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (P450 reductase) was established for bioconversion. Also, gene modification of AhRs was developed for recombinant AhR-mediated β-glucronidase (GUS) reporter assay of AhR ligands. Recombinant P450 genes were transformed into plants for phytoremediation, and recombinant AhR-mediated GUS reporter gene expression systems were each transformed into plants for phytomonitoring. Transgenic rice plants carrying CYP2B6 metabolized the herbicide metolachlor and remarkably reduced the residues in the plants and soils under paddy field conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying recombinant guinea pig (g) AhR-mediated GUS reporter genes detected PCB126 at the level of 10 ng/g soils in the presence of biosurfactants MEL-B. Both phytomonitoring and phytoremediation plants were each evaluated from the standpoint of practical uses.
21689368	Global and grain-specific accumulation of glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanases in transgenic maize (Zea mays).	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	In planta expression of cell wall degrading enzymes is a promising approach for developing optimized biomass feedstocks that enable low-cost cellulosic biofuels production. Transgenic plants could serve as either an enzyme source for the hydrolysis of pretreated biomass or as the primary biomass feedstock in an autohydrolysis process. In this study, two xylanase genes, Bacillus sp. NG-27 bsx and Clostridium stercorarium xynB, were expressed in maize (Zea mays) under the control of two different promoters. Severe phenotypic effects were associated with xylanase accumulation in maize, including stunted plants and sterile grains. Global expression of these xylanases from the rice ubiquitin 3 promoter (rubi3) resulted in enzyme accumulation of approximately 0.01 mg enzyme per gram dry weight, or approximately 0.1% of total soluble protein (TSP). Grain-specific expression of these enzymes from the rice glutelin 4 promoter (GluB-4) resulted in higher-level accumulation of active enzyme, with BSX and XynB accumulating up to 4.0% TSP and 16.4% TSP, respectively, in shriveled grains from selected T0 plants. These results demonstrate the potential utility of the GluB-4 promoter for biotechnological applications. The phenotypic effects of xylanase expression in maize presented here demonstrate the difficulties of hemicellulase expression in an important crop for cellulosic biofuels production. Potential alternate approaches to achieve xylanase accumulation in planta without the accompanying negative phenotypes are discussed.
21178395	Rice WNK1 is regulated by abiotic stress and involved in internal circadian rhythm.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	In Mammalian system the WNK (with no lysine kinase) serine-threonine protein kinase gene family is suggested to be involved in regulating ion homeostasis and other pathophysiological processes including cancer, hypertension and renal ion transport. In plant system the information about WNK genes is very poor. However, WNK-like genes have also been identified in plants, including ten in Arabidopsis, designated AtWNK1-AtWNK10. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a homologue of AtWNK1 gene from Oryza sativa indica cultivar Pusa Basmati-1 rice and designated as OsWNK1. The specific feature of this gene is lysine residue in kinase subdomain II, which is essential for the coordination of ATP in the active center and conserved among all other kinases, is absent. OsWNK1 was found to respond differentially under various abiotic stresses like cold, heat, salt, drought. OsWNK1 gene showed rhythmic expression profile under diurnal and circadian conditions at the transcription level. Our data indicates that OsWNK1 in rice might play a role in abiotic stress tolerance and that it is involved in internal rhythm.
21411180	Nitric oxide production is associated with response to brown planthopper infestation in rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Nilaparvata lugens Stål, the brown planthopper (BPH), is one of the most destructive phloem-feeding insects of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout Asia. Here, we show that BPH feeding increases the level of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in the leaf and sheath tissue of both resistant and susceptible rice cultivars. However, in the roots, the NO level increased in the resistant cultivar, but decreased in the susceptible one. A burst of NO production occurred in the sheath within 1 h of infestation with BPH. The production of NO in response to BPH feeding appears to be dependent primarily on the activity of nitric oxide synthase. The application of exogenous NO reduced plant water loss by its effect on both stomatal opening and root architecture. It also stimulated the expression of certain drought stress-related genes, reduced plant height and delayed leaf senescence. Over the short term, NO supplementation reduced the seedling mortality caused by BPH feeding. This suggests that NO signaling plays a role in the rice tolerance response to BPH feeding.
21637999	Candidacy of a chitin-inducible gibberellin-responsive gene for a major locus affecting plant height in rice that is closely linked to Green Revolution gene sd1.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Appropriate plant height is crucial for lodging resistance to improve the rice crop yield. The application of semi-dwarf 1 led to the green revolution in the 1960s, by predominantly increasing the rice yield. However, the frequent use of single sd1 gene sources may cause genetic vulnerability to pests and diseases. Identifying useful novel semi-dwarf genes is important for the genetic manipulation of plant architecture in practical rice breeding. In this study, introgression lines derived from two parents contrasting in plant height, Zhenshan 97 and Pokkali were employed to locate a gene with a large effect on plant height by the bulk segregant analysis method. A major gene, ph1, was mapped to a region closely linked to sd1 on chromosome 1; the additive effects of ph1 were more than 50 cm on the plant height and 2 days on the heading date in a BC(4)F(2) population and its progeny. ph1 was then fine mapped to BAC AP003227. Gene annotation indicated that LOC_OS01g65990 encoding a chitin-inducible gibberellin-responsive protein (CIGR), which belongs to the GRAS family, might be the right candidate gene of ph1. Co-segregation analysis of the candidate gene-derived marker finally confirmed its identity as the candidate gene. A higher expression level of the CIGR was detected in all the tested tissues in tall plants compared to those of short plants, especially in the young leaf sheath containing elongating tissues, which indicated its importance role in regulating plant height. ph1 showed a tremendous genetic effect on plant height, which is distinct from sd1 and could be a new resource for breeding semi-dwarf varieties.
21220781	Spatial expression and regulation of rice high-affinity nitrate transporters by nitrogen and carbon status.	2011	J Exp Bot	The high affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition because, even under flooded anaerobic cultivation when NH(4)(+) dominates, significant nitrification occurs on the root surface. In the rice genome, four NRT2 and two NAR2 genes encoding HATS components have been identified. One gene OsNRT2.3 was mRNA spliced into OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b and OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1/2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake. Using promoter-GUS reporter plants and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, it was observed that OsNAR2.1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal cells, differently from the five OsNRT2 genes. OsNAR2.1, OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, and OsNRT2.3a were up-regulated by nitrate and suppressed by NH(4)(+) and high root temperature (37 °C). Expression of all these genes was increased by light or external sugar supply. Root transcripts of OsNRT2.3b and OsNRT2.4 were much less abundant and not affected by temperature. Expression of OsNRT2.3b was insensitive to the form of N supply. Expression of OsNRT2.4 responded to changes in auxin supply unlike all the other NRT2 genes. A region from position -311 to -1, relative to the translation start site in the promoter region of OsNAR2.1, was found to contain the cis-element(s) necessary for the nitrate-, but not light- and sugar-dependent activation. However, it was difficult to define a conserved cis-element in the promoters of the nitrate-regulated OsNRT2/OsNAR2 genes. The results imply distinct physiological functions for each OsNRT2 transporter, and differential regulation pathways by N and C status.
21416255	Conservation and divergence of plant LHP1 protein sequences and expression patterns in angiosperms and gymnosperms.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Floral transition is a critical and strictly regulated developmental process in plants. Mutations in Arabidopsis LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (AtLHP1)/TERMINAL FLOWER 2 (TFL2) result in early and terminal flowers. Little is known about the gene expression, function and evolution of plant LHP1 homologs, except for Arabidopsis LHP1. In this study, the conservation and divergence of plant LHP1 protein sequences was analyzed by sequence alignments and phylogeny. LHP1 expression patterns were compared among taxa that occupy pivotal phylogenetic positions. Several relatively conserved new motifs/regions were identified among LHP1 homologs. Phylogeny of plant LHP1 proteins agreed with established angiosperm relationships. In situ hybridization unveiled conserved expression of plant LHP1 in the axillary bud/tiller, vascular bundles, developing stamens, and carpels. Unlike AtLHP1, cucumber CsLHP1-2, sugarcane SoLHP1 and maize ZmLHP1, rice OsLHP1 is not expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the OsLHP1 transcript level is consistently low in shoots. "Unequal crossover" might have contributed to the divergence in the N-terminal and hinge region lengths of LHP1 homologs. We propose an "insertion-deletion" model for soybean (Glycine max L.) GmLHP1s evolution. Plant LHP1 homologs are more conserved than previously expected, and may favor vegetative meristem identity and primordia formation. OsLHP1 may not function in rice SAM during floral induction.
21598083	Analysis of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) gene family suggests the formation of TPS complexes in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), an intermediate in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway, is emerging as an important regulator of plant metabolism and development. T6P levels are potentially modulated by a group of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) homologues. In this study, we have isolated 11 TPS genes encoding proteins with both TPS and TPP domains, from rice. Functional complement assays performed in yeast tps1 and tps2 mutants, revealed that only OsTPS1 encodes an active TPS enzyme and no OsTPS protein possesses TPP activity. By using a yeast two-hybrid analysis, a complicated interaction network occurred among OsTPS proteins, and the TPS domain might be essential for this interaction to occur. The interaction between OsTPS1 and OsTPS8 in vivo was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, our gel filtration assay showed that there may exist two forms of OsTPS1 (OsTPS1a and OsTPS1b) with different elution profiles in rice. OsTPS1b was particularly cofractionated with OsTPS5 and OsTPS8 in the 360 kDa complex, while OsTPS1a was predominantly incorporated into the complexes larger than 360 kDa. Collectively, these results suggest that OsTPS family members may form trehalose-6-phosphate synthase complexes and therefore potentially modify T6P levels to regulate plant development.
21384360	A preliminary study of the protease activities in germinating brown rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	J Sci Food Agric	BACKGROUND: Proteases hydrolyse storage proteins to provide precursors for perpetuating species. The aim of this study was to investigate and characterise different proteases in germinating brown rice.

RESULTS: The protease activity of brown rice increased sevenfold during 7 days of germination. It was highest on day 6 when determined at pH 3.5. With casein as substrate the proteases showed two catalytic groups: acidic proteases with an optimal pH of 3.5 and alkaline proteases with an optimal pH of 8.0. The acidic protease activity was inhibited by Ba(2+) and Pb(2+) but stimulated by Zn(2+) , while the alkaline protease activity was inhibited by Ca(2+) and Pb(2+) but stimulated by Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) . SDS-gelatin-PAGE assay showed two protease activity bands at pH 3.5, while two different bands with higher molecular weights were observed at pH 8.0. Inhibition assay revealed that pepstatin A and E-64 inhibited 67.63 and 38.26% respectively of the protease activity at pH 3.5, indicating the presence of aspartic and cysteine proteases. Metalloproteases played a major role under alkaline conditions (88.37% inhibition with EDTA).

CONCLUSION: Germinated brown rice proteases fall into different classes with different properties. This study is helpful for their further purification.
21586431	The aromatic/arginine selectivity filter of NIP aquaporins plays a critical role in substrate selectivity for silicon, boron, and arsenic.	2011	J Exp Bot	Nodulin-26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) of the aquaporin family are involved in the transport of diverse solutes, but the mechanisms controlling the selectivity of transport substrates are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter influences the substrate selectivity of two NIP aquaporins; the silicic acid (Si) transporter OsLsi1 (OsNIP2;1) from rice and the boric acid (B) transporter AtNIP5;1 from Arabidopsis; both proteins are also permeable to arsenite. Native and site-directed mutagenized variants of the two genes were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the transport activities for Si, B, arsenite, and water were assayed. Substitution of the amino acid at the ar/R second helix (H2) position of OsLsi1 did not affect the transport activities for Si, B, and arsenite, but that at the H5 position resulted in a total loss of Si and B transport activities and a partial loss of arsenite transport activity. Conversely, changes of the AtNIP5;1 ar/R selectivity filter and the NPA motifs to the OsLsi1 type did not result in a gain of Si transport activity. B transport activity was partially lost in the H5 mutant but unaffected in the H2 mutant of AtNIP5;1. In contrast, both the single and double mutations at the H2 and/or H5 positions of AtNIP5;1 did not affect arsenite transport activity. The results reveal that the residue at the H5 position of the ar/R filter of both OsLsi1 and AtNIP5;1 plays a key role in the permeability to Si and B, but there is a relatively low selectivity for arsenite.
21698394	Map-based cloning proves qGC-6, a major QTL for gel consistency of japonica/indica cross, responds by Waxy in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	In this study, one major QTL affecting gel consistency (GC) of japonica/indica cross was identified on chromosome 6 using a DH population. To understand the molecular mechanism that regulates GC in rice grains, the major QTL (qGC-6) was isolated through a map-based cloning approach utilizing chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). Using 64 plants with extremely soft GC that were selected on recombinant break points between two SSR markers, RM540 and RM8200 in a BC4F2 population, qGC-6 was mapped to a 60-kb DNA region between two STS markers, S26 and S27. These two markers were then used to further identify recombination break points. Finally, qGC-6 was delimited in an interval of a 11-kb region. Gene prediction analysis of the 11-kb DNA sequence containing qGC-6 identified only one putative ORF, which encodes granule-bound starch synthesis protein (Wx protein). Results of sequencing analysis and complementation experiment confirmed that this candidate ORF is responsible for rice GC. Genetic evidences revealed that Wx might contribute equally to the grain amylose content-controlling gene as well as gel consistency. This new information is important to breed rice varieties with improved grain quality.
21364321	Enhancement of MAMP signaling by chimeric receptors improves disease resistance in plants.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Plants activate defense responses through the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Recently, several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified in plants, paving the way for manipulating MAMP signaling. CEBiP is a receptor for the chitin elicitor (CE) identified in the rice plasma membrane and XA21 is a member of the receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) family that confers disease resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight expressing the sulfated protein Ax21. To improve resistance to rice blast, the most serious fungal disease of rice, we aimed to create a defense system that combines high affinity of CEBiP for CE and the ability of XA21 to confer disease resistance. Cultured rice cells expressing the chimeric receptor CRXA, which consists of CEBiP and the intracellular region of XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after exposure to CE. Rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor exhibited more resistance to rice blast. Engineering PRRs may be a new strategy in molecular breeding for achieving disease resistance.
21398647	ABA controls H₂O₂ accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The production of both ABA and H₂O₂ is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H₂O₂ and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H₂O₂ was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H₂O₂, through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
21497713	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Plant Sci	CaRma1H1 was previously identified as a hot pepper drought-induced RING E3 Ub ligase. We have identified five putative proteins that display a significant sequence identity with CaRma1H1 in the rice genome database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/RiceGE). These five rice paralogs possess a single RING motif in their N-terminal regions, consistent with the notion that RING proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family. Therefore, these proteins were named OsRDCPs (Oryza sativa RING domain-containing proteins). Among these paralogs, OsRDCP1 was induced by drought stress, whereas the other OsRDCP members were constitutively expressed, with OsRDCP4 transcripts expressed at the highest level in rice seedlings. osrdcp1 loss-of-function knockout mutant and OsRDCP1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants were developed. Phenotypic analysis showed that wild-type plants and the homozygous osrdcp1 G2 mutant line displayed similar phenotypes under normal growth conditions and in response to drought stress. This may be due to complementation by other OsRDCP paralogs. In contrast, 35S:OsRDCP1 T2 transgenic rice plants exhibited improved tolerance to severe water deficits. Although the physiological function of OsRDCP1 remains unclear, there are several possible mechanisms for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration stress in rice plants.
21610181	K+ transport by the OsHKT2;4 transporter from rice with atypical Na+ transport properties and competition in permeation of K+ over Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions.	2011	Plant Physiol	Members of class II of the HKT transporters, which have thus far only been isolated from grasses, were found to mediate Na(+)-K(+) cotransport and at high Na(+) concentrations preferred Na(+)-selective transport, depending on the ionic conditions. But the physiological functions of this K(+)-transporting class II of HKT transporters remain unknown in plants, with the exception of the unique class II Na(+) transporter OsHKT2;1. The genetically tractable rice (Oryza sativa; background Nipponbare) possesses two predicted K(+)-transporting class II HKT transporter genes, OsHKT2;3 and OsHKT2;4. In this study, we have characterized the ion selectivity of the class II rice HKT transporter OsHKT2;4 in yeast and Xenopus laevis oocytes. OsHKT2;4 rescued the growth defect of a K(+) uptake-deficient yeast mutant. Green fluorescent protein-OsHKT2;4 is targeted to the plasma membrane in transgenic plant cells. OsHKT2;4-expressing oocytes exhibited strong K(+) permeability. Interestingly, however, K(+) influx in OsHKT2;4-expressing oocytes did not require stimulation by extracellular Na(+), in contrast to other class II HKT transporters. Furthermore, OsHKT2;4-mediated currents exhibited permeabilities to both Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) in the absence of competing K(+) ions. Comparative analyses of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) permeabilities in several HKT transporters, including Arabidopsis thaliana HKT1;1 (AtHKT1;1), Triticum aestivum HKT2;1 (TaHKT2;1), OsHKT2;1, OsHKT2;2, and OsHKT2;4, revealed that only OsHKT2;4 and to a lesser degree TaHKT2;1 mediate Mg(2+) transport. Interestingly, cation competition analyses demonstrate that the selectivity of both of these class II HKT transporters for K(+) is dominant over divalent cations, suggesting that Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) transport via OsHKT2;4 may be small and would depend on competing K(+) concentrations in plants.
21418523	Genetic analysis of two weak dormancy mutants derived from strong seed dormancy wild type rice N22 (Oryza sativa).	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Two weak dormancy mutants, designated Q4359 and Q4646, were obtained from the rice cultivar N22 after treatment with 400 Gy (60) Co gamma-radiation. Compared to the N22 cultivar, the dormancy of the mutant seeds was more readily broken when exposed to a period of room temperature storage. The mutants also showed a reduced level of sensitivity to abscisic acid compared to the N22 cultivar, although Q4359 was more insensitive than Q4646. A genetic analysis indicated that in both mutants, the reduced dormancy trait was caused by a single recessive allele of a nuclear gene, but that the mutated locus was different in each case. The results of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, based on the F(2) population from Q4359 x Nanjing35, suggested that Q4359 lacks the QTL qSdn-1 and carries a novel allele at QTL qSdn-9, while a similar analysis of the Q4646 x Nanjing35 F(2) population suggested that Q4646 lacks QTL qSdn-5, both qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 are major effect seed dormancy QTL in N22. Therefore, these two mutants were helpful to understand the mechanism of seed dormancy in N22.
21039565	Aerenchyma formation in the rice stem and its promotion by H2O2.	2011	New Phytol	• Gas spaces (aerenchyma) form as an adaptation to submergence to facilitate gas exchange. In rice (Oryza sativa), aerenchyma develop by cell death and lysis, which are poorly understood at the cellular level. • Aerenchyma formation was studied in rice stems by light microscopy. It was analyzed in response to submergence, ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) treatment, and in the MT2b::Tos17 mutant. O(2)·(-) was detected with nitroblue tetrazolium and an epinephrine assay. H(2)O(2) was detected with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. • Aerenchyma develop constitutively in all internodes of the deep-water rice variety Pin Gaew 56, but are absent from the nodes. Constitutive aerenchyma formation was also observed in two lowland rice varieties, albeit to a lesser degree. A larger number of aerenchyma are present in older internodes, and at the top of each internode, revealing developmental gradients. Submergence or treatment with the ethylene-releasing compound ethephon promoted aerenchyma formation in all genotypes analyzed. Pre-aerenchymal cells contain less starch, no chloroplasts, thinner cell walls and produce elevated levels of O(2)·(-) and H(2)O(2) compared with other parenchymal cells. Ethephon promotes O(2)·(-) formation and H(2)O(2) promotes aerenchyma formation in a dose-dependent manner. Further-more, genetic downregulation of the H(2)O(2) scavenger MT2b enhances aerenchyma formation. • Aerenchyma formation is mediated by reactive oxygen species.
21637772	ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM 1 is involved in development of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis.	2011	PLoS One	Mutants in the rice PLASTOCHRON 3 and maize VIVIPAROUS 8 genes have been shown to have reduced dormancy and ABA levels. In this study we used several mutants in the orthologous gene ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM 1 (AMP1) to determine its role in seed dormancy in Arabidopsis. Here we report that there are accession-specific effects of mutations in AMP1. In one accession, amp1 mutants produce seeds with higher dormancy, while those in two other accessions produce seeds of lower dormancy. These accession-specific effects of mutating AMP1 were shown to extend to ABA levels. We assayed global gene transcription differences in seeds of wild-type and mutant from two accessions demonstrating opposing phenotypes. The transcript changes observed indicate that the amp1 mutation shifts the seed transcriptome from a dormant into an after-ripened state. Specific changes in gene expression in the mutants give insight into the direct and indirect effects that may be contributing to the opposing dormancy phenotypes observed, and reveal a role for AMP1 in the acquisition and/or maintenance of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis.
21717189	Rare sugar D-allose suppresses gibberellin signaling through hexokinase-dependent pathway in Oryza sativa L.	2011	Planta	One of the rare sugars, D-allose, which is the epimer of D-glucose at C3, has an inhibitory effect on rice growth, but the molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibition by D-allose were unknown. The growth inhibition caused by D-allose was prevented by treatment with hexokinase inhibitors, D-mannoheptulose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1, showed a D-allose-insensitive phenotype. D-Allose strongly inhibited the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of α-amylase in embryo-less half rice seeds. The growth of the slender rice1 (slr1) mutant, which exhibits a constitutive gibberellin-responsive phenotype, was also inhibited by D-allose, and the growth inhibition of the slr1 mutant by D-allose was also prevented by D-mannoheptulose treatment. The expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes were down-regulated by D-allose treatment, and the down-regulations of gibberellin-responsive genes were also prevented by D-mannoheptulose treatment. These findings reveal that D-allose inhibits the gibberellin-signaling through a hexokinase-dependent pathway.
21705388	Identification and validation of rice reference proteins for western blotting.	2011	J Exp Bot	Studies of rice protein expression have increased considerably with the development of rice functional genomics. In order to obtain reliable expression results in western blotting, information on appropriate reference proteins is necessary for data normalization. To date, no published study has identified and systematically validated reference proteins suitable for the investigation of rice protein expression. In this study, nine candidate proteins were selected and their specific antibodies were obtained through immunization of rabbits with either recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli or synthesized peptides. Western blotting was carried out to detect the expression of target proteins in a set of 10 rice samples representing different rice tissues/organs at different developmental stages. The expression stability of the proteins was analysed using geNorm and Microcal Origin 6.0 software. The results indicated that heat shock protein (HSP) and elongation factor 1-α (eEF-1α) were the most constantly expressed among all rice proteins tested throughout all developmental stages, while the proteins encoded by conventional internal reference genes fluctuated in amount. Comparison among the profiling of translation and transcription [expressed sequence tags (EST) and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS)] revealed that a correlation existed. Based on the standard curves derived from the antigen-antibody reaction, the concentrations of HSP and eEF-1α proteins in rice leaves were ∼0.12%. Under the present experimental conditions, the lower limits of detection for HSP and eEF-1α proteins in rice were 0.24 ng and 0.06 ng, respectively. In conclusion, the reference proteins selected in this study, and the corresponding antibodies, can be used in qualitative and quantitative analysis of rice proteins.
21628471	Glycosylation regulates specific induction of rice immune responses by Acidovorax avenae flagellin.	2011	J Biol Chem	Plants have a sensitive system that detects various pathogen-derived molecules to protect against infection. Flagellin, a main component of the bacterial flagellum, from the rice avirulent N1141 strain of the Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium Acidovorax avenae induces plant immune responses including H₂O generation, whereas flagellin from the rice virulent K1 strain of A. avenae does not induce these immune responses. To clarify the molecular mechanism that leads to these differing responses between the K1 and N1141 flagellins, recombinant K1 and N1141 flagellins were generated using an Escherichia coli expression system. When cultured rice cells were treated with recombinant K1 or N1141 flagellin, both flagellins equally induced H₂O₂ generation, suggesting that post-translational modifications of the flagellins are involved in the specific induction of immune responses. Mass spectrometry analyses using glycosyltransferase-deficient mutants showed that 1,600- and 2,150-Da glycans were present on the flagellins from N1141 and K1, respectively. A deglycosylated K1 flagellin induced immune responses in the same manner as N1141 flagellin. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that glycans were attached to four amino acid residues (Ser¹⁷⁸, Ser¹⁸³, Ser²¹², and Thr³⁵¹) in K1 flagellin. Among mutant K1 flagellins in which each glycan-attached amino acid residue was changed to alanine, S178A and S183A, K1 flagellin induced a strong immune response in cultured rice cells, indicating that the glycans at Ser¹⁷⁸ and Ser¹⁸³ in K1 flagellin prevent epitope recognition in rice.
21447996	Rice GH3 gene family: regulators of growth and development.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Auxin is an indispensable hormone throughout the lifetime of nearly all plant species. Several aspects of plant growth and development are rigidly governed by auxin, from micro to macro hierarchies; auxin also has a close relationship with plant-pathogen interactions. Undoubtedly, precise auxin levels are vitally important to plants, which have many effective mechanisms to maintain auxin homeostasis. One mechanism is conjugating amino acid to excessive indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; main form of auxin) through some GH3 family proteins to inactivate it. Our previous study demonstrated that GH3-2 mediated broad-spectrum resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation and downregulating auxin signaling. Here, we further investigated the expression pattern of GH3-2 and other GH3 family paralogues in the life cycle of rice and presented the possible function of GH3-2 on rice root development by histochemical analysis of GH3-2 promoter:GUS reporter transgenic plants.
21624978	Allelic interaction of F1 pollen sterility loci and abnormal chromosome behaviour caused pollen sterility in intersubspecific autotetraploid rice hybrids.	2011	J Exp Bot	The intersubspecific hybrids of autotetraploid rice has many features that increase rice yield, but lower seed set is a major hindrance in its utilization. Pollen sterility is one of the most important factors which cause intersubspecific hybrid sterility. The hybrids with greater variation in seed set were used to study how the F(1) pollen sterile loci (S-a, S-b, and S-c) interact with each other and how abnormal chromosome behaviour and allelic interaction of F(1) sterility loci affect pollen fertility and seed set of intersubspecific autotetraploid rice hybrids. The results showed that interaction between pollen sterility loci have significant effects on the pollen fertility of autotetraploid hybrids, and pollen fertility further decreased with an increase in the allelic interaction of F(1) pollen sterility loci. Abnormal ultra-structure and microtubule distribution patterns during pollen mother cell (PMC) meiosis were found in the hybrids with low pollen fertility in interphase and leptotene, suggesting that the effect-time of pollen sterility loci interaction was very early. There were highly significant differences in the number of quadrivalents and bivalents, and in chromosome configuration among all the hybrids, and quadrivalents decreased with an increase in the seed set of autotetraploid hybrids. Many different kinds of chromosomal abnormalities, such as chromosome straggling, chromosome lagging, asynchrony of chromosome disjunction, and tri-fission were found during the various developmental stages of PMC meiosis. All these abnormalities were significantly higher in sterile hybrids than in fertile hybrids, suggesting that pollen sterility gene interactions tend to increase the chromosomal abnormalities which cause the partial abortion of male gametes and leads to the decline in the seed set of the autotetraploid rice hybrids.
21705642	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase.	2011	Plant Cell	Aliphatic alcohols naturally exist in many organisms as important cellular components; however, their roles in extracellular polymer biosynthesis are poorly defined. We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine. Chemical analysis revealed that dpw anthers had a dramatic reduction in cutin monomers and an altered composition of cuticular wax, as well as soluble fatty acids and alcohols. Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant DPW enzyme shows that it is a novel fatty acid reductase that produces 1-hexadecanol and exhibits >270-fold higher specificity for palmiltoyl-acyl carrier protein than for C16:0 CoA substrates. DPW was predominantly targeted to plastids mediated by its N-terminal transit peptide. Moreover, we demonstrate that the monocot DPW from rice complements the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana male sterile2 (ms2) mutant and is the probable ortholog of MS2. These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots.
17257172	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes.	2007	FEBS J	Substantial levels of trehalose accumulate in bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates, where it serves as a storage carbohydrate or as a protectant against environmental stresses. In higher plants, trehalose is detected at fairly low levels; therefore, a regulatory or signaling function has been proposed for this molecule. In many organisms, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase is the enzyme governing the final step of trehalose biosynthesis. Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice. Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme. OsTPP2 expression is transiently induced in response to chilling and other abiotic stresses. Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms. OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min. These characteristics of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes are consistent with very low cellular substrate concentration and tightly regulated gene expression. These data also support a plant-specific function of trehalose biosynthesis in response to environmental stresses.
21602323	Developing rice with high yield under phosphorus deficiency: Pup1 sequence to application.	2011	Plant Physiol	The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Phosphorus uptake1 (Pup1) confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency in soil and is currently one of the most promising QTLs for the development of tolerant rice (Oryza sativa) varieties. To facilitate targeted introgression of Pup1 into intolerant varieties, the gene models predicted in the Pup1 region in the donor variety Kasalath were used to develop gene-based molecular markers that are evenly distributed over the fine-mapped 278-kb QTL region. To validate the gene models and optimize the markers, gene expression analyses and partial allelic sequencing were conducted. The markers were tested in more than 80 diverse rice accessions revealing three main groups with different Pup1 allele constitution. Accessions with tolerant (group I) and intolerant (group III) Pup1 alleles were distinguished from genotypes with Kasalath alleles at some of the analyzed loci (partial Pup1; group II). A germplasm survey additionally confirmed earlier data showing that Pup1 is largely absent from irrigated rice varieties but conserved in varieties and breeding lines adapted to drought-prone environments. A core set of Pup1 markers has been defined, and sequence polymorphisms suitable for single-nucleotide polymorphism marker development for high-throughput genotyping were identified. Following a marker-assisted backcrossing approach, Pup1 was introgressed into two irrigated rice varieties and three Indonesian upland varieties. First phenotypic evaluations of the introgression lines suggest that Pup1 is effective in different genetic backgrounds and environments and that it has the potential to significantly enhance grain yield under field conditions.
21763541	Isolation and characterization of genome-specific markers in Oryza species with the BB genome.	2011	Plant Sci	Wild species of rice with many valuable agronomic traits are an important genetic resource for improving cultivated rice by wide hybridization. Genome- or chromosome-specific markers are useful for monitoring genome introgression and for identifying genome components. From 47 random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) of nine Oryza species, three bands (Ogla225, Opun225, and Opun246) were found to be genome specific with distinct sizes. Their specificities were further characterized by Southern hybridization, sequence analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Ogla225 is specifically amplified from the AA genome but homologous sequences were conserved among Oryza species. Opun225 occurs at a low copy number although is specifically amplified from Oryza punctata. There are estimated 2000-3300 repeats of Opun246 in each haploid genome of Oryza species with the BB or BBCC genome. Clusters of Opun246 repeats were detected at heterochromatic regions on almost all chromosomes of the BB genomes by FISH. Opun246 may be a useful marker for monitoring the introgression of BB genome or for identifying the conserved components of BB genome in genetic resource. The results from this study and our previous study both indicate that numerous unique repeats play role in the differentiation of the BB genome from other Oryza genomes.
15032821	Cloning and characterization of the gene for a phloem-specific glutathione S-transferase from rice leaves.	2004	Physiol Plant	The N-terminal amino-acid sequence was determined for a major rice phloem protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa, named RPP31. The corresponding full-length rice EST-clone was cloned based on the amino acid sequence. The predicted total amino-acid sequence of RPP31 shared high similarity with plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Recombinant RPP31 produced in Escherichia coli and rice phloem sap showed GST activity. Immunocytological analysis indicated that RPP31 is localized in the phloem region of leaves. In mature leaves, the signal was restricted to sieve element-companion cell complexes, and was stronger in sieve elements than in companion cells. Although some plant GSTs are known to be induced by xenobiotics, the amount of RPP31 was not affected by treatments with an herbicide, pretilachlor, and/or its safener, fenclorim. These results suggest that RPP31 is an active GST restricted to the phloem region of normal rice leaves.
8811865	rbohA, a rice homologue of the mammalian gp91phox respiratory burst oxidase gene.	1996	Plant J	It has been hypothesized that plants contain respiratory burst oxidase which, upon activation, oxidize NADPH and generate extracellular superoxide, O2.-. These proteins are proposed to play a central role in defence against pathogens. However, plant DNA sequences that encode proteins with similarity to components of respiratory burst oxidase have not previously been reported. This paper describes the complete cDNA and genomic DNA sequence of the rice rbohA (for respiratory burst oxidase homologue) gene. The predicted RbohA product is most similar to the main catalytic subunit, gp91phox, of the respiratory burst oxidase of neutrophils. Reverse transcriptase PCR detects rbohA transcripts in both roots and shoots of healthy rice plants.
21674010	Levels and patterns of nucleotide variation in domestication QTL regions on rice chromosome 3 suggest lineage-specific selection.	2011	PLoS One	Oryza sativa or Asian cultivated rice is one of the major cereal grass species domesticated for human food use during the Neolithic. Domestication of this species from the wild grass Oryza rufipogon was accompanied by changes in several traits, including seed shattering, percent seed set, tillering, grain weight, and flowering time. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has identified three genomic regions in chromosome 3 that appear to be associated with these traits. We would like to study whether these regions show signatures of selection and whether the same genetic basis underlies the domestication of different rice varieties. Fragments of 88 genes spanning these three genomic regions were sequenced from multiple accessions of two major varietal groups in O. sativa--indica and tropical japonica--as well as the ancestral wild rice species O. rufipogon. In tropical japonica, the levels of nucleotide variation in these three QTL regions are significantly lower compared to genome-wide levels, and coalescent simulations based on a complex demographic model of rice domestication indicate that these patterns are consistent with selection. In contrast, there is no significant reduction in nucleotide diversity in the homologous regions in indica rice. These results suggest that there are differences in the genetic and selective basis for domestication between these two Asian rice varietal groups.
10805599	Hormonal cross-talk between auxin and ethylene differentially regulates the expression of two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	Two cDNA clones, pOS-ACO2 and pOS-ACO3, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase were isolated from rice seedling cDNA library. pOS-ACO3 is a 1,299 bp full-length clone encoding 321 amino acids (Mr=35.9 kDa), while pOS-ACO2 is 1,072 bp long and is a partial cDNA clone encoding 314 amino acids. These two deduced amino acid sequences share 70% identity, and display a high degree of sequence identity (72-92%) with previously isolated pOS-ACO1 of deepwater rice. The chromosomal location studies show that OS-ACO2 is positioned on the long arm of chromosome 9, while OS-ACO3 on the long arm of chromosome 2 of rice genome. A marked increase in the level of OS-ACO2 transcript was observed in IAA-treated etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ACO3 mRNA was greatly accumulated by ethylene treatment. Results of ethylene inhibitor studies indicated that auxin promotion of the OS-ACO2 transcription was not mediated through the action of auxin-induced ethylene. Thus, it appears that there are two groups of ACC oxidase transcripts in rice plants, either auxin-induced or ethylene-induced. The auxin-induced OS-ACO2 expression was partially inhibited by ethylene, while ethylene induction of OS-ACO3 transcription was completely blocked by auxin. These results indicate that the expression of ACC oxidase genes is regulated by complex hormonal networks in a gene specific manner in rice seedlings. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase, effectively suppressed the IAA induction of OS-ACO2 expression, suggesting that protein dephosphorylation plays a role in the induction of ACC oxidase by auxin. A scheme of the multiple regulatory pathways for the expression of ACC oxidase gene family by auxin, ethylene and protein phosphatase is presented.
20502443	Rice DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 is essential for determining panicle outgrowth and elongation.	2010	Cell Res	The architecture of the panicle, including grain size and panicle morphology, directly determines grain yield. Panicle erectness, which is selected for achieving ideal plant architecture in the northern part of China, has drawn increasing attention of rice breeders. Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified. DEP2 encodes a plant-specific protein without any known functional domain. Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles. Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia. Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle. Despite a more compact plant type in the dep2 mutant, no significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and dep2 mutant. Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding.
21447056	Prevention of allergic asthma by vaccination with transgenic rice seed expressing mite allergen: induction of allergen-specific oral tolerance without bystander suppression.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	This study tested the feasibility of oral immunotherapy for bronchial asthma using a newly developed subunit vaccine in which a fragment (p45-145) of mite allergen (Der p 1) containing immunodominant human and mouse T cell epitopes was encapsulated in endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies of transgenic (Tg) rice seed. Allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin responses, T cell proliferation, Th1/Th2 cytokine production, airway inflammatory cell infiltration, bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) and lung histology were investigated in allergen-immunized and -challenged mice. Prophylactic oral vaccination with the Tg rice seeds clearly reduced the serum levels of allergen-specific IgE and IgG. Allergen-induced CD4(+) T cell proliferation and production of Th2 cytokines in vitro, infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils and mononuclear cells into the airways and BHR were also inhibited by oral vaccination. The effects of the vaccine were antigen-specific immune response because the levels of specific IgE and IgG in mice immunized with Der f 2 or ovalbumin were not significantly suppressed by oral vaccination with the Der p 1 expressing Tg rice. Thus, the vaccine does not induce nonspecific bystander suppression, which has been a problem with many oral tolerance regimens. These results suggest that our novel vaccine strategy is a promising approach for allergen-specific oral immunotherapy against allergic diseases including bronchial asthma.
21278385	Biochemical characterization of the novel rice kinesin K23 and its kinetic study using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between an intrinsic tryptophan residue and a fluorescent ATP analogue.	2011	J Biochem	We previously demonstrated that the rice kinesin K16, which belongs to the kinesin-7 subfamily, has unique enzymatic properties and atomic structure within key functional regions. In this study, we focused on a novel rice plant kinesin, K23, which also belongs to the kinesin-7 subfamily. The biochemical characterization of the K23 motor domain (K23MD) was studied and compared with the rice kinesin K16 and other related kinesins. K23 exhibits ∼45-fold (1.3 Pi mol(-1) site mol(-1) s(-1)) lower microtubule-dependent ATPase activity than conventional kinesins, whereas its affinity for microtubules is comparable with conventional kinesins. MgADP-free K23 is unstable compared with the unusually stable MgADP-free K16MD. The enzymatic properties of K23MD are somewhat different from those of K16. We used a fluorescent ATP analogue 2'(3')-O-(N'-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mant-ATP) for the kinetic characterization of K23. The fluorescence of mant-ATP was not significantly altered during its hydrolysis by K23. However, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between mant-ATP and W21 in the motor domain was observed. The kinetic study using FRET revealed that K23 has unique kinetic characteristics when compared with other kinesins.
21718517	Phosphoproteins regulated by heat stress in rice leaves.	2011	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: High temperature is a critical abiotic stress that reduces crop yield and quality. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants remodel their proteomes in response to high temperature stress. Moreover, phosphorylation is the most common form of protein post-translational modification (PTM). However, the differential expression of phosphoproteins induced by heat in rice remains unexplored.

METHODS: Phosphoprotein in the leaves of rice under heat stress were displayed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and Pro-Q Diamond dye. Differentially expressed phosphoproteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS/MS and confirmed by Western blotting.

RESULTS: Ten heat-phosphoproteins were identified from twelve protein spots, including ribulose bisphos-phate carboxylase large chain, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, putative mRNA binding protein, Os01g0791600 protein, OSJNBa0076N16.12 protein, putative H(+)-transporting ATP synthase, ATP synthase subunit beta and three putative uncharacterized proteins. The identification of ATP synthase subunit beta was further validated by Western-blotting. Four phosphorylation site predictors were also used to predict the phosphorylation sites and the specific kinases for these 10 phosphoproteins.

CONCLUSION: Heat stress induced the dephosphorylation of RuBisCo and the phosphorylation of ATP-β, which decreased the activities of RuBisCo and ATP synthase. The observed dephosphorylation of the mRNA binding protein and 2-Cys peroxiredoxin may be involved in the transduction of heat-stress signaling, but the functional importance of other phosphoproteins, such as H+-ATPase, remains unknown.
21486466	OryzaPG-DB: rice proteome database based on shotgun proteogenomics.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Proteogenomics aims to utilize experimental proteome information for refinement of genome annotation. Since mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics approaches provide large-scale peptide sequencing data with high throughput, a data repository for shotgun proteogenomics would represent a valuable source of gene expression evidence at the translational level for genome re-annotation.

DESCRIPTION: Here, we present OryzaPG-DB, a rice proteome database based on shotgun proteogenomics, which incorporates the genomic features of experimental shotgun proteomics data. This version of the database was created from the results of 27 nanoLC-MS/MS runs on a hybrid ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer, which offers high accuracy for analyzing tryptic digests from undifferentiated cultured rice cells. Peptides were identified by searching the product ion spectra against the protein, cDNA, transcript and genome databases from Michigan State University, and were mapped to the rice genome. Approximately 3200 genes were covered by these peptides and 40 of them contained novel genomic features. Users can search, download or navigate the database per chromosome, gene, protein, cDNA or transcript and download the updated annotations in standard GFF3 format, with visualization in PNG format. In addition, the database scheme of OryzaPG was designed to be generic and can be reused to host similar proteogenomic information for other species. OryzaPG is the first proteogenomics-based database of the rice proteome, providing peptide-based expression profiles, together with the corresponding genomic origin, including the annotation of novelty for each peptide.

CONCLUSIONS: The OryzaPG database was constructed and is freely available at http://oryzapg.iab.keio.ac.jp/.
21435050	CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 transcription factor activates the expression of LSH4 and LSH3, two members of the ALOG gene family, in shoot organ boundary cells.	2011	Plant J	The establishment of organ boundaries is a fundamental process for proper morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. In plants, the shoot meristem repetitively forms organ primordia from its periphery, and boundary cells are generated between them to separate their cellular fates. The genes CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1) and CUC2, which encode plant-specific NAC transcription factors, play central roles in establishment of the shoot organ boundaries in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we show that CUC1 protein activates expression of LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS 4 (LSH4) and its homolog LSH3 in shoot organ boundary cells. Both genes encode nuclear proteins of the Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1 (ALOG) family, the members of which are widely conserved in land plants. Expression of LSH4 and LSH3 is detected in the boundary cells of various shoot organs, such as cotyledons, leaves and floral organs, and requires the activity of CUC1 and CUC2. Experiments using the glucocorticoid receptor system indicate that transcription of LSH4 and LSH3 is directly up-regulated by CUC1. Constitutive expression of LSH4 in the shoot apex causes inhibition of leaf growth in the vegetative phase, and formation of extra shoots or shoot organs within a flower in the reproductive phase. Together, our results indicate that CUC1 directly activates transcription of the nuclear factor genes LSH4 and LSH3, which may suppress organ differentiation in the boundary region.
21610725	The rice mitochondrial iron transporter is essential for plant growth.	2011	Nat Commun	In plants, iron (Fe) is essential for mitochondrial electron transport, heme, and Fe-Sulphur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis; however, plant mitochondrial Fe transporters have not been identified. Here we show, identify and characterize the rice mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT). Based on a transfer DNA library screen, we identified a rice line showing symptoms of Fe deficiency while accumulating high shoot levels of Fe. Homozygous knockout of MIT in this line resulted in a lethal phenotype. MIT localized to the mitochondria and complemented the growth of Δmrs3Δmrs4 yeast defective in mitochondrial Fe transport. The growth of MIT-knockdown (mit-2) plants was also significantly impaired despite abundant Fe accumulation. Further, the decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S enzyme, aconitase, indicated that Fe-S cluster synthesis is affected in mit-2 plants. These results indicate that MIT is a mitochondrial Fe transporter essential for rice growth and development.
21146515	Ovule is a lateral organ finally differentiated from the terminating floral meristem in rice.	2011	Dev Biol	The floral meristem is the homeostatic source of floral organs in angiosperms. In rice, after stamen and carpel differentiation, the floral meristem is terminated and exhausted to produce an ovule. To elucidate underlying mechanisms controlling the continuous process from floral meristem termination to ovule formation, we investigated two rice mutants showing abnormalities in ovule formation. In the weak mutant of the lonely guy gene, responsible for cytokinin activation to maintain the floral meristem, ovule formation was abolished inside the normally developing carpel. The loss-of-function of the OsMADS13 gene, encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, resulted in the replacement of ovule with extra carpels. The in situ expression of tissue-specific markers in both mutants revealed that a lateral region of the terminating floral meristem adjacent to the site of carpel initiation exclusively differentiated the ovule and is apparently distinct from the remainder of the floral meristem, in contrast to previous assumptions. Our findings also suggest that primordial germ cells are initiated independently of ovule formation, but dependently on the presence of active cytokinin. We propose a novel pattern of ovule formation in angiosperms, in which the ovule is a lateral organ finally differentiated from the terminating floral meristem in rice.
21683874	Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice.	2011	Plant Sci	We generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHAP3E which encodes a subunit of a CCAAT-motif binding HAP complex. The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants showed various abnormal morphologies both in their vegetative and reproductive phases. The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase. In the reproductive phase, dense panicle was developed, and occasionally successive generation of lateral rachises and formation of double flowers were observed. These phenotypes indicate association of OsHAP3E with determination of floral meristem identity. On the other hand, repression of OsHAP3E by RNAi or by overexpressing chimeric repressor fusion constructs brought about lethality to transformed cells, and almost no transformant was obtained. This suggests that the OsHAP3E function is essential for rice cells. Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice.
21186175	OryzaExpress: an integrated database of gene expression networks and omics annotations in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Similarity of gene expression profiles provides important clues for understanding the biological functions of genes, biological processes and metabolic pathways related to genes. A gene expression network (GEN) is an ideal choice to grasp such expression profile similarities among genes simultaneously. For GEN construction, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) has been widely used as an index to evaluate the similarities of expression profiles for gene pairs. However, calculation of PCCs for all gene pairs requires large amounts of both time and computer resources. Based on correspondence analysis, we developed a new method for GEN construction, which takes minimal time even for large-scale expression data with general computational circumstances. Moreover, our method requires no prior parameters to remove sample redundancies in the data set. Using the new method, we constructed rice GENs from large-scale microarray data stored in a public database. We then collected and integrated various principal rice omics annotations in public and distinct databases. The integrated information contains annotations of genome, transcriptome and metabolic pathways. We thus developed the integrated database OryzaExpress for browsing GENs with an interactive and graphical viewer and principal omics annotations (http://riceball.lab.nig.ac.jp/oryzaexpress/). With integration of Arabidopsis GEN data from ATTED-II, OryzaExpress also allows us to compare GENs between rice and Arabidopsis. Thus, OryzaExpress is a comprehensive rice database that exploits powerful omics approaches from all perspectives in plant science and leads to systems biology.
21309865	Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice.	2011	Plant J	Organisms are covered extracellularly with cuticular waxes that consist of various fatty acids. In higher plants, extracellular waxes act as indispensable barriers to protect the plants from physical and biological stresses such as drought and pathogen attacks. However, the effect of fatty acid composition on plant development under normal growth conditions is not well understood. Here we show that the ONION1 (ONI1) gene, which encodes a fatty acid elongase (β-ketoacyl CoA synthase) involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, is required for correct fatty acid composition and normal shoot development in rice. oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very-long-chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination. These mutants also showed abnormal expression of a KNOX family homeobox gene. ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs. These results show that fatty acid elongase is required for formation of the outermost cell layer, and this layer is indispensable for entire shoot development in rice.
20400938	Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling.	2010	EMBO J	The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) is crucial for multiple aspects of plant growth and development. To study the relevant regulatory mechanisms, we isolated a rice mutant earlier flowering1, el1, which is deficient in a casein kinase I that has critical roles in both plants and animals. el1 had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of EL1 expression by exogenous GA(3). Biochemical characterization showed that EL1 specifically phosphorylates the rice DELLA protein SLR1, proving a direct evidence for SLR1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of SLR1 is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of SLR1 results in the altered GA signalling. This study shows EL1 a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development.
18173378	Gibberellin metabolism and its regulation.	2008	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are diterpene plant hormones that are biosynthesized through complex pathways and control diverse aspects of growth and development. Biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches have led to the identification of the majority of the genes that encode GA biosynthesis and deactivation enzymes. Recent studies have highlighted the occurrence of previously unrecognized deactivation mechanisms. It is now clear that both GA biosynthesis and deactivation pathways are tightly regulated by developmental, hormonal, and environmental signals, consistent with the role of GAs as key growth regulators. In some cases, the molecular mechanisms for fine-tuning the hormone levels are beginning to be uncovered. In this review, I summarize our current understanding of the GA biosynthesis and deactivation pathways in plants and fungi, and discuss how GA concentrations in plant tissues are regulated during development and in response to environmental stimuli.
12736788	Expression of novel rice gibberellin 2-oxidase gene is under homeostatic regulation by biologically active gibberellins.	2003	J Plant Res	We have cloned two genes for gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidase from rice ( Oryza sativa L.). Expression of OsGA2ox2 was not observed. The other gene, OsGA2ox3, was expressed in every tissue examined and was enhanced by the application of biologically active GA. Recombinant OsGA2ox3 protein catalyzed the metabolism of GA(1) to GA(8) and GA(20) to GA(29)-catabolite. These results indicate that OsGA2ox3 is involved in the homeostatic regulation of the endogenous level of biologically active GA in rice.
15821147	Molecular cloning of GA 2-oxidase3 from spinach and its ectopic expression in Nicotiana sylvestris.	2005	Plant Physiol	Previous work has shown that 13-hydroxylated gibberellins (GAs) are predominant in the long-day (LD) plant spinach (Spinacia oleracea; GA53, GA44, GA19, GA20, GA1, GA8, and GA29). Also present in spinach are 2-hydroxylated C20-GAs: GA97, GA98, GA99, and GA110. Levels of the most abundant GA, GA97, decreased when plants were transferred from short photoperiods (SD) to LD. When [14C]GA53 was fed to spinach plants, more GA53 was converted to GA97 in SD than in LD, and more radioactive GA20 was formed in LD than in SD. SoGA2ox3, encoding a GA 2-oxidase, was isolated from spinach. The recombinant protein converted only two C20-GA precursors, GA12 and GA53, to their respective products, GA110 and GA97. GA2ox3 competes with GA20ox1 for their common substrate, GA53. In SD, deactivation to GA97 prevails, whereas in LD conversion to GA20 is favored. Transcript levels of SoGA2ox3 were higher in shoot tips than in blades, petioles, and young leaves. Ectopic expression of SoGA2ox3 in the long-day plant Nicotiana sylvestris showed a range of dwarf phenotypes, such as reduced germination, short hypocotyl and stem, dark-green leaves, and late flowering, but normal flowers and seed production. The levels of GA53 and GA1 were 3- to 5-fold lower in transgenic plants than in wild type, whereas the levels of GA97 and GA110 increased 3- to 6-fold in transgenic plants. It is concluded that genetic manipulation of plant stature by increasing deactivation of precursors of active GA is more advantageous than increased deactivation of bioactive GA1 itself.
18952778	A novel class of gibberellin 2-oxidases control semidwarfism, tillering, and root development in rice.	2008	Plant Cell	Gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) regulate plant growth by inactivating endogenous bioactive gibberellins (GAs). Two classes of GA2oxs inactivate GAs through 2beta-hydroxylation: a larger class of C(19) GA2oxs and a smaller class of C(20) GA2oxs. In this study, we show that members of the rice (Oryza sativa) GA2ox family are differentially regulated and act in concert or individually to control GA levels during flowering, tillering, and seed germination. Using mutant and transgenic analysis, C(20) GA2oxs were shown to play pleiotropic roles regulating rice growth and architecture. In particular, rice overexpressing these GA2oxs exhibited early and increased tillering and adventitious root growth. GA negatively regulated expression of two transcription factors, O. sativa homeobox 1 and TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, which control meristem initiation and axillary bud outgrowth, respectively, and that in turn inhibited tillering. One of three conserved motifs unique to the C(20) GA2oxs (motif III) was found to be important for activity of these GA2oxs. Moreover, C(20) GA2oxs were found to cause less severe GA-defective phenotypes than C(19) GA2oxs. Our studies demonstrate that improvements in plant architecture, such as semidwarfism, increased root systems and higher tiller numbers, could be induced by overexpression of wild-type or modified C(20) GA2oxs.
18718932	Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling genes in microspore/pollen and tapetum of rice.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	To investigate the involvement of phytohormones during rice microspore/pollen (MS/POL) development, endogenous levels of IAA, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the mature anther were analyzed. We also analyzed the global expression profiles of genes related to seven phytohormones, namely auxin, GAs, CKs, brassinosteroids, ethylene, ABA and jasmonic acids, in MS/POL and tapetum (TAP) using a 44K microarray combined with a laser microdissection technique (LM-array analysis). IAA and GA(4) accumulated in a much higher amount in the mature anther compared with the other tissues, while CKs and ABA did not. LM-array analysis revealed that sets of genes required for IAA and GA synthesis were coordinately expressed during the later stages of MS/POL development, suggesting that these genes are responsible for the massive accumulation of IAA and GA(4) in the mature anther. In contrast, genes for GA signaling were preferentially expressed during the early developmental stages of MS/POL and throughout TAP development, while their expression was down-regulated at the later stages of MS/POL development. In the case of auxin signaling genes, such mirror-imaged expression observed in GA synthesis and signaling genes was not observed. IAA receptor genes were mostly expressed during the late stages of MS/POL development, and various sets of AUX/IAA and ARF genes were expressed during the different stages of MS/POL or TAP development. Such cell type-specific expression profiles of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling genes demonstrate the validity and importance of analyzing the expression of phytohormone-related genes in individual cell types independently of other cells/tissues.
20625906	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice.	2010	Chromosoma	Spo11 is a homolog of a subunit of archaebacterial topoisomerase, which catalyzes DNA double-strand breaks and initiates homologous chromosome recombination. In the present study, we silenced the SPO11-1 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) using RNAi. Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed. Telomeres can be assembled as bouquet during the zygotene stage of the OsSPO11-1-deficient plants, just as that in wild type. Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type. The central element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), ZEP1, does not load onto the chromosomes normally, implying that SC formation is disturbed severely. The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1. Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
19417775	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice.	2009	Cell Res	The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of SDS and RCK and their respective homologs, and identified their putative orthologs in poplar and rice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens. SDS deficiency also caused a decrease in pollen amounts. Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation. These results indicate that rice SDS and RCK genes have similar functions to their Arabidopsis orthologs. Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants.

20699274	TAL nucleases (TALNs): hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain.	2011	Nucleic Acids Res	DNA double-strand breaks enhance homologous recombination in cells and have been exploited for targeted genome editing through use of engineered endonucleases. Here we report the creation and initial characterization of a group of rare-cutting, site-specific DNA nucleases produced by fusion of the restriction enzyme FokI endonuclease domain (FN) with the high-specificity DNA-binding domains of AvrXa7 and PthXo1. AvrXa7 and PthXo1 are members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family whose central repeat units dictate target DNA recognition and can be modularly constructed to create novel DNA specificity. The hybrid FN-AvrXa7, AvrXa7-FN and PthXo1-FN proteins retain both recognition specificity for their target DNA (a 26 bp sequence for AvrXa7 and 24 bp for PthXo1) and the double-stranded DNA cleaving activity of FokI and, thus, are called TAL nucleases (TALNs). With all three TALNs, DNA is cleaved adjacent to the TAL-binding site under optimal conditions in vitro. When expressed in yeast, the TALNs promote DNA homologous recombination of a LacZ gene containing paired AvrXa7 or asymmetric AvrXa7/PthXo1 target sequences. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of creating a tool box of novel TALNs with potential for targeted genome modification in organisms lacking facile mechanisms for targeted gene knockout and homologous recombination.
16707243	Genome-wide analysis, evolutionary expansion, and expression of early auxin-responsive SAUR gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	Genomics	Small auxin-up RNAs (SAURs) are the early auxin-responsive genes represented by a large multigene family in plants. Here, we report the identification of 58 OsSAUR gene family members from rice (Oryza sativa japonica cv Nipponbare), the model monocot plant, by a reiterative database search and manual reannotation; 2 of these are pseudogenes. The coding sequences of OsSAURs do not possess any intron. Most of the predicted OsSAUR protein sequences harbor a putative nuclear localization signal at their N-terminus. Localized gene duplications appear to be the primary genetic event responsible for SAUR gene family expansion in rice. Interestingly, the duplication of OsSAURs was found to be associated with the chromosomal block duplication as well. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SAUR gene family expanded in rice and Arabidopsis due to species-specific expansion of the family in monocots and dicots. The auxin-responsive elements and downstream element are conserved in the upstream and downstream sequences, respectively, of OsSAURs. In addition to the 21 OsSAURs with full-length cDNA sequences and 20 with expressed sequence tags, gene expression analyses of at least 7 OsSAURs by RT-qPCR indicated that the majority of identified OsSAURs most likely are expressed in rice. The transcript abundance of the OsSAURs examined increased within a few minutes of exogenous auxin application with varying kinetics. The present study provides basic genomic information for the rice SAUR gene family and will pave the way for deciphering the precise role of SAURs in plant growth and development.
19490115	Transcript profiling reveals diverse roles of auxin-responsive genes during reproductive development and abiotic stress in rice.	2009	FEBS J	Auxin influences growth and development in plants by altering gene expression. Many auxin-responsive genes have been characterized in Arabidopsis in detail, but not in crop plants. Earlier, we reported the identification and characterization of the members of the GH3, Aux/IAA and SAUR gene families in rice. In this study, whole genome microarray analysis of auxin-responsive genes in rice was performed, with the aim of gaining some insight into the mechanism of auxin action. A comparison of expression profiles of untreated and auxin-treated rice seedlings identified 315 probe sets representing 298 (225 upregulated and 73 downregulated) unique genes as auxin-responsive. Functional categorization revealed that genes involved in various biological processes, including metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, and transport, are regulated by auxin. The expression profiles of auxin-responsive genes identified in this study and those of the members of the GH3, Aux/IAA, SAUR and ARF gene families were analyzed during various stages of vegetative and reproductive (panicle and seed) development by employing microarray analysis. Many of these genes are, indeed, expressed in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner, and the expression profiles of some of the representative genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. The differential expression of auxin-responsive genes during various stages of panicle and seed development implies their involvement in diverse developmental processes. Moreover, several auxin-responsive genes were differentially expressed under various abiotic stress conditions, indicating crosstalk between auxin and abiotic stress signaling.
11904292	Mlo, a modulator of plant defense and cell death, is a novel calmodulin-binding protein. Isolation and characterization of a rice Mlo homologue.	2002	J Biol Chem	Transient influx of Ca(2+) constitutes an early event in the signaling cascades that trigger plant defense responses. However, the downstream components of defense-associated Ca(2+) signaling are largely unknown. Because Ca(2+) signals are mediated by Ca(2+)-binding proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), identification and characterization of CaM-binding proteins elicited by pathogens should provide insights into the mechanism by which Ca(2+) regulates defense responses. In this study, we isolated a gene encoding rice Mlo (Oryza sativa Mlo; OsMlo) using a protein-protein interaction-based screening of a cDNA expression library constructed from pathogen-elicited rice suspension cells. OsMlo has a molecular mass of 62 kDa and shares 65% sequence identity and scaffold topology with barley Mlo, a heptahelical transmembrane protein known to function as a negative regulator of broad spectrum disease resistance and leaf cell death. By using gel overlay assays, we showed that OsMlo produced in Escherichia coli binds to soybean CaM isoform-1 (SCaM-1) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. We located a 20-amino acid CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) in the OsMlo C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that is necessary and sufficient for Ca(2+)-dependent CaM complex formation. Specific binding of the conserved CaMBD to CaM was corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis, a gel mobility shift assay, and a competition assay with a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent enzyme. Expression of OsMlo was strongly induced by a fungal pathogen and by plant defense signaling molecules. We propose that binding of Ca(2+)-loaded CaM to the C-terminal tail may be a common feature of Mlo proteins.
12437305	Functional conservation of wheat and rice Mlo orthologs in defense modulation to the powdery mildew fungus.	2002	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Homologs of barley Mlo are found in syntenic positions in all three genomes of hexaploid bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, and in rice, Oryza sativa. Candidate wheat orthologs, designated TaMlo-A1, TaMlo-B1, and TaMlo-D1, encode three distinct but highly related proteins that are 88% identical to barley MLO and appear to originate from the three diploid ancestral genomes of wheat. TaMlo-B1 and the rice ortholog, OsMlo2, are able to complement powdery mildew-resistant barley mlo mutants at the single-cell level. Overexpression of TaMlo-B1 or barley Mlo leads to super-susceptibility to the appropriate powdery mildew formae speciales in both wild-type barley and wheat. Surprisingly, overexpression of either Mlo or TaMlo-B1 also mediates enhanced fungal development to tested inappropriate formae speciales. These results underline a regulatory role for MLO and its wheat and rice orthologs in a basal defense mechanism that can interfere with forma specialis resistance to powdery mildews.
15352871	Conserved extracellular cysteine residues and cytoplasmic loop-loop interplay are required for functionality of the heptahelical MLO protein.	2005	Biochem J	We performed a structure-function analysis of the plasma membrane-localized plant-specific barley (Hordeum vulgare) MLO (powdery-mildew-resistance gene o) protein. Invariant cysteine and proline residues, located either in extracellular loops or transmembrane domains that have been conserved in MLO proteins for more than 400 million years, were found to be essential for MLO functionality and/or stability. Similarly to many metazoan G-protein-coupled receptors known to function as homo- and hetero-oligomers, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) analysis revealed evidence for in planta MLO dimerization/oligomerization. Domain-swap experiments with closely related wheat and rice as well as diverged Arabidopsis MLO isoforms demonstrated that the identity of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail contributes to MLO activity. Likewise, analysis of a progressive deletion series revealed that integrity of the C-terminus determines both MLO accumulation and functionality. A series of domain swaps of cytoplasmic loops with the wheat (Triticum aestivum) orthologue, TaMLO-B1, provided strong evidence for co-operative loop-loop interplay either within the protein or between MLO molecules. Our data indicate extensive intramolecular co-evolution of cytoplasmic domains in the evolutionary history of the MLO protein family.
21457711	TaSRG, a wheat transcription factor, significantly affects salt tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis.	2011	FEBS Lett	Based on our microarray-analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, RH8706-49, an unknown salt-induced gene containing a conserved DUF662 domain was identified and cloned; we named this gene TaSRG (Triticum aestivum Salt Response Gene). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that the expression of this gene was affected by salt, drought, cold, ABA and other stress conditions. The overexpression of TaSRG in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in increased salt tolerance compared with wild-type plants. In addition, subcellular localisation revealed that TaSRG encodes a protein that was found mainly in the nucleus. Our results suggest that wheat TaSRG might encode a transcription factor that could be utilised for enhancing stress tolerance in a wide range of plants.
21771914	Impaired function of the tonoplast-localized sucrose transporter in rice, OsSUT2, limits the transport of vacuolar reserve sucrose and affects plant growth.	2011	Plant Physiol	Physiological functions of sucrose (Suc) transporters (SUTs) localized to the tonoplast in higher plants are poorly understood. We here report the isolation and characterization of a mutation in the rice (Oryza sativa) OsSUT2 gene. Expression of OsSUT2-green fluorescent protein in rice revealed that OsSUT2 localizes to the tonoplast. Analysis of the OsSUT2 promoter::β-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene is highly expressed in leaf mesophyll cells, emerging lateral roots, pedicels of fertilized spikelets, and cross cell layers of seed coats. Results of Suc transport assays in yeast were consistent with a H(+)-Suc symport mechanism, suggesting that OsSUT2 functions in Suc uptake from the vacuole. The ossut2 mutant exhibited a growth retardation phenotype with a significant reduction in tiller number, plant height, 1,000-grain weight, and root dry weight compared with the controls, the wild type, and complemented transgenic lines. Analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed that ossut2 accumulated more Suc, glucose, and fructose in the leaves than the controls. Further sugar export analysis of detached leaves indicated that ossut2 had a significantly decreased sugar export ability compared with the controls. These results suggest that OsSUT2 is involved in Suc transport across the tonoplast from the vacuole lumen to the cytosol in rice, playing an essential role in sugar export from the source leaves to sink organs.
21981410	A plastid protein NUS1 is essential for build-up of the genetic system for early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions.	2011	Plant J	During early chloroplast differentiation, the regulation of the plastid genetic system including transcription and translation differs greatly from that in the mature chloroplast, suggesting the existence of a stage-dependent mechanism that regulates the chloroplast genetic system during this period. The virescent-1 (v(1)) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) is temperature-conditional and develops chlorotic leaves under low-temperature conditions. We reported previously that leaf chlorosis in the v(1) mutant is caused by blockage of the activation of the chloroplast genetic system during early leaf development. Here we identify the V(1) gene, which encodes a chloroplast-localized protein NUS1. Accumulation of NUS1 specifically occurred in the pre-emerged immature leaves, and is enhanced by low-temperature treatment. The C-terminus of NUS1 shows structural similarity to the bacterial antitermination factor NusB, which is known to play roles in the regulation of ribosomal RNA transcription. The RNA-immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that NUS1 binds to several regions of chloroplast RNA including the upstream leader region of the 16S rRNA precursor. In the leaves of the NUS1-deficient mutant, accumulation of chloroplast rRNA during early leaf development was impaired and chloroplast translation/transcription capacity was severely suppressed under low temperature. Our results suggest that NUS1 is involved in the regulation of chloroplast RNA metabolism and promotes the establishment of the plastid genetic system during early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions.
21896764	A 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase/lyase demethylates the retrotransposon Tos17 and promotes its transposition in rice.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	DNA 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) is an important epigenetic mark for transcriptional gene silencing in many eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, 5-meC DNA glycosylase/lyases actively remove 5-meC to counteract transcriptional gene silencing in a locus-specific manner, and have been suggested to maintain the expression of transposons. However, it is unclear whether plant DNA demethylases can promote the transposition of transposons. Here we report the functional characterization of the DNA glycosylase/lyase DNG701 in rice. DNG701 encodes a large (1,812 amino acid residues) DNA glycosylase domain protein. Recombinant DNG701 protein showed 5-meC DNA glycosylase and lyase activities in vitro. Knockout or knockdown of DNG701 in rice plants led to DNA hypermethylation and reduced expression of the retrotransposon Tos17. Tos17 showed less transposition in calli derived from dng701 knockout mutant seeds compared with that in wild-type calli. Overexpression of DNG701 in both rice calli and transgenic plants substantially reduced DNA methylation levels of Tos17 and enhanced its expression. The overexpression also led to more frequent transposition of Tos17 in calli. Our results demonstrate that rice DNG701 is a 5-meC DNA glycosylase/lyase responsible for the demethylation of Tos17 and this DNA demethylase plays a critical role in promoting Tos17 transposition in rice calli.
21753115	Rice ethylene-response AP2/ERF factor OsEATB restricts internode elongation by down-regulating a gibberellin biosynthetic gene.	2011	Plant Physiol	Plant height is a decisive factor in plant architecture. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants have the potential for rapid internodal elongation, which determines plant height. A large body of physiological research has shown that ethylene and gibberellin are involved in this process. The APETALA2 (AP2)/Ethylene-Responsive Element Binding Factor (ERF) family of transcriptional factors is only present in the plant kingdom. This family has various developmental and physiological functions. A rice AP2/ERF gene, OsEATB (for ERF protein associated with tillering and panicle branching) was cloned from indica rice variety 9311. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this ERF has a potential new function. Ectopic expression of OsEATB showed that the cross talk between ethylene and gibberellin, which is mediated by OsEATB, might underlie differences in rice internode elongation. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that OsEATB restricts ethylene-induced enhancement of gibberellin responsiveness during the internode elongation process by down-regulating the gibberellin biosynthetic gene, ent-kaurene synthase A. Plant height is negatively correlated with tiller number, and higher yields are typically obtained from dwarf crops. OsEATB reduces rice plant height and panicle length at maturity, promoting the branching potential of both tillers and spikelets. These are useful traits for breeding high-yielding crops.
21771866	OIP30, a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2, is a potential substrate for the pollen-predominant OsCPK25/26 in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Calcium ions are a well-known essential component for pollen germination and tube elongation. Several calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are expressed predominantly in mature pollen grains and play a critical role in pollen. However, none of their interacting proteins or downstream substrates has been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated OsCPK25/26-interacting protein 30 (OIP30), which is also predominantly expressed in pollen. OIP30 encodes a RuvB-like DNA helicase 2 (RuvBL2) that is well conserved in eukaryotic species from yeast to human. Yeast and Drosophila defective in RuvBL2 are non-viable. The interaction between OsCPK26 and OIP30 was confirmed by far-Western blot and pull-down experiments. OIP30 was phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner by OsCPK26 but not OsCPK2, which is highly similar to OsCPK26 in sequence and expression profile. OIP30 unwound partial duplex DNA with a 3' to 5' directionality by ATP hydrolysis. Concurrently, the ATPase activity of OIP30 depended on single-stranded DNA. OsCPK26 phosphorylated OIP30 and enhanced both its helicase and ATPase activity about 3-fold. OIP30 may be the potential downstream substrate for OsCPK25/26 in pollen. This report characterizes a RuvBL in plants and links its activities with its upstream regulator.
21908441	Transcriptional activation of secondary wall biosynthesis by rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The bulk of grass biomass potentially useful for cellulose-based biofuel production is the remains of secondary wall-containing sclerenchymatous fibers. Hence, it is important to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of secondary wall thickening in grass species. So far, little is known about the transcriptional regulatory switches responsible for the activation of the secondary wall biosynthetic program in grass species. Here, we report the roles of a group of rice and maize NAC and MYB transcription factors in the regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis. The rice and maize secondary wall-associated NACs (namely OsSWNs and ZmSWNs) were able to complement the Arabidopsis snd1 nst1 double mutant defective in secondary wall thickening. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, OsSWNs and ZmSWNs were sufficient to activate a number of secondary wall-associated transcription factors and secondary wall biosynthetic genes, and concomitantly result in the ectopic deposition of cellulose, xylan and lignin. It was also found that the rice and maize MYB transcription factors, OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46, are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they were able to activate the entire secondary wall biosynthetic program. Furthermore, the promoters of OsMYB46 and ZmMYB46 contain secondary wall NAC-binding elements (SNBEs), which can be bound and activated by OsSWNs and ZmSWNs. Together, our results indicate that the rice and maize SWNs and MYB46 are master transcriptional activators of the secondary wall biosynthetic program and that OsSWNs and ZmSWNs activate their direct target genes through binding to the SNBE sites.
21626211	Origin and evolution of genes related to ABA metabolism and its signaling pathways.	2011	J Plant Res	Since plants cannot move to avoid stress, they have sophisticated acclimation mechanisms against a variety of abiotic stresses. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays essential roles in abiotic stress tolerances in land plants. Therefore, it is interesting to address the evolutionary origins of ABA metabolism and its signaling pathways in land plants. Here, we focused on 48 ABA-related Arabidopsis thaliana genes with 11 protein functions, and generated 11 orthologous clusters of ABA-related genes from A. thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa, Selaginella moellendorffii, and Physcomitrella patens. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the common ancestor of these six species possessed most of the key protein functions of ABA-related genes. In two species (A. thaliana and O. sativa), duplicate genes related to ABA signaling pathways contribute to the expression variation in different organs or stress responses. In particular, there is significant expansion of gene families related to ABA in evolutionary periods associated with morphological divergence. Taken together, these results suggest that expansion of the gene families related to ABA signaling pathways may have contributed to the sophisticated stress tolerance mechanisms of higher land plants.
21495624	Plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins reduce nitrite to nitric oxide under anoxic conditions.	2011	Biochemistry	The ability of ferrous hemoglobins to reduce nitrite to form nitric oxide has been demonstrated for hemoglobins from animals, including myoglobin, blood cell hemoglobin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin. In all cases, the rate constants for the bimolecular reactions with nitrite are relatively slow, with maximal values of ~5 M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7. Combined with the relatively low concentrations of nitrite found in animal blood plasma (normally no greater than 13 μM), these slow reaction rates are unlikely to contribute significantly to hemoglobin oxidation, nitrite reduction, or NO production. Plants and cyanobacteria, however, must contend with much higher (millimolar) nitrite concentrations necessitated by assimilatory nitrogen metabolism during hypoxic growth, such as the conditions commonly found during flooding or in waterlogged soil. Here we report rate constants for nitrite reduction by a ferrous plant hemoglobin (rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin 1) and a ferrous cyanobacterial hemoglobin from Synechocystis that are more than 10 times faster than those observed for animal hemoglobins. These rate constants, along with the relatively high concentrations of nitrite present during hypoxia, suggest that plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins could serve as anaerobic nitrite reductases in vivo.
21478444	The interconversion of UDP-arabinopyranose and UDP-arabinofuranose is indispensable for plant development in Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Cell	L-Ara, an important constituent of plant cell walls, is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. Nucleotide sugar mutases have been demonstrated to interconvert UDP-Larabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa). These enzymes belong to a small gene family encoding the previously named Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). RGPs are plant-specific cytosolic proteins that tend to associate with the endomembrane system. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the RGP protein family consists of five closely related members. We characterized all five RGPs regarding their expression pattern and subcellular localizations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Enzymatic activity assays of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli identified three of the Arabidopsis RGP protein family members as UDP-L-Ara mutases that catalyze the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-Arap. Coimmunoprecipitation and subsequent liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a distinct interaction network between RGPs in different Arabidopsis organs. Examination of cell wall polysaccharide preparations from RGP1 and RGP2 knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in total L-Ara content (12–31%) compared with wild-type plants. Concomitant downregulation of RGP1 and RGP2 expression results in plants almost completely deficient in cell wall–derived L-Ara and exhibiting severe developmental defects.
21317339	LEAF TIP NECROSIS1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of multiple phosphate starvation responses in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Although phosphate (Pi) starvation signaling is well studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), it is still largely unknown in rice (Oryza sativa). In this work, a rice leaf tip necrosis1 (ltn1) mutant was identified and characterized. Map-based cloning identified LTN1 as LOC_Os05g48390, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis PHO2, which plays important roles in Pi starvation signaling. Analysis of transgenic plants harboring a LTN1 promoter::β-glucuronidase construct revealed that LTN1 was preferentially expressed in vascular tissues. The ltn1 mutant exhibited increased Pi uptake and translocation, which led to Pi overaccumulation in shoots. In association with enhanced Pi uptake and transport, some Pi transporters were up-regulated in the ltn1 mutant in the presence of sufficient Pi. Furthermore, the elongation of primary and adventitious roots was enhanced in the ltn1 mutant under Pi starvation, suggesting that LTN1 is involved in Pi-dependent root architecture alteration. Under Pi-sufficient conditions, typical Pi starvation responses such as stimulation of phosphatase and RNase activities, lipid composition alteration, nitrogen assimilation repression, and increased metal uptake were also activated in ltn1. Moreover, analysis of OsmiR399-overexpressing plants showed that LTN1 was down-regulated by OsmiR399. Our results strongly indicate that LTN1 is a crucial Pi starvation signaling component downstream of miR399 involved in the regulation of multiple Pi starvation responses in rice.
21540434	BARREN STALK FASTIGIATE1 is an AT-hook protein required for the formation of maize ears.	2011	Plant Cell	Ears are the seed-bearing inflorescences of maize (Zea mays) plants and represent a crucial component of maize yield. The first step in the formation of ears is the initiation of axillary meristems in the axils of developing leaves. In the classic maize mutant barren stalk fastigiate1 (baf1), first discovered in the 1950s, ears either do not form or, if they do, are partially fused to the main stalk. We positionally cloned Baf1 and found that it encodes a transcriptional regulator containing an AT-hook DNA binding motif. Single coorthologs of Baf1 are found in syntenic regions of brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon), rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), suggesting that the gene is likely present in all cereal species. Protein-protein interaction assays suggest that BAF1 is capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the AT-hook family. Another transcriptional regulator required for ear initiation is the basic helix-loop-helix protein BARREN STALK1 (BA1). Genetic and expression analyses suggest that Baf1 is required to reach a threshold level of Ba1 expression for the initiation of maize ears. We propose that Baf1 functions in the demarcation of a boundary region essential for the specification of a stem cell niche.
21384112	Fine mapping of qSTV11(KAS), a major QTL for rice stripe disease resistance.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rice stripe disease, caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), is one of the most serious diseases in temperate rice-growing areas. In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the highly resistant variety, Kasalath, and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare. Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, designated qSTV7 and qSTV11(KAS), were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respectively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11 under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of qSTV11(KAS) was validated using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines. Fine mapping of qSTV11(KAS) was carried out using 372 BC(3)F(2:3) recombinants and 399 BC(3)F(3:4) lines selected from 7,018 BC(3)F(2) plants of the cross SL-234/Koshihikari. The qSTV11(KAS) was localized to a 39.2 kb region containing seven annotated genes. The most likely candidate gene, LOC_Os11g30910, is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein. The predicted protein encoded by the Kasalath allele differs from Nipponbare by a single amino acid substitution and the deletion of two amino acids within the sulfotransferase domain. Marker-resistance association analysis revealed that the markers L104-155 bp and R48-194 bp were highly correlated with RSV resistance in the 148 landrace varieties. These results provide a basis for the cloning of qSTV11(KAS), and the markers may be used for molecular breeding of RSV resistant rice varieties.
21558309	Expression and genome-wide analysis of the xylogen-type gene family.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	In higher plants, many extracellular proteins are involved in developmental processes, including cell-cell signaling and cell wall construction. Xylogen is an extracellular arabinogalactan protein (AGP) isolated from Zinnia elegans xylogenic culture medium, which promotes xylem cell differentiation. Xylogen has a unique structure, containing a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) domain and AGP domains. We searched for xylogen-type genes in the genomes of land plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, to further our knowledge of xylogen-type genes as functional extracellular proteins in plants. We found that many xylogen-type genes, including 13 Arabidopsis genes, comprise a gene family in land plants, including Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Lotus japonicus, Oryza sativa, Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens. The genes shared an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a distinct nsLTP domain, one or more AGP domains and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored sequence. We analyzed transgenic plants harboring promoter::GUS (β-glucuronidase) constructs to test expression of the 13 Arabidopsis xylogen-type genes, and detected a diversity of gene family members with related expression patterns. AtXYP2 was the best candidate as the Arabidopsis counterpart of the Zinnia xylogen gene. We observed two distinct expression patterns for several genes, with some anther specific and others preferentially expressed in the endodermis/pericycle. We conclude that xylogen-type genes, which may have diverse functions, form a novel chimeric AGP gene family with a distinct nsLTP domain.
21516334	Molecular characterization and genomic mapping of the pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1) gene family in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	The group 1 pathogenesis-related (PR-1) proteins, known as hallmarks of defense pathways, are encoded by multigene families in plants as evidenced by the presence of 22 and 32 PR-1 genes in the finished Arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively. Here, we report the initial characterization and mapping of 23 PR-1-like (TaPr-1) genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which possesses one of the largest (>16,000 megabases) genomes among monocot crop plants. Sequence analysis revealed that the 23 TaPr-1 genes all contain intron-free open reading frames that encode a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a conserved PR-1-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaPr-1 genes form three major monophyletic groups along with their counterparts in other monocots; each group consists of genes encoding basic, basic with a C-terminal extension, and acidic PR-1 proteins, respectively, suggesting diversity and conservation of PR-1 gene functions in monocot plants. Mapping analysis assisted by untranslated region-specified discrimination (USD) markers and various cytogenetic stocks located the 23 TaPr-1 genes to seven different chromosomes, with the majority mapping to chromosomes of homoeologous groups 5 and 7. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that 12 TaPr-1 genes were induced or up-regulated upon pathogen challenge. Together, this study provides insights to the origin, evolution, homoeologous relationships, and expression patterns of the TaPr-1 genes. The data presented provide critical information for further genome-wide characterization of the wheat PR-1 gene family and the USD markers developed will facilitate genetic and functional analysis of PR-1 genes associated with plant defense and/or other important traits.
21398647	ABA controls H₂O₂ accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The production of both ABA and H₂O₂ is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H₂O₂ and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H₂O₂ was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H₂O₂, through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
21502188	Control of abscisic acid catabolism and abscisic acid homeostasis is important for reproductive stage stress tolerance in cereals.	2011	Plant Physiol	Drought stress at the reproductive stage causes pollen sterility and grain loss in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Drought stress induces abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis genes in anthers and ABA accumulation in spikes of drought-sensitive wheat varieties. In contrast, drought-tolerant wheat accumulates lower ABA levels, which correlates with lower ABA biosynthesis and higher ABA catabolic gene expression (ABA 8'-hydroxylase). Wheat TaABA8'OH1 deletion lines accumulate higher spike ABA levels and are more drought sensitive. ABA treatment of the spike mimics the effect of drought, causing high levels of sterility. ABA treatment represses the anther cell wall invertase gene TaIVR1, and drought-tolerant lines appeared to be more sensitive to the effect of ABA. Drought-induced sterility shows similarity to cold-induced sterility in rice (Oryza sativa). In cold-stressed rice, the rate of ABA accumulation was similar in cold-sensitive and cold-tolerant lines during the first 8 h of cold treatment, but in the tolerant line, ABA catabolism reduced ABA levels between 8 and 16 h of cold treatment. The ABA biosynthesis gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase in anthers is mainly expressed in parenchyma cells surrounding the vascular bundle of the anther. Transgenic rice lines expressing the wheat TaABA8'OH1 gene under the control of the OsG6B tapetum-specific promoter resulted in reduced anther ABA levels under cold conditions. The transgenic lines showed that anther sink strength (OsINV4) was maintained under cold conditions and that this correlated with improved cold stress tolerance. Our data indicate that ABA and ABA 8'-hydroxylase play an important role in controlling anther ABA homeostasis and reproductive stage abiotic stress tolerance in cereals.
21456578	The activity of barley NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C is independent of the oligomeric state of the protein: tetrameric structure determined by cryo-electron microscopy.	2011	Biochemistry	Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase can regulate cell metabolism through redox regulation of disulfide bridges or through removal of H(2)O(2). These two enzymatic functions are combined in NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), which contains an N-terminal thioredoxin reductase domain fused with a C-terminal thioredoxin domain. Rice NTRC exists in different oligomeric states, depending on the absence or presence of its NADPH cofactor. It has been suggested that the different oligomeric states may have diverse activity. Thus, the redox status of the chloroplast could influence the oligomeric state of NTRC and thereby its activity. We have characterized the oligomeric states of NTRC from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). This also includes a structural model of the tetrameric NTRC derived from cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle reconstruction. We conclude that the tetrameric NTRC is a dimeric arrangement of two NTRC homodimers. Unlike that of rice NTRC, the quaternary structure of barley NTRC complexes is unaffected by addition of NADPH. The activity of NTRC was tested with two different enzyme assays. The N-terminal part of NTRC was tested in a thioredoxin reductase assay. A peroxide sensitive Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (MPE) cyclase enzyme system of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway was used to test the catalytic ability of both the N- and C-terminal parts of NTRC. The different oligomeric assembly states do not exhibit significantly different activities. Thus, it appears that the activities are independent of the oligomeric state of barley NTRC.
12203890	Proteome analysis of differentially displayed proteins as a tool for investigating ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2002	Proteomics	Employing classical two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), amino acid sequencing and immunoblot analysis, we examine for the first time the effect of ozone, a highly notorious environmental pollutant, on rice seedling proteins. Drastic visible necrotic damage to leaf by ozone and consequent increase in ascorbate peroxidase protein(s) was accompanied by rapid changes in the 2-DE protein profiles, over controls. Out of a total of 56 proteins investigated, which were reproducible in repeated experiments, 52 protein spots were visually identified as differentially expressed over controls. Six proteins were N-terminally blocked, and the sequence of 14 proteins could not be determined, whereas 36 proteins were N-terminally and one was internally sequenced. Ozone caused drastic reductions in the major leaf photosynthetic proteins, including the abundantly present ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, and induction of various defense/stress related proteins. Most prominent change in leaves, within 24 h post-treatment with ozone, was the induced accumulation of a pathogenesis related (PR) class 5 protein, three PR 10 class proteins, ascorbate peroxidase(s), superoxide dismutase, calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, a novel ATP-dependent CLP protease, and an unknown protein. Present results demonstrate the highly damaging effect of ozone on rice seedlings at the level of the proteome.
11181723	Heat shock-mediated APX gene expression and protection against chilling injury in rice seedlings.	2001	J Exp Bot	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings, when kept at 42 degrees C for 24 h before being kept at 5 degrees C for 7 d, did not develop chilling injury. Chilling resistance was enhanced in parallel with the period of heat-treatment. The level of APX activity was higher in heated seedlings whereas CAT activity was decreased by heat stress. There was no significant difference in SOD activity between heated and unheated seedlings. The elevated activity of APX was sustained after 7 d of chilling. The cytosolic APX gene expression in response to high and low temperature was analysed with an APXa gene probe. APXa mRNA levels increased within 1 h after seedlings were exposed to 42 degrees C. Elevated APXa mRNA levels could also be detected after 24 h of heating. The APXa mRNA level in preheated seedlings was still higher than unheated seedlings under cold stress. The promoter of the APXa gene was cloned from rice genomic DNA by TAIL-PCR, and characterized by DNA sequencing. The promoter had a minimal heat shock factor-binding motif, 5'-nGAAnnTTCn-3', located in the 81 bp upstream of the TATA box. Heat shock induction of the APXa gene could be a possible cause of reduced chilling injury in rice seedlings.
14644501	Importance of ascorbate peroxidases OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 in the rice pathogen response pathways and growth and reproduction revealed by their transcriptional profiling.	2003	Gene	We have identified and characterized two rice ascorbate peroxidase (OsAPX1 and OsAPX2) genes against diverse signals known to involve in defense/stress responses, using "2-week-old rice seedling in vitro model system". Oryza sativa ascorbate peroxidase 1 and 2 (OsAPX1/2) share 83% similarity to each other at amino acid level and belong to a small gene family in the rice genome. OsAPX1/2 show a weak constitutive expression in leaves. Their transcripts were up-regulated upon wounding (by cut), and diverse signals such as salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (using the ethylene generator, ethephon), abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide, copper sulfate, protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN), endothall (EN) and okadaic acid (OA), and blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) attack, but surprisingly not by jasmonic acid (JA). Interestingly, the OsAPX2 inductions were more potent and rapid than OsAPX1, whose expression increased gradually with time. These inductions were influenced by light signal(s), and showed requirement for certain de novo synthesized protein factor(s). Intriguingly, OsAPX1/2 mRNAs expression manifested a clear rhythmicity under light/dark cycle. Differential regulation of the OsAPX1/2 expressions by diverse environmental cues, including pathogen, and their developmental regulation in both young and reproductive stages strongly suggests their role in stress-signaling pathways and development in rice.
15832681	Expression of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in roots of rice seedlings in response to NaCl and H2O2.	2005	J Plant Physiol	The accumulation of H2O2 by NaCl was observed in the roots of rice seedlings. Treatment with NaCl caused an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. Exogenously applied H2O2 also enhanced the activities of APX and GR and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. The accumulation of H2O2 in rice roots in response to NaCl was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). However, DPI, IMD, and dimethylthiourea, a H2O2 trap, did not reduce NaCl-enhanced activities of APX and GR and expression of OsAPX and OsGR. It appears that H2O2 is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced APX and GR activities and OsAPX and OsGR expression in rice roots.
11855722	The subcellular localization of an unusual rice calmodulin isoform, OsCaM61, depends on its prenylation status.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	Calmodulin (CaM) is a small Ca2+-binding protein highly conserved in eukaryotes. We have reported previously a novel rice CaM-like protein (OsCaM61) which contains an N-terminal CaM domain and a C-terminal extension with a potential prenylation site. Here we report in vitro activity assays confirm OsCaM61 as a functional CaM. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a visual marker, we further studied the subcellular localization of OsCaM61 in stably transformed tobacco cells. The GFP-OsCaM61 fusion protein was membrane-associated whereas OsCaM61-GFP was mainly detected in the nucleoplasm. GFP-OsCaM61 was transported into the nucleoplasm upon a block in isoprenoid biosynthesis by mevinolin treatment of cells. These results indicate that the prenylated OsCaM61 molecules are mainly membrane-associated whereas its unprenylated counterparts are transported into the nucleoplasm. Thus, OsCaM61 may play functions in co-ordinating Ca2+ signaling with isoprenoid metabolism.
20404146	A hyperactive quantitative trait locus allele of Arabidopsis BRX contributes to natural variation in root growth vigor.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Quantitative trait loci analysis of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions is increasingly exploited for gene isolation. However, to date this has mostly revealed deleterious mutations. Among them, a loss-of-function allele identified the root growth regulator BREVIS RADIX (BRX). Here we present evidence that BRX and the paralogous BRX-LIKE (BRXL) genes are under selective constraint in monocotyledons as well as dicotyledons. Unexpectedly, however, whereas none of the Arabidopsis orthologs except AtBRXL1 could complement brx null mutants when expressed constitutively, nearly all monocotyledon BRXLs tested could. Thus, BRXL proteins seem to be more diversified in dicotyledons than in monocotyledons. This functional diversification was correlated with accelerated rates of sequence divergence in the N-terminal regions. Population genetic analyses of 30 haplotypes are suggestive of an adaptive role of AtBRX and AtBRXL1. In two accessions, Lc-0 and Lov-5, seven amino acids are deleted in the variable region between the highly conserved C-terminal, so-called BRX domains. Genotyping of 42 additional accessions also found this deletion in Kz-1, Pu2-7, and Ws-0. In segregating recombinant inbred lines, the Lc-0 allele (AtBRX(Lc-0)) conferred significantly enhanced root growth. Moreover, when constitutively expressed in the same regulatory context, AtBRX(Lc-0) complemented brx mutants more efficiently than an allele without deletion. The same was observed for AtBRXL1, which compared with AtBRX carries a 13 amino acid deletion that encompasses the deletion found in AtBRX(Lc-0). Thus, the AtBRX(Lc-0) allele seems to contribute to natural variation in root growth vigor and provides a rare example of an experimentally confirmed, hyperactive allelic variant.
16043430	Expression profile of the genes for rice cation/H+ exchanger family and functional analysis in yeast.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	We identified five cation/H(+) exchangers (CAX) from rice, and phylogenetically divided them into two clusters. Gene expression and absolute amounts of mRNA in different organs were analyzed by real-time PCR. OsCAX1a showed high expression in almost all organs. OsCAX1b and OsCAX1c were detected in a limited number of organs and their expression levels were very low. The mRNA levels of OsCAX2 and OsCAX3 varied with the organ. OsCAXs were heterologously expressed in yeast to characterize the ion transport activity. All exchangers, except for OsCAX2, conferred tolerance to calcium. OsCAX1a and OsCAX3 conferred tolerance to manganese. The diversity of expression sites and substrates suggest the broad range function of CAX.
12753582	Cell cycle function of a rice B2-type cyclin interacting with a B-type cyclin-dependent kinase.	2003	Plant J	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are involved in the control of cell cycle progression. Plant A-type CDKs are functional homologs of yeast Cdc2/Cdc28 and are expressed throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, B-type CDK (CDKB) is a family of mitotic CDKs expressed during the S/M phase, and its precise function remains unknown. Here, we identified two B2-type cyclins, CycB2;1 and CycB2;2, as a specific partner of rice CDKB2;1. The CDKB2;1-CycB2 complexes produced in insect cells showed a significant level of kinase activity in vitro, suggesting that CycB2 binds to and activates CDKB2. We then expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused CDKB2;1 and CycB2;2 in tobacco BY2 cells to investigate their subcellular localization during mitosis. Surprisingly, the fluorescence signal of CDKB2;1-GFP was tightly associated with chromosome alignment as well as with spindle structure during the metaphase. During the telophase, the signal was localized to the spindle midzone and the separating sister chromosomes, and then to the phragmoplast. On the other hand, the CycB2;2-GFP fluorescence signal was detected in nuclei during the interphase and prophase, moved to the metaphase chromosomes, and then disappeared completely after the cells passed through the metaphase. Co-localization of CDKB2;1-GFP and CycB2;2-GFP on chromosomes aligned at the center of the metaphase cells suggests that the CDKB2-CycB2 complex may function in retaining chromosomes at the metaphase plate. Overexpression of CycB2;2 in rice plants resulted in acceleration of root growth without any increase in cell size, indicating that CycB2;2 promoted cell division probably through association with CDKB2 in the root meristem.
11029700	Activation of CDK-activating kinase is dependent on interaction with H-type cyclins in plants.	2000	Plant J	cDNAs encoding cyclin H homologs were isolated from poplar (Populus tremula X tremuloides) and rice (Oryza sativa) plants, and were designated Pt;cycH;1 and Os;cycH;1, respectively. The deduced amino-acid sequences showed 40-60% similarity to human cyclin H and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcs2, with higher similarity in the cyclin box region. While Pt;cycH;1 and Os;cycH;1 were expressed in all tissues examined, the transcripts accumulated abundantly in dividing cells. Expression of Os;cycH;1 was abundant in the S-phase in partially synchronized suspension cells, and was induced by submergence in internodes of deepwater rice. A yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that both Pt;CycH;1 and Os;CycH;1 were able to interact with rice R2 kinase, which is structurally and functionally similar to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) of vertebrates. Moreover, an in vitro pull-down assay showed that Os;CycH;1 specifically bound to R2 but not to other rice CDKs. When R2 was expressed in budding yeast CAK mutant, the suppression activity in terms of temperature-sensitivity was enhanced by co-expression with Os;cycH;1. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assay indicated that the kinase activities of R2 on CDKs and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were markedly elevated by binding to Os;CycH;1. Our results suggest that cyclin H is a regulatory subunit of CAK, which positively controls CDK- and CTD-kinase activities in plant cells.
12803618	Differential expression of three members of the AMT1 gene family encoding putative high-affinity NH4+ transporters in roots of Oryza sativa subspecies indica.	2003	Plant Cell Environ	In order to investigate the molecular basis of high-affinity ammonium absorption by roots of rice plants (Oryza sativa subspecies indica) the expression patterns of three members of the AMT1 family of genes in rice seedling roots in response to altered nitrogen provision and diurnal changes in irradiance were examined. The 13NH4+ influx and transcript levels of OsAMT1.1 in roots decreased several fold within 48 h when plants acclimated to 10 micro m external NH4+ for 3 weeks were transferred to 10 mm NH4+. Likewise when plants acclimated in 10 mm NH4+ were transferred to 10 micro m NH4+, there was an equally rapid up-regulation of OsAMT1.1 and 13NH4+ influx in the roots. Changes in transcript abundance of OsAMT1.2 following these treatments were approximately 50% less than in OsAMT1.1, and changes of OsAMT1.3 expression were even less. By contrast, in response to the diurnal changes of irradiance, root transcript abundance of OsAMT1.3 and 15NH4+ influx increased approximately three-fold late in the photoperiod, whereas OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 exhibited only modest changes. The present results suggest that high-affinity NH4+ influx is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level through the expression of three members of the OsAMT1 family of genes in roots of rice seedlings in response to changes of N status and daily irradiance. In general, these findings are in agreement with earlier observations in Arabidopsis and tomato.
16028114	Identification of phosphoproteins regulated by gibberellin in rice leaf sheath.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	To identify the gibberellin (GA) signaling components involved in rice leaf sheath elongation process, protein phosphorylation changed by GA3 was analyzed. The protein kinase activities in rice leaf sheath were assessed in an in-gel kinase assay using SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing histone III-S as a substrate. The activity of a putative 54-kDa calcium dependent protein kinase (CDPK) in cytosolic fraction in rice leaf sheath increased significantly by GA3. Further, phosphorylation status of the proteins changed by GA3 in rice leaf sheath were detected by in vitro protein phosphorylation followed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Sixty phosphoproteins was detected after in vitro protein phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of 7 proteins was enhanced by GA3 treatment. The addition of GA3 treated cytosolic fraction of leaf sheath further increased the phosphorylation of 4 proteins, glyoxalase-I, cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and another unknown protein. The protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine inhibited the phosphorylation of these proteins in vitro. Other hormones, particularly, indole acetic acid, 6-benzylaminopurine and abscisic acid did not change the phosphorylation status of these proteins. The identified proteins did not show any change by GA3 treatment at transcription level. The abundance of glyoxalase-I and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase remained unchanged by GA3 treatment as detected on 2D-gel by silver staining, unlike for glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Results suggest that the phosphoproteins, glyoxalase-I and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase in rice leaf sheath could be important signaling components of GA3, downstream to 54-kDa CDPK.
16146529	OsMADS1, a rice MADS-box factor, controls differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea and is an early-acting regulator of inner floral organs.	2005	Plant J	Grass flowers are highly derived compared to their eudicot counterparts. To delineate OsMADS1 functions in rice floret organ development we have examined its evolution and the consequences of its knockdown or overexpression. Molecular phylogeny suggests the co-evolution of OsMADS1 with grass family diversification. OsMADS1 knockdown perturbs the differentiation of specific cell types in the lemma and palea, creating glume-like features, with severe derangements in lemma differentiation. Conversely, ectopic OsMADS1 expression suffices to direct lemma-like differentiation in the glume. Strikingly, in many OsMADS1 knockdown florets glume-like organs occupy all the inner whorls. Such effects in the second and third whorl are unexplained, as wild-type florets do not express OsMADS1 in these primordia and because transcripts for rice B and C organ-identity genes are unaffected by OsMADS1 knockdown. Through a screen for OsMADS1 targets we identify a flower-specific Nt-gh3 type gene, OsMGH3, as a downstream gene. The delayed transcription activation of OsMGH3 by dexamethasone-inducible OsMADS1 suggests indirect activation. The OsMGH3 floret expression profile suggests a novel role for OsMADS1 as an early-acting regulator of second and third whorl organ fate. We thus demonstrate the differential contribution of OsMADS1 for lemma versus palea development and provide evidence for its regulatory function in patterning inner whorl organs.
15629062	The WRKY transcription factor superfamily: its origin in eukaryotes and expansion in plants.	2005	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: WRKY proteins are newly identified transcription factors involved in many plant processes including plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, genes encoding WRKY proteins have been identified only from plants. Comprehensive search for WRKY genes in non-plant organisms and phylogenetic analysis would provide invaluable information about the origin and expansion of the WRKY family.

RESULTS: We searched all publicly available sequence data for WRKY genes. A single copy of the WRKY gene encoding two WRKY domains was identified from Giardia lamblia, a primitive eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum, a slime mold closely related to the lineage of animals and fungi, and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an early branching of plants. This ancestral WRKY gene seems to have duplicated many times during the evolution of plants, resulting in a large family in evolutionarily advanced flowering plants. In rice, the WRKY gene family consists of over 100 members. Analyses suggest that the C-terminal domain of the two-WRKY-domain encoding gene appears to be the ancestor of the single-WRKY-domain encoding genes, and that the WRKY domains may be phylogenetically classified into five groups. We propose a model to explain the WRKY family's origin in eukaryotes and expansion in plants.

CONCLUSIONS: WRKY genes seem to have originated in early eukaryotes and greatly expanded in plants. The elucidation of the evolution and duplicative expansion of the WRKY genes should provide valuable information on their functions.
16106749	The WRKY family of transcription factors in rice and Arabidopsis and their origins.	2005	DNA Res	WRKY transcription factors, originally isolated from plants contain one or two conserved WRKY domains, about 60 amino acid residues with the WRKYGQK sequence followed by a C2H2 or C2HC zinc finger motif. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that the WRKY proteins play significant roles in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in development. In this research, we identified 102 putative WRKY genes from the rice genome and compared them with those from Arabidopsis. The WRKY genes from rice and Arabidopsis were divided into three groups with several subgroups on the basis of phylogenies and the basic structure of the WRKY domains (WDs). The phylogenetic trees generated from the WDs and the genes indicate that the WRKY gene family arose during evolution through duplication and that the dramatic amplification of rice WRKY genes in group III is due to tandem and segmental gene duplication compared with those of Arabidopsis. The result suggests that some of the rice WRKY genes in group III are evolutionarily more active than those in Arabidopsis, and may have specific roles in monocotyledonous plants. Further, it was possible to identify the presence of WRKY-like genes in protists (Giardia lamblia and Dictyostelium discoideum) and green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through database research, demonstrating the ancient origin of the gene family. The results obtained by alignments of the WDs from different species and other analysis imply that domain gain and loss is a divergent force for expansion of the WRKY gene family, and that a rapid amplification of the WRKY genes predate the divergence of monocots and dicots. On the basis of these results, we believe that genes encoding a single WD may have been derived from the C-terminal WD of the genes harboring two WDs. The conserved intron splicing positions in the WDs of higher plants offer clues about WRKY gene evolution, annotation, and classification.
21322560	Functional proteomic analysis of rice bran esterases/lipases and characterization of a novel recombinant esterase.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	An esterase from rice ( Oryza sativa ) bran was identified on two-dimensional gel using 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate as a substrate. The esterase cDNA (870 bp) encoded a 289 amino acid protein (designated OsEST-b) and was expressed in Escherichia coli . The molecular weight of recombinant OsEST-b (rOsEST-b) was 27 kDa, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that rOsEST-b was active over a broad temperature range (optimum at 60 °C) and preferred alkaline conditions (optimum at pH 9.0). The rOsEST-b showed maximum activity toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C(4)) among various p-nitrophenyl esters (C(4)-C(18)), indicating that rOsEST-b is an esterase for short-chain fatty acids. The kinetic parameters under optimal conditions were K(m) = 27.03 μM, k(cat) = 49 s(-1), and k(cat)/K(m) = 1.81 s(-1) μM(-1). The activity of rOsEST-b was not influenced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that it is not a metalloenzyme. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that OsEST-b had a conserved pentapeptide esterase/lipase motif but that the essential active site serine (GXSXG) was replaced by cysteine (C). These results suggest that OsEST-b is distinct from traditional esterases/lipases and is a novel lipolytic enzyme in rice bran.
21318489	The role of tocopherol cyclase in salt stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	Sci China Life Sci	Tocopherols synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms are major antioxidants in biomembranes. In plants, tocopherol cyclase (TC/VTE1) catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-dimethyl-5-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMPBQ) to γ-tocopherol. In the present study, OsVTE1, which encodes a rice tocopherol cyclase ortholog, was cloned and characterized. OsVTE1 was induced significantly by abiotic stresses such as high salt, H(2)O(2), drought, cold and by the plant hormones ABA and salicylic acid. The tissue-specific expression pattern and OsVTE1-promoter GUS activity assay showed that OsVTE1 was mainly expressed in the leaf, and also could be detected in the root, stem and panicle. Compared with control plants, transgenic plants with Os-VTE1 RNA interference (OsVTE1-RNAi) were more sensitive to salt stress whereas, in contrast, transgenic plants overexpressing OsVTE1 (OsVTE1-OX) showed higher tolerance to salt stress. The DAB in vivo staining showed that OsVTE1-OX plants accumulated less H(2)O(2) than did control plants.
21269485	Glycine-rich RNA binding protein of Oryza sativa inhibits growth of M15 E. coli cells.	2011	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: Plant glycine-rich RNA binding proteins have been implicated to have roles in diverse abiotic stresses.

FINDINGS: E. coli M15 cells transformed with full-length rice glycine-rich RNA binding protein4 (OsGR-RBP4), truncated rice glycine-rich RNA binding protein4 (OsGR-RBP4ΔC) and rice FK506 binding protein (OsFKBP20) were analyzed for growth profiles using both broth and solid media. Expression of OsGR-RBP4 and OsGR-RBP4ΔC proteins caused specific, inhibitory effect on growth of recombinant M15 E. coli cells. The bacterial inhibition was shown to be time and incubation temperature dependent. Removal of the inducer, IPTG, resulted in re-growth of the cells, indicating that effect of the foreign proteins was of reversible nature. Although noted at different levels of dilution factors, addition of purified Os-GR-RBP4 and OsGR-RBP4ΔC showed a similar inhibitory effect as seen with expression inside the bacterial cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Expression of eukaryotic, stress-associated OsGR-RBP4 protein in prokaryotic E. coli M15 cells proves injurious to the growth of the bacterial cells. E. coli genome does not appear to encode for any protein that has significant homology to OsGR-RBP4 protein. Therefore, the mechanism of inhibition appears to be due to some illegitimate interactions of the OsGR-RBP4 with possibly the RNA species of the trans-host bacterial cells. The detailed mechanism underlying this inhibition remains to be worked out.
21528404	Expression of OsDREB2A transcription factor confers enhanced dehydration and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Biotechnol Lett	Stress responsive transcriptional regulation is an adaptive strategy of plants that alleviates the adverse effects of environmental stresses. The ectopic overexpression of Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding transcription factors (DREBs) either in homologous or in heterologous plants improved stress tolerance indicating the DRE/DREB regulon is conserved across plants. We developed 30 transgenic T(0) rice plants overexpressing OsDREB2A which were devoid of any growth penalty or phenotypic abnormalities during stressed or non-stressed conditions. Integration of T-DNA in the rice genome and stress inducible overexpression of OsDREB2A had occurred in these transgenic lines. Functional analyses of T(1)-3 and T(1)-10 lines revealed significant tolerance to osmotic, salt and dehydration stresses during simulated stress conditions with enhanced growth performance as compared to wild type. OsDREB2A, thus, confers stress tolerance in homologous rice system that failed in the heterologous Arabidopsis system earlier.
21213008	Genome-wide analysis of rice and Arabidopsis identifies two glyoxalase genes that are highly expressed in abiotic stresses.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Glyoxalase pathway, ubiquitously found in all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, consists of glyoxalase I (GLY I) and glyoxalase II (GLY II) enzymes, which detoxify a cytotoxic molecule, methylglyoxal (MG). Increase in MG has been correlated with various diseases in humans and different abiotic stresses in plants. We have previously shown that overproduction of GLY I and/or GLY II enzymes in transgenic plants provide tolerance towards salinity and heavy metal stresses. We have identified nineteen potential GLY I and four GLY II proteins in rice and twenty two GLY I and nine GLY II proteins in Arabidopsis. An analysis of complete set of genes coding for the glyoxalase proteins in these two genomes is presented, including classification and chromosomal distribution. Expression profiling of these genes has been performed in response to multiple abiotic stresses, in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development using publicly available databases (massively parallel signature sequencing and microarray). AtGLYI8, OsGLYI3, and OsGLYI10 expresses constitutively high in seeds while AtGLYI4, AtGLYI7, OsGLYI6, and OsGLYI11 are highly stress inducible. To complement this analyses, qRT-PCR is performed in two contrasting rice genotypes, i.e., IR64 and Pokkali where OsGLYI6 and OsGLYI11 are found to be highly stress inducible.
21481190	Expression analysis of the nucleocytoplasmic lectin 'Orysata' from rice in Pichia pastoris.	2011	FEBS J	The Oryza sativa lectin, abbreviated Orysata, is a mannose-specific, jacalin-related lectin expressed in rice plants after exposure to certain stress conditions. Expression of a fusion construct containing the rice lectin sequence linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein in Bright Yellow 2 tobacco cells revealed that Orysata is located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the plant cell, indicating that it belongs to the class of nucleocytoplasmic jacalin-related lectins. Since the expression level of Orysata in rice tissues is very low the lectin was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris with the Saccharomyces α-factor sequence to direct the recombinant protein into the secretory pathway and express the protein into the medium. Approximately 12 mg of recombinant lectin was purified per liter medium. SDS/PAGE and western blot analysis showed that the recombinant lectin exists in two molecular forms. Far western blot analysis revealed that the 23 kDa lectin polypeptide contains an N-glycan which is absent in the 18.5 kDa polypeptide. Characterization of the glycans present in the recombinant Orysata revealed high-mannose structures, Man9-11 glycans being the most abundant. Glycan array analysis showed that Orysata interacts with high-mannose as well as with more complex N-glycan structures. Orysata has potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus and anti-respiratory syncytial virus activity in cell culture compared with other jacalin-related lectins.
21494323	Biochemical and structural properties of cyanases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2011	PLoS One	Cyanate is toxic to all organisms. Cyanase converts cyanate to CO₂ and NH₃ in a bicarbonate-dependent reaction. The biophysical functions and biochemical characteristics of plant cyanases are poorly studied, although it has been investigated in a variety of proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi. In this study, we characterised plant cyanases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (AtCYN and OsCYN). Prokaryotic-expressed AtCYN and OsCYN both showed cyanase activity in vitro. Temperature had a similar influence on the activity of both cyanases, but pH had a differential impact on AtCYN and OsCYN activity. Homology modelling provided models of monomers of AtCYN and OsCYN, and a coimmunoprecipitation assay and gel filtration indicated that AtCYN and OsCYN formed homodecamers. The analysis of single-residue mutants of AtCYN indicated that the conserved catalytic residues also contributed to the stability of the homodecamer. KCNO treatment inhibited Arabidopsis germination and early seedling growth. Plants containing AtCYN or OsCYN exhibited resistance to KCNO stress, which demonstrated that one role of cyanases in plants is detoxification. Transcription level of AtCYN was higher in the flower than in other organs of Arabidopsis. AtCYN transcription was not significantly affected by KCNO treatment in Arabidopsis, but was induced by salt stress. This research broadens our knowledge on plant detoxification of cyanate via cyanase.
21251109	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes.	2011	Plant J	The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR-Pia avirulence gene. To clone Pia, we employed a multifaceted genomics approach. First, we selected 12 R-gene analog (RGA) genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins from a region on chromosome 11 that shows linkage to Pia. By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes. We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar 'Sasanishiki' harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype. DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4. The wild-type 'Sasanishiki' allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function. However, when the rice cultivar 'Himenomochi' lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered. An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function. A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection.
21670506	Rice ABCG43 is Cd inducible and confers Cd tolerance on yeast.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	An understanding of the cadmium (Cd) transport system in rice can serve as a basis for coping with Cd-related problems in rice and human health. To identify a new gene involved in Cd transport in rice, we screened our yeast library, expressing 140 kinds of rice ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters. From the screening, we found that OsABCG43/PDR5 conferred high Cd tolerance on yeast. The Cd concentration of yeast carrying OsABCG43 was similar to that of the vector control. The OsABCG43 transcript was detected both in shoots and roots. Accumulation of it was elevated by Cd treatment in the roots but not in the shoots. This study indicates that OsABCG43 is a Cd inducible-transporter gene capable of conferring Cd tolerance on yeast.
21558459	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants have a family of proteins referred to as ICKs (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK) or KRPs (Kip-related proteins) that function to regulate the activities of CDK. Knowledge of these plant CDK inhibitors has been gained mostly from studies of selected members in dicotyledonous plants, particularly Arabidopsis. Much remains to be learned regarding the differences among various members of the ICK/KRP family, and regarding the function and regulation of these proteins in monocotyledonous plants.

METHODS: We analysed ICK-related sequences in the rice (Orysa sativa L. subsp. indica) genome and determined that there are six members with the conserved C-terminal signature region for ICK/KRP proteins. They are referred to as OsiICKs and further analyses were performed. The interactions with CDKs and cyclins were determined by a yeast two-hybrid assay, and cellular localization by fusion with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expression of OsiICK6 in different tissues and in response to several treatments was analysed by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Furthermore, OsiICK6 was over-expressed in transgenic rice plants and significant phenotypes were observed.

KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively. Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA. Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus. Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern. Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting. In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades.
21521631	The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa L.) Os4BGlu12, an oligosaccharide and tuberonic acid glucoside-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase with significant thioglucohydrolase activity.	2011	Arch Biochem Biophys	Rice Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) β-glucosidase, hydrolyzes β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucosyl residues and the β-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose, as well as certain glycosides. The crystal structures of apo Os4BGlu12, and its complexes with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxyl-2-fluoroglucoside (DNP2FG) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (G2F) were solved at 2.50, 2.45 and 2.40Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of rice Os4BGlu12 is typical of GH1 enzymes, but it contains an extra disulfide bridge in the loop B region. The glucose ring of the G2F in the covalent intermediate was found in a (4)C(1) chair conformation, while that of the noncovalently bound DNP2FG had a (1)S(3) skew boat, consistent with hydrolysis via a (4)H(3) half-chair transition state. The position of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu393) in the G2F structure was more similar to that of the Sinapsis alba myrosinase G2F complex than to that in covalent intermediates of other O-glucosidases, such as rice Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7 β-glucosidases. This correlated with a significant thioglucosidase activity for Os4BGlu12, although with 200- to 1200-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) values for S-glucosides than the comparable O-glucosides, while hydrolysis of S-glucosides was undetectable for Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7.
21221128	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice.	2011	Cell Res	The events occurring at the onset of meiosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, OsAM1 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning. OsAM1, a homolog of Arabidopsis SWI1 and maize AM1, encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain in its central region. In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition. Immunocytological analysis revealed that OsAM1 exists as foci in early prophase I meiocytes. Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8. In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes. In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis.
21205187	Rice phospholipase Dα is involved in salt tolerance by the mediation of H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Phospholipase Dα (PLDα) is involved in plant response to salt stress, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated rice PLDα (OsPLDα) localization and its effect on tonoplast (TP) and plasma membrane (PM) H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription in response to NaCl. When rice suspension-cultured cells were treated with 100 mM NaCl, PLDα activity in cell extracts showed a transient activation with a threefold increase at 1 h. The amount of OsPLDα protein decreased slightly in the cytosolic fractions, whereas it increased significantly in the TP after NaCl treatment. OsPLDα1 knockdown cells were developed using RNA interference (RNAi) methods. The increase in TP and PM H(+)-ATPase activity induced by NaCl was significantly inhibited in OsPLDα1-RNAi cells. Knockdown of OsPLDα1 prevented the NaCl-induced increase in the transcript level of OsVHA-A (encodes TP H(+)-ATPase) and OSA2 (encodes PM H(+)-ATPase), as well as OsNHX1 (encodes TP Na(+) /H(+) antiporter). The cells died more in OsPLDα1-RNAi mutant than in wild type when they were treated with NaCl. These results suggest that OsPLDα is involved in salt tolerance in rice through the mediation of H(+)-ATPase activity and transcription.
21324151	Proteomic identification of OsCYP2, a rice cyclophilin that confers salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings when overexpressed.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: High Salinity is a major environmental stress influencing growth and development of rice. Comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from Shanyou 10 seedlings, a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components involved in salt-stress signaling.

RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis of one protein that was upregulated during salt-induced stress, cyclophilin 2 (OsCYP2), indicated that OsCYP2 transgenic rice seedlings had better tolerance to salt stress than did wild-type seedlings. Interestingly, wild-type seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no such change was observed for OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings. OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings had lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings. Spatiotemporal expression analysis of OsCYP2 showed that it could be induced by salt stress in both Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, but Shanyou 10 seedlings showed higher OsCYP2 expression levels. Moreover, circadian rhythm expression of OsCYP2 in Shanyou 10 seedlings occurred earlier than in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Treatment with PEG, heat, or ABA induced OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 seedlings but inhibited its expression in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Cold stress inhibited OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. In addition, OsCYP2 was strongly expressed in shoots but rarely in roots in two rice hybrid varieties.

CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that OsCYP2 may act as a key regulator that controls ROS level by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level. OsCYP2 expression is not only induced by salt stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover, OsCYP2 is also likely to act as a key component that is involved in signal pathways of other types of stresses-PEG, heat, cold, or ABA.
21899054	Cloning, molecular characterization and heterologous expression of a glutathione S-transferase gene in rice.	None	Bioorg Khim	OsGSTL2 is one of three tandem-arranged glutathione S-transferase, lambda class genes in chromosome 3 of rice (Oryza sativa L.). It includes 9 introns and 10 exons, and encodes a protein of 244 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 27.37 kDa. The predicted three-dimensional structure of OsGSTL2 showed a typical glutathione S-transferase fold. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, OsGSTL2 transcript was detected in the roots and leaves of seedling stage and tillering stage, and the roots, leaves and panicles of heading stage from rice plants, and the expression level of OsGSTL2 mRNA in rice roots show significant change under chlorsulfuron stress. The OsGSTL2 gene was cloned into pYTV vector and was transformed into yeast strain PEP4. Western blot analysis showed the exogenous OsGSTL2 was expressed in transformed yeast. GST activity of crude extracts of yeast showed the OsGSTL2 transgenic yeast had higher levels of GST activities than control yeasts. These findings suggested that the OsGSTL2 is a glutathione S-transferase and has potential use in detoxification.
21360613	Thermodynamic characterization of OsGID1-gibberellin binding using calorimetry and docking simulations.	None	J Mol Recognit	Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones regulating various developmental processes in plants. In rice, the initial GA-signaling events involve the binding of a GA to the soluble GA receptor protein, GID1. Although X-ray structures for certain GID1/GA complexes have recently been determined, an examination of the complexes does not fully clarify how GID1s discriminate among different GAs. Herein, we present a study aimed at defining the types of forces important to binding via a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and computational docking studies that employed rice GID1 (OsGID1), OsGID1 mutants, which were designed to have a decreased possible number of hydrogen bonds with bound GA, and GA variants. We find that, in general, GA binding is enthalpically driven and that a hydrogen bond between the phenolic hydroxyl of OsGID1 Tyr134 and the C-3 hydroxyl of a GA is a defining structural element. A hydrogen-bond network that involves the C-6 carboxyl of a GA that directly hydrogen bonds the hydroxyl of Ser198 and indirectly, via a two-water-molecule network, the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr329 and the NH of the amide side-chain of Asn255 is also important for GA binding. The binding of OsGID1 by GA(1) is the most enthalpically driven association found for the biologically active GAs evaluated in this study. This observation might be a consequence of a hydrogen bond formed between the hydroxyl at the C-13 position of GA(1) and the main chain carbonyl of OsGID1 Phe245. Our results demonstrate that by combining ITC experiments and computational methods much can be learned about the thermodynamics of ligand/protein binding.
21595879	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase is expressed in cortical root cells during the presymbiotic phase of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis consists of a mutualistic relationship between soil fungi and roots of most plant species. This association provides the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus with sugars while the fungus improves the uptake of water and mineral nutrients in the host plant. Then, the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis requires the fine tuning of host gene expression for recognition and accommodation of the fungal symbiont. In plants, calcium plays a key role as second messenger during developmental processes and responses to environmental stimuli. Even though calcium transients are known to occur in host cells during the AM symbiosis, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood.

RESULTS: The expression of seventeen Calcium-dependent Protein Kinase (CPK) genes representative of the four distinct phylogenetic groups of rice CPKs was monitored during the presymbiotic phase of the AM symbiosis. Among them, OsCPK18 and OsCPK4, were found to be transcriptionally activated in response to inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices. OsCPK18 and OsCPK4 gene expression was also up-regulated by fungal-produced diffusible molecules. Laser microdissection revealed expression of OsCPK18 in cortical cells, and not in epidermal cells of G. intraradices-inoculated rice roots, suggesting a preferential role of this gene in the root cortex. Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK18 in onion epidermal cells. We also show that the myristoylation site of the OsCPK18 N-terminus is required for plasma membrane targeting.

CONCLUSION: The rapid activation of OsCPK18 expression in response to AM inoculation, its expression being also induced by fungal-secreted signals, together with the observed plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18, points to a role for OsCPK18 in perception of the AM fungus. The OsCPK18 gene might be considered as a marker for the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process. These findings provide a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms operating during the AM symbiosis and will greatly facilitate their molecular dissection.
20978084	OsCAND1 is required for crown root emergence in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	Crown roots are main components of the fibrous root system and important for crops to anchor and absorb water and nutrition. To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND1). The defect of visible crown root in the Oscand1 mutant is the result of cessation of the G2/M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem. Map-based cloning revealed that OsCAND1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis CAND1. During crown root primordium development, the expression of OsCAND1 is confined to the root cap after the establishment of fundamental organization. The transgenic plants harboring DR5::GUS showed that auxin signaling in crown root tip is abnormal in the mutant. Exogenous auxin application can partially rescue the defect of crown root development in Oscand1. Taken together, these data show that OsCAND1 is involved in auxin signaling to maintain the G2/M cell cycle transition in crown root meristem and, consequently, the emergence of crown root. Our findings provide new information about the molecular regulation of the emergence of crown root in rice.
21221698	Differential expression and alternative splicing of rice sulphate transporter family members regulate sulphur status during plant growth, development and stress conditions.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Sulphur, an essential nutrient required for plant growth and development, is mainly taken up by the plants as inorganic sulphate from the soil and assimilated into the sulphur reductive pathway. The uptake and transport of sulphate in plants is carried out by transporters encoded by the sulphate transporter gene family. Plant sulphate transporters have been classified with respect to their protein sequences, kinetic properties and tissue-specific localization in Arabidopsis. Though sulphate transporter genes from few other plants have also been characterized, no detailed study with respect to the structure and expression of this family from rice has been carried out. Here, we present genome-wide identification, structural and expression analyses of the rice sulphate transporter gene family. Our analysis using microarray data and MPSS database suggests that 14 rice sulphate transporters are differentially expressed during growth and development in various tissues and during biotic and abiotic stresses. Our analysis also suggests differential accumulation of splice variants of OsSultr1;1 and OsSultr4;1 transcripts during these processes. Apart from known spliced variants, we report an unusual alternative splicing of OsSultr1;1 transcript related to sulphur supply in growth medium and during stress response. Taken together, our study suggests that differential expression and alternative splicing of members of the sulphate transporter family plays an important role in regulating cellular sulphur status required for growth and development and during stress conditions. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms operating to regulate sulphur demand by the plant.
21359958	A novel rice calmodulin-like gene, OsMSR2, enhances drought and salt tolerance and increases ABA sensitivity in Arabidopsis.	2011	Planta	Many abiotic stimuli, such as drought and salt stresses, elicit changes in intracellular calcium levels that serve to convey information and activate adaptive responses. Ca²⁺ signals are perceived by different Ca²⁺ sensors, and calmodulin (CaM) is one of the best-characterized Ca²⁺ sensors in eukaryotes. Calmodulin-like (CML) proteins also exist in plants, but their functions at the physiological and molecular levels are largely unknown. In this report, we present data on OsMSR2 (Oryza sativa L. Multi-Stress-Responsive gene 2), a novel calmodulin-like protein gene isolated from rice Pei'ai 64S (Oryza sativa L.). Expression of OsMSR2 was strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of stresses, including cold, drought, and heat in different tissues at different developmental stages of rice, as revealed by both microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. Analysis of the recombinant OsMSR2 protein demonstrated its potential ability to bind Ca²⁺ in vitro. Expression of OsMSR2 conferred enhanced tolerance to high salt and drought in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accompanied by altered expression of stress/ABA-responsive genes. Transgenic plants also exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA during the seed germination and post-germination stages. The results suggest that expression of OsMSR2 modulated salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis through ABA-mediated pathways.
21676173	A transgenic study on affecting potato tuber yield by expressing the rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT5Z and OsSUT2M.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	In many plants, sucrose transporters are essential for both sucrose exports from sources and imports into sinks, indicating a function in assimilate partitioning. To investigate whether sucrose transporters can improve the yield of starch plant, potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Désirée) were transformed with cDNAs of the rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT5Z and OsSUT2M under the control of a tuber-specific, class-I patatin promoter. Compared to the controls, the average fructose content of OsSUT5Z transgenic tubers significantly increased. However, the content of the sugars and starch in the OsSUT2M transgenic potato tubers showed no obvious difference. Correspondingly, the average tuber yield, average number of tubers per plant and average weight of single tuber showed no significant difference in OsSUT2M transgenic tubers with controls. In the OsSUT5Z transgenic lines, the average tuber yield per plant was 1.9-fold higher than the controls, and the average number of tubers per plant increased by more than 10 tubers on average, whereas the average weight of a single tuber did not increase significantly. These results suggested that the average number of tubers per plant showed more contribution than the average weight of a single tuber to the tuber yield per plant.
21673515	DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Small RNAs are riboregulators that play critical roles in eukaryotic cells. They repress gene expression by acting either on DNA to guide sequence elimination and chromatin remodeling, or on RNA to guide cleavage and translation repression. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa contain four and six DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes with specialized functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. We recently profiled genome-wide gene expression in egg and synergid cells in rice. In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell. In addition, we revealed that AtDCL2 is also preferentially expressed in the Arabidopsis egg cell. These findings suggest that small RNA pathways are activated in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis. The activation of these pathways in the egg cell might be essential for egg cell maturation, fertilization, or embryogenesis.
21760907	Altered levels of histone deacetylase OsHDT1 affect differential gene expression patterns in hybrid rice.	2011	PLoS One	Hybrids between different inbred varieties display novel patterns of gene expression resulted from parental variation in allelic nucleotide sequences. To study the function of chromatin regulators in hybrid gene expression, the histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1 whose expression displayed a circadian rhythm was over-expressed or inactivated by RNAi in an elite rice parent. Increased OsHDT1 expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid. Nonadditive up-regulation of key flowering time genes was found to be related to flowering time of the hybrid. Over-expression of OsHDT1 repressed the nonadditive expression of the key flowering repressors in the hybrid (i.e. OsGI and Hd1) inducing early flowering. Analysis of histone acetylation suggested that OsHDT1 over-expression might promote deacetylation on OsGI and Hd1 chromatin during the peak expression phase. High throughput differential gene expression analysis revealed that altered OsHDT1 levels affected nonadditive expression of many genes in the hybrid. These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that OsHDT1 level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that OsHDT1 may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression.
21220781	Spatial expression and regulation of rice high-affinity nitrate transporters by nitrogen and carbon status.	2011	J Exp Bot	The high affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition because, even under flooded anaerobic cultivation when NH(4)(+) dominates, significant nitrification occurs on the root surface. In the rice genome, four NRT2 and two NAR2 genes encoding HATS components have been identified. One gene OsNRT2.3 was mRNA spliced into OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b and OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1/2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake. Using promoter-GUS reporter plants and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, it was observed that OsNAR2.1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal cells, differently from the five OsNRT2 genes. OsNAR2.1, OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, and OsNRT2.3a were up-regulated by nitrate and suppressed by NH(4)(+) and high root temperature (37 °C). Expression of all these genes was increased by light or external sugar supply. Root transcripts of OsNRT2.3b and OsNRT2.4 were much less abundant and not affected by temperature. Expression of OsNRT2.3b was insensitive to the form of N supply. Expression of OsNRT2.4 responded to changes in auxin supply unlike all the other NRT2 genes. A region from position -311 to -1, relative to the translation start site in the promoter region of OsNAR2.1, was found to contain the cis-element(s) necessary for the nitrate-, but not light- and sugar-dependent activation. However, it was difficult to define a conserved cis-element in the promoters of the nitrate-regulated OsNRT2/OsNAR2 genes. The results imply distinct physiological functions for each OsNRT2 transporter, and differential regulation pathways by N and C status.
21178395	Rice WNK1 is regulated by abiotic stress and involved in internal circadian rhythm.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	In Mammalian system the WNK (with no lysine kinase) serine-threonine protein kinase gene family is suggested to be involved in regulating ion homeostasis and other pathophysiological processes including cancer, hypertension and renal ion transport. In plant system the information about WNK genes is very poor. However, WNK-like genes have also been identified in plants, including ten in Arabidopsis, designated AtWNK1-AtWNK10. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a homologue of AtWNK1 gene from Oryza sativa indica cultivar Pusa Basmati-1 rice and designated as OsWNK1. The specific feature of this gene is lysine residue in kinase subdomain II, which is essential for the coordination of ATP in the active center and conserved among all other kinases, is absent. OsWNK1 was found to respond differentially under various abiotic stresses like cold, heat, salt, drought. OsWNK1 gene showed rhythmic expression profile under diurnal and circadian conditions at the transcription level. Our data indicates that OsWNK1 in rice might play a role in abiotic stress tolerance and that it is involved in internal rhythm.
21148627	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height. Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d-a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day conditions.
21296585	A stress-associated protein containing A20/AN1 zing-finger domains expressed in Medicago truncatula seeds.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	MtSAP1 (Medicago truncatula stress-associated protein 1) was revealed as a down-regulated gene by suppressive subtractive hybridization between two mRNA populations of embryo axes harvested before and after radicle emergence. MtSAP1 is the first gene encoding a SAP with A20 and AN1 zinc-finger domains characterized in M. truncatula. MtSAP1 protein shares 54% and 62% homology with AtSAP7 (Arabidopsis thaliana) and OsiSAP8 (Oryza sativa) respectively, with in particular a strong homology in the A20 and AN1 conserved domains. MtSAP1 gene expression increased in the embryos during the acquisition of tolerance to desiccation, reached its maximum in dry seed and decreased dramatically during the first hours of imbibition. Abiotic stresses (cold and hypoxia), abscisic acid and desiccation treatments induced MtSAP1 gene expression and protein accumulation in embryo axis, while mild drought stress did not affect significantly its expression. This profile of expression along with the presence of anaerobic response elements and ABRE sequences in the upstream region of the gene is consistent with a role of MtSAP1 in the tolerance of low oxygen availability and desiccation during late stages of seed maturation. Silencing of MtSAP1 by RNA interference (RNAi) showed that the function of the encoded protein is required for adequate accumulation of storage globulin proteins, vicilin and legumin, and for the development of embryos able to achieve successful germination.
21451255	Overexpression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene OsMAPK33 enhances sensitivity to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	J Biosci	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling cascades are activated by extracellular stimuli such as environmental stresses and pathogens in higher eukaryotic plants. To know more about MAPK signalling in plants, aMAPK cDNA clone, OsMAPK33, was isolated from rice. The gene is mainly induced by drought stress. In phylogenetic analysis, OsMAPK33 (Os02g0148100) showed approximately 47-93% identity at the amino acid level with other plant MAPKs. It was found to exhibit organ-specific expression with relatively higher expression in leaves as compared with roots or stems, and to exist as a single copy in the rice genome. To investigate the biological functions of OsMAPK33 in rice MAPK signalling, transgenic rice plants that either overexpressed or suppressed OsMAPK33 were made. Under dehydration conditions, the suppressed lines showed lower osmotic potential compared with that of wild-type plants, suggesting a role of OsMAPK33 in osmotic homeostasis. Nonetheless, the suppressed lines did not display any significant difference in drought tolerance compared with their wild-type plants. With increased salinity, there was still no difference in salt tolerance between OsMAPK33-suppressed lines and their wild-type plants. However, the overexpressing lines showed greater reduction in biomass accumulation and higher sodium uptake into cells, resulting in a lower K+/Na+ ratio inside the cell than that in the wild-type plants and OsMAPK33-suppressed lines. These results suggest that OsMAPK33 could play a negative role in salt tolerance through unfavourable ion homeostasis. Gene expression profiling of OsMAPK33 transgenic lines through rice DNA chip analysis showed that OsMAPK33 altered expression of genes involved in ion transport. Further characterization of downstream components will elucidate various biological functions of this novel rice MAPK.
21127026	Physiological, genetic, and molecular characterization of a high-Cd-accumulating rice cultivar, Jarjan.	2011	J Exp Bot	Cadmium (Cd) in rice is a major source of Cd intake for people on a staple rice diet. The mechanisms underlying Cd accumulation in rice plant are still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the physiology and genetics of Cd transport in a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Jarjan) of rice (Oryza sativa). Jarjan showed 5- to 34-fold higher Cd accumulation in the shoots and grains than the cultivar Nipponbare, when it was grown in either a non-Cd-contaminated or a Cd-contaminated soil. A short-term uptake experiment showed no significant difference in Cd uptake by the roots between the two cultivars. However, Jarjan translocated 49% of the total Cd taken up to the shoots, whereas Nipponbare retained most of the Cd in the roots. In both concentration- and time-dependent experiments, Jarjan showed a superior capacity for root-to-shoot translocation of Cd. These results indicate that the high-Cd-accumulation phenotype in Jarjan results from efficient translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. Genetic analysis using an F(2) population derived from Jarjan and Nipponbare revealed that plants showing high- and low-Cd-accumulation phenotypes segregated in a 1:3 ratio, indicating that high accumulation in Jarjan is controlled by a single recessive gene. Furthermore, we isolated OsHMA3, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan. The OsHMA3 protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function. Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by OsHMA3 is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan.
21266036	ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE family in plants: lineage-specific expansion in monocotyledons and conserved genomic and expression features among rice (Oryza sativa) paralogs.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Duplications are very common in the evolution of plant genomes, explaining the high number of members in plant gene families. New genes born after duplication can undergo pseudogenization, neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization. Rice is a model for functional genomics research, an important crop for human nutrition and a target for biofortification. Increased zinc and iron content in the rice grain could be achieved by manipulation of metal transporters. Here, we describe the ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE (ZIFL) gene family in plants, and characterize the genomic structure and expression of rice paralogs, which are highly affected by segmental duplication.

RESULTS: Sequences of sixty-eight ZIFL genes, from nine plant species, were comparatively analyzed. Although related to MSF_1 proteins, ZIFL protein sequences consistently grouped separately. Specific ZIFL sequence signatures were identified. Monocots harbor a larger number of ZIFL genes in their genomes than dicots, probably a result of a lineage-specific expansion. The rice ZIFL paralogs were named OsZIFL1 to OsZIFL13 and characterized. The genomic organization of the rice ZIFL genes seems to be highly influenced by segmental and tandem duplications and concerted evolution, as rice genome contains five highly similar ZIFL gene pairs. Most rice ZIFL promoters are enriched for the core sequence of the Fe-deficiency-related box IDE1. Gene expression analyses of different plant organs, growth stages and treatments, both from our qPCR data and from microarray databases, revealed that the duplicated ZIFL gene pairs are mostly co-expressed. Transcripts of OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7, and OsZIFL12 accumulate in response to Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency in roots, two stresses with partially overlapping responses.

CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that ZIFL genes have different evolutionary histories in monocot and dicot lineages. In rice, concerted evolution affected ZIFL duplicated genes, possibly maintaining similar expression patterns between pairs. The enrichment for IDE1 boxes in rice ZIFL gene promoters suggests a role in Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency up-regulation of ZIFL transcripts. Moreover, this is the first description of the ZIFL gene family in plants and the basis for functional studies on this family, which may play important roles in Zn and Fe homeostasis in plants.
15879704	Characterization of an abiotic stress-inducible dehydrin gene, OsDhn1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Mol Cells	A full-length 1.1 kb cDNA, designated Oryza sativa Dehydrin 1 (OsDhn1), was isolated from the seed coat of rice. The deduced protein is hydrophilic and has three K-type and one S-type motifs (SK3-type), indicating that OsDhn1 belongs to the acidic dehydrin family, which includes wheat WCOR410 and Arabidopsis COR47. Expression of OsDhn1 was strongly induced by low temperature as well as by drought. Induction of OsDhn1 by cold stress was clearcut in the roots of seedlings and the epidermis of palea and lemma. OsDhn1 was also up-regulated in UBI::CBF1/DREB1b transgenic plants indicating that it is regulated by the CBF/DREB stress signaling pathway.
16267395	Characterization and transcriptional expression of the alpha-expansin gene family in rice.	2005	Mol Cells	The rice genome contains at least 28 EXPA (alpha-expansin) genes. We have obtained near full-length cDNAs from the previously uncharacterized genes. Analysis of these newly identified clones together with the 12 identified earlier showed that the EXPA genes contain up to two introns and encode proteins of 240 to 291 amino acid residues. The EXPA proteins contain three conserved motifs: eight cysteine residues at the N-terminus, four tryptophan residues at the C-terminus, and a histidine-phenylalanine-aspartate motif in the central region. EXPA proteins could be divided into six groups based on their sequence similarity. Most were strongly induced in two-day-old seedlings and in the roots of one-week-old plants. However, only 14 genes were expressed in the aboveground organs, and their patterns were quite diverse. Transcript levels of EXPA7, 14, 15, 18, 21, and 29 were greater in stems, while EXPA2, 4, 5, 6, and 16 were highly expressed in both stem and sheath but not in leaf blade. EXPA1 is leaf blade-preferential, and EXP9 is leaf sheath-preferential. Most of the root-expressed genes were more strongly expressed in the dividing zone. However, the Group 2 EXPA genes were also strongly expressed in both mature and dividing zones, while EXPA9 was preferentially expressed in the elongation zone. Fourteen EXPA genes were expressed in developing panicles, with some being expressed during most developmental stages, others only as the panicles matured. These diverse expression patterns of EXPA genes suggest that in general they have distinct roles in plant growth and development.

21868603	Hybrid male sterility in rice is due to epistatic interactions with a pollen killer locus.	2011	Genetics	In intraspecific crosses between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies indica and japonica, the hybrid male sterility gene S24 causes the selective abortion of male gametes carrying the japonica allele (S24-j) via an allelic interaction in the heterozygous hybrids. In this study, we first examined whether male sterility is due solely to the single locus S24. An analysis of near-isogenic lines (NIL-F(1)) showed different phenotypes for S24 in different genetic backgrounds. The S24 heterozygote with the japonica genetic background showed male semisterility, but no sterility was found in heterozygotes with the indica background. This result indicates that S24 is regulated epistatically. A QTL analysis of a BC(2)F(1) population revealed a novel sterility locus that interacts with S24 and is found on rice chromosome 2. The locus was named Epistatic Factor for S24 (EFS). Further genetic analyses revealed that S24 causes male sterility when in combination with the homozygous japonica EFS allele (efs-j). The results suggest that efs-j is a recessive sporophytic allele, while the indica allele (EFS-i) can dominantly counteract the pollen sterility caused by S24 heterozygosity. In summary, our results demonstrate that an additional epistatic locus is an essential element in the hybrid sterility caused by allelic interaction at a single locus in rice. This finding provides a significant contribution to our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid sterility and microsporogenesis.
21749035	Characterization of the transgenic rice event TT51-1 and construction of a reference plasmid.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	Transgenic rice TT51-1 (BT63) is an insect resistant strain that was granted for safety certificate in China in 2009. This study characterizes the transgenic event TT51-1 using a GenomeWalker strategy. The organization of the transgenes indicated that the transgenes on two plasmids, pFHBT1 and pGL2RC7, had been integrated at the same locus. The sequence of the event TT51-1 spanned 8725 bp, including a truncated Cry1Ab/Ac cassette, an intact Cry1Ab/Ac cassette, two Amp gene segments, and an Hph gene segment. The 5' and 3' plant flanking sequences were isolated and used to locate the transgenes to chromosome 10 in TT51-1. The isolated TT51-1 fragment and a fragment of the rice PLD gene were integrated into a plasmid vector, to create plasmid pK-TT51 as a calibrator for detecting rice containing TT51-1. Analysis of unknown samples indicated that the reference plasmid was a reliable alternative to TT51-1 genomic DNA.
22077667	The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice.	2012	Plant J	The central structure of the symbiotic association between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is the fungal arbuscule that delivers minerals to the plant. Our earlier transcriptome analyses identified two half-size ABCG transporters that displayed enhanced mRNA levels in mycorrhizal roots. We now show specific transcript accumulation in arbusculated cells of both genes during symbiosis. Presently, arbuscule-relevant factors from monocotyledons have not been reported. Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes. This phenotypic resemblance and phylogenetic analysis suggest functional conservation of STR1 and STR2 across the angiosperms. Malnutrition of the fungus underlying limited arbuscular growth was excluded by the absence of complementation of the str1 phenotype by wild-type nurse plants. Furthermore, plant AM signaling was found to be intact, as arbuscule-induced marker transcript accumulation was not affected in str1 mutants. Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2. However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2. Interestingly, rice STR1 is associated with a cis-natural antisense transcript (antiSTR1). Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice.
16541127	Molecular and functional characterization of sulfiredoxin homologs from higher plants.	2006	Cell Res	By reducing cysteine-sulfinic acid in oxidized peroxiredoxin, sulfiredoxin (Srx) plays an important role in oxidation stress resistance in yeast and human cells. Here, we report the first molecular and functional characterization of Srx homolog from higher plants. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of potential Srx encoding sequences in both monocot and dicot plant species. Putative plant Srx proteins exhibited significant identities to their orthologs from yeast and human, and contained the conserved signature sequence and residues essential for catalysis. However, unlike yeast and human orthologs, plant Srxs were all predicted to possess chloroplast transit peptide in their primary structure. The Srx proteins from Arabidopsis and rice (designated as AtSrx and OsSrx, respectively) complemented functional deficiency of Srx in the SRX1 deletion yeast cells. A GFP fusion protein of AtSrx was targeted to chloroplast in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast. AtSrx transcription occurred in both vegetative and reproductive organs, and the highest transcript level was detected in leaves. Under oxidation stress, AtSrx transcript level was substantially increased, which paralleled with enhanced transcription of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins that have been found essential in maintaining chloroplast redox balance. In addition to oxidation stress, osmotic/water deficit or cold treatments also raised AtSrx transcript level. Consistent with above findings, the knock-out mutant of AtSrx was significantly more susceptible to oxidation stress than wild type Arabidopsis plant. Taken together, the results of this work indicate the existence of functional Srx homolog in higher plants that is essential for plants to cope with oxidation stress.
22019783	Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice.	2011	Nat Genet	Increasing crop yield is one of the most important goals of plant science research. Grain size is a major determinant of grain yield in cereals and is a target trait for both domestication and artificial breeding(1). We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight. GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size. Sequencing of the promoter region in 51 rice accessions from a wide geographic range identified three haplotypes that seem to be associated with grain width. The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2).
22080596	Regulation of compound leaf development in Medicago truncatula by fused compound leaf1, a class M KNOX gene.	2011	Plant Cell	Medicago truncatula is a legume species belonging to the inverted repeat lacking clade (IRLC) with trifoliolate compound leaves. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying development of trifoliolate leaves in legumes remain largely unknown. Here, we report isolation and characterization of fused compound leaf1 (fcl1) mutants of M. truncatula. Phenotypic analysis suggests that FCL1 plays a positive role in boundary separation and proximal-distal axis development of compound leaves. Map-based cloning indicates that FCL1 encodes a class M KNOX protein that harbors the MEINOX domain but lacks the homeodomain. Yeast two-hybrid assays show that FCL1 interacts with a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana BEL1-like proteins with slightly different substrate specificities from the Arabidopsis homolog KNATM-B. Double mutant analyses with M. truncatula single leaflet1 (sgl1) and palmate-like pentafoliata1 (palm1) leaf mutants show that fcl1 is epistatic to palm1 and sgl1 is epistatic to fcl1 in terms of leaf complexity and that SGL1 and FCL1 act additively and are required for petiole development. Previous studies have shown that the canonical KNOX proteins are not involved in compound leaf development in IRLC legumes. The identification of FCL1 supports the role of a truncated KNOX protein in compound leaf development in M. truncatula.
20082138	Molecular characterization of the Arginine decarboxylase gene family in rice.	2010	Transgenic Res	Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) is a key enzyme in plants that converts arginine into putrescine, an important mediator of abiotic stress tolerance. Adc genes have been isolated from a number of dicotyledonous plants but the oat and rice Adc genes are the only representatives of monocotyledonous species described thus far. Rice has a small family of Adc genes, and OsAdc1 expression has been shown to fluctuate under drought and chilling stress. We identified and characterized a second rice Adc gene (OsAdc2) which encodes a 629-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa. An unusual feature of the OsAdc2 gene is the presence of an intron and a short upstream open reading frame in the 5'-UTR. Sequence comparisons showed that OsAdc2 is more closely related to the oat Adc gene than to OsAdc1 or to its dicot homologs, and mRNA analysis showed that the two rice genes are also differently regulated. Whereas OsAdc1 is expressed in leaf, root and stem, OsAdc2 expression is restricted to stem tissue. Protein expression was investigated with specific antibodies against ADC1 and ADC2, corroborating the mRNA data. We discuss the expression profiles of OsAdc1 and OsAdc2 and potential functions for the two corresponding proteins.
21854475	The long and the short of it: SD1 polymorphism and the evolution of growth trait divergence in U.S. weedy rice.	2011	Mol Ecol	Growth-related traits, such as greater height, greater biomass, faster growth rate and early flowering, are thought to enhance competitiveness of agricultural weeds. However, weedy rice, a conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), displays variation for growth traits. In the United States, separately evolved weedy rice groups have been shown to share genomic identity with exotic domesticated cultivars. Through a common garden experiment, we investigated whether growth trait divergence has occurred among U.S. weeds and their putative cultivated progenitors. We also determined polymorphism patterns in the growth candidate gene, SD1, to assess its possible role in the evolution of divergent phenotypes. We found considerable growth trait variation among weed groups, suggesting that growth trait convergence is not evident among weedy populations. Phenotypic divergence of weedy rice from cultivated ancestors is most apparent for flowering time. Introgression of a chromosomal block containing the SD1 allele from tropical japonica, the predominant U.S. rice cultivar, was detected in one weedy rice population and is associated with a change in growth patterns in this group. This study demonstrates the role of introgressive hybridization in evolutionary divergence of an important weed.
21969384	OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) proteins belong to the oligopeptide transporter family and have been implicated in metal transport and homeostasis in different plant species. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) YSL member, OsYSL6. Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition. There was no difference in the concentration of total Mn and other essential metals between the wild-type rice and the knockout line, but the knockout line showed a higher Mn concentration in the leaf apoplastic solution and a lower Mn concentration in the symplastic solution than wild-type rice. OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals. Furthermore, the expression level increased with leaf age. Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots. Heterogolous expression of OsYSL6 in yeast showed transport activity for the Mn-nicotianamine complex but not for the Mn-mugineic acid complex. Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn-nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice.
21963665	LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems.	2011	Plant Cell	Aerial architecture in higher plants is dependent on the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and axillary meristems (AMs). The SAM produces a main shoot and leaf primordia, while AMs are generated at the axils of leaf primordia and give rise to branches and flowers. Therefore, the formation of AMs is a critical step in the construction of plant architecture. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation. LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle. The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage. The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching. LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1. We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation.
21615687	Evolutionary history and complementary selective relaxation of the duplicated PI genes in grasses.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Gene duplication plays an important role in the evolution of organisms by allowing functional innovation and the divergence of duplicate genes. Previous studies found two PI-like genes in grass species, suggesting functional divergence between the paralogous copies. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of two PI genes from major lineages of grasses and other monocot species, and demonstrated that two PI genes (PI1 and PI2) arose from a whole genome duplication that occurred in a common ancestor of extant grasses. Molecular evolutionary analyses at the family and tribal levels found strong purifying selection acting on two genes in grasses, consistent with the conserved class B function of the PI genes. Importantly, we detected different patterns of selective relaxation between the duplicated PI genes although no signature of positive selection was found. Likelihood ratio tests revealed that the ω ratio for M domain is significantly higher in PI1 than in PI2 but that for K domain is significantly higher in PI2 than in PI1. These findings imply that complementary selective relaxation occurs in two PI genes after duplication, and provide additional molecular evidence for the subfunctionalization of the duplicated PI genes in grasses.
19015668	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight.	2008	Cell Res	Grain weight is a major determinant of crop grain yield and is controlled by naturally occurring quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5. To gain a better understanding of how GW5 controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24. In addition, genotyping analyses of 46 rice cultivars revealed that this deletion is highly correlated with the grain-width phenotype, suggesting that the GW5 deletion might have been selected during rice domestication. GW5 encodes a novel nuclear protein of 144 amino acids that is localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that GW5 physically interacts with polyubiquitin in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Together, our results suggest that GW5 represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling rice grain development and suggests that GW5 could serve as a potential tool for high-yield breeding of crops.Cell Research (2008) 18:1199-1209. doi: 10.1038/cr.2008.307; published online 18 November 2008.
22085497	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice Xa3/Xa26 disease-resistance gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and belongs to a multigene family. However, the functions of most genes in this family are unknown.

RESULTS: Here we report that two orthologs of this family, the NRKe from rice variety Nipponbare and 9RKe from variety 93-11 at the RKe locus, have similar functions although they encode different proteins. This pair of orthologs could not mediate resistance to Xoo, but they were transcriptionally induced by raised temperature. Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants. These plants were more sensitive to high temperature shock than wild-type controls. Transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of NRKe and the kinase domain of Xa3/Xa26 developed the same lesion mimics as the NRKe-transgenic plants, whereas transgenic plants carrying another chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of Xa3/Xa26 and the kinase domain of NRKe were free of lesion mimic. All the transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein were susceptible to Xoo.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature. The LRR domain of RKe protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature. The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap.
21726399	Rice WRKY45 plays important roles in fungal and bacterial disease resistance.	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	Plant 'activators', such as benzothiadiazole (BTH), protect plants from various diseases by priming the plant salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway. We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (OsWRKY45), plays a pivotal role in BTH-induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling. Here, we report further functional characterization of WRKY45. Different plant activators vary in their action points, either downstream (BTH and tiadinil) or upstream (probenazole) of SA. Rice resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, induced by both types of plant activator, was markedly reduced in WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice, indicating a universal role for WRKY45 in chemical-induced resistance. Fungal invasion into rice cells was blocked at most attempted invasion sites (pre-invasive defence) in WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) rice. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated within the cell wall underneath invading fungus appressoria or between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, implying a possible role for H(2)O(2) in pre-invasive defence. Moreover, a hypersensitive reaction-like reaction was observed in rice cells, in which fungal growth was inhibited after invasion (post-invasive defence). The two levels of defence mechanism appear to correspond to Type I and II nonhost resistances. The leaf blast resistance of WRKY45-ox rice plants was much higher than that of other known blast-resistant varieties. WRKY45-ox plants also showed strong panicle blast resistance. BTH-induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was compromised in WRKY45-kd rice, whereas WRKY45-ox plants were highly resistant to this pathogen. However, WRKY45-ox plants were susceptible to Rhizoctonia solani. These results indicate the versatility and limitations of the application of this gene.
22500165	Chromosomal Location of HCA1 and HCA2, Hybrid Chlorosis Genes in Rice.	2012	Int J Plant Genomics	MANY POSTZYGOTIC REPRODUCTIVE BARRIER FORMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PLANTS: hybrid weakness, hybrid necrosis, and hybrid chlorosis. In this study, linkage analysis of the genes causing hybrid chlorosis in F(2) generation in rice, HCA1 and HCA2, was performed. HCA1 and HCA2 are located respectively on the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 11. These regions are known to be highly conserved as a duplicated chromosomal segment. The molecular mechanism causing F(2) chlorosis deduced from the location of the two genes was discussed. The possibility of the introgression of the chromosomal segments encompassing HCA1 and/or HCA2 was also discussed from the viewpoint of Indica-Japonica differentiation.
22209874	Short grain1 decreases organ elongation and brassinosteroid response in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	We identified a short-grain mutant (Short grain1 (Sg1) Dominant) via phenotypic screening of 13,000 rice (Oryza sativa) activation-tagged lines. The causative gene, SG1, encodes a protein with unknown function that is preferentially expressed in roots and developing panicles. Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, with wide, dark-green, and erect leaves. However, the endogenous BR level in the SG1 overexpressor (SG1:OX) plants was comparable to the wild type. SG1:OX plants were insensitive to brassinolide in the lamina inclination assay. Therefore, SG1 appears to decrease responses to BRs. Despite shorter organs in the SG1:OX plants, their cell size was not decreased in the SG1:OX plants. Therefore, SG1 decreases organ elongation by decreasing cell proliferation. In contrast to the SG1:OX plants, RNA interference knockdown plants that down-regulated SG1 and a related gene, SG1-LIKE PROTEIN1, had longer grains and internodes in rachis branches than in the wild type. Taken together, these results suggest that SG1 decreases responses to BRs and elongation of organs such as seeds and the internodes of rachis branches through decreased cellular proliferation.
19640724	Biochemical and physiological characterization of a tau class glutathione transferase from rice (Oryza sativa).	None	Plant Physiol Biochem	The classical phase II detoxification glutathione transferases (GSTs) are key metabolic enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to various electrophilic compounds. A tau class GST gene (OsGSTU17) was cloned from rice, which encodes a protein of 223 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 25.18 kDa. The recombinant OsGSTU17 formed a homodimer protein and showed GSH-conjugating activity with various xenobiotics. Kinetic analysis with respect to NBD-Cl as substrate revealed a K(m) of 0.324 mM and V(max) of 0.219 micromol/min per mg of protein. The enzyme had a maximum activity at pH 7.5, and a high thermal stability with 81% of its initial activity at 55 degrees C for 15 min. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Ser15 in the N-terminal domain is a critical catalytic residue, responsible for stabilisation of the thiolate anion of enzyme-bound glutathione. OsGSTU17 mRNA was expressed in different tissues of rice, both above and below ground. The relative transcript levels of OsGSTU17 mRNA varied significantly among the tissues in response to CDNB, hydrogen peroxide and atrazine treatments, indicating the gene has diverse regulation mechanisms in response to abiotic stresses.
14623941	Interaction between two auxin-resistant mutants and their effects on lateral root formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2003	J Exp Bot	Since root elongation is very sensitive to auxin, screening for reduced inhibition in root elongation has been an important method for the detection of auxin-resistant mutants. Two recessive auxin-resistant lines of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cv. IR8), arm1 and arm2, have been isolated by screening for resistance to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). arm1 displays a variety of morphological defects including reduced lateral root formation, increased seminal root elongation, reduced root diameter, and impaired xylem development in roots, while the arm2 phenotype is almost similar to wild-type IR8 except for a slightly reduced lateral root formation, impaired xylem development in roots and an enhanced plant height. Although the growth of arm2 roots exhibited a resistance to 2,4-D, it was sensitive to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) as the wild type. At the same time, the arm2 roots showed a reduced [14C]2,4-D uptake while uptake of [3H]NAA was normal, suggesting that the resistance to 2,4-D of arm2 roots is due to a defect in 2,4-D uptake. To investigate the possible interaction between arm1 and arm2 genes, a double mutant has been constructed. The roots of arm1 arm2 double mutant were more resistant to 2,4-D and formed fewer lateral roots than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the two genes show synergistic effects with respect to both auxin response and lateral root formation. By contrast, all these mutants displayed the normal gravitropic response in roots, as did the wild-type plants. Taken together, Arm1 and Arm2 genes seem to function in different processes in the auxin-response pathways leading to lateral root formation.
10965944	Organ and cellular localization of asparagine synthetase in rice plants.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	DNA gel blot analysis suggested that asparagine synthetase (AS; EC 6.3.5.4) occurred as a single gene in rice. A fusion protein consisting of 17 kDa tagged-region from pET32a(+) expression plasmid and 42 kDa N-terminal region of rice AS was first expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting polypeptide was purified and a mono-specific antibody for rice AS was prepared after affinity-purification with the antigen. Immunoblotting revealed a high content of AS protein in the leaf sheath at the second position from the fully expanded top leaf and in grains at the middle stage of ripening. Accumulation of mRNA for AS was also observed in these organs. During the ripening of the spikelets, the AS protein contents increased during the first 21 days after flowering, then declined rapidly. Immunolocalization analysis revealed signals for AS protein in the companion cells of vascular bundles of leaf sheath and phloem-parenchyma cells, nucellar projection, and nucellar epidermis of dorsal vascular bundles of grains.
21171885	Molecular mapping of the new blast resistance genes Pi47 and Pi48 in the durably resistant local rice cultivar Xiangzi 3150.	2011	Phytopathology	The indica rice cultivar Xiangzi 3150 (XZ3150) confers a high level of resistance to 95% of the isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae (the agent of rice blast disease) collected in Hunan Province, China. To identify the resistance (R) gene(s) controlling the high level of resistance in this cultivar, we developed 286 F(9) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between XZ3150 and the highly susceptible cultivar CO39. Inoculation of the RILs and an F(2) population from a cross between the two cultivars with the avirulent isolate 193-1-1 in the growth chamber indicated the presence of two dominant R genes in XZ3150. A linkage map with 134 polymorphic simple sequence repeat and single feature polymorphism markers was constructed with the genotype data of the 286 RILs. Composite interval mapping (CIM) using the results of 193-1-1 inoculation showed that two major R genes, designated Pi47 and Pi48, were located between RM206 and RM224 on chromosome 11, and between RM5364 and RM7102 on chromosome 12, respectively. Interestingly, the CIM analysis of the four resistant components of the RILs to the field blast population revealed that Pi47 and Pi48 were also the major genetic factors responsible for the field resistance in XZ3150. The DNA markers linked to the new R genes identified in this study should be useful for further fine mapping, gene cloning, and marker-aided breeding of blast-resistant rice cultivars.
22128137	A reevaluation of rice mitochondrial evolution based on the complete sequence of male-fertile and male-sterile mitochondrial genomes.	2012	Plant Physiol	Plant mitochondrial genomes have features that distinguish them radically from their animal counterparts: a high rate of rearrangement, of uptake and loss of DNA sequences, and an extremely low point mutation rate. Perhaps the most unique structural feature of plant mitochondrial DNAs is the presence of large repeated sequences involved in intramolecular and intermolecular recombination. In addition, rare recombination events can occur across shorter repeats, creating rearrangements that result in aberrant phenotypes, including pollen abortion, which is known as cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Using next-generation sequencing, we pyrosequenced two rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial genomes that belong to the indica subspecies. One genome is normal, while the other carries the wild abortive-CMS. We find that numerous rearrangements in the rice mitochondrial genome occur even between close cytotypes during rice evolution. Unlike maize (Zea mays), a closely related species also belonging to the grass family, integration of plastid sequences did not play a role in the sequence divergence between rice cytotypes. This study also uncovered an excellent candidate for the wild abortive-CMS-encoding gene; like most of the CMS-associated open reading frames that are known in other species, this candidate was created via a rearrangement, is chimeric in structure, possesses predicted transmembrane domains, and coopted the promoter of a genuine mitochondrial gene. Our data give new insights into rice mitochondrial evolution, correcting previous reports.
21621742	A Pid3 allele from rice cultivar Gumei2 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2011	J Genet Genomics	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases. Using map-based strategy and in silico approach we isolated a new rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated Pi25, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2. Over-expression analysis and complementation test showed that Pi25 conferred blast resistance to M. oryzae isolate js001-20. Sequence analysis showed that Pi25 was an intronless gene of 2,772 nucleotides with single nucleotide substitution in comparison to Pid3 at the nucleotide position 459 and predicatively encoded a typical coiled coil--nucleotide binding site--leucine rich repeat (CC--NBS--LRR) protein of 924 amino acid residuals with 100% identity to Pid3 putative protein. The susceptible allele pi25 in Nipponbare contained a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2,209 resulting in a truncated protein with 736 amino acid residuals. In addition, 14 nucleotide substitutions resulting in 10 amino acid substitutions were identified between Pi25 and pi25 upstream the premature stop codon in the susceptible allele. Although the mechanism of Pi25/Pid3-mediated resistance needs to be further investigated, the isolation of the allele would facilitate the utilization of Pi25/Pid3 in rice blast resistance breeding program via transgenic approach and marker assisted selection.
21954164	Association between seed dormancy and pericarp color is controlled by a pleiotropic gene that regulates abscisic acid and flavonoid synthesis in weedy red rice.	2011	Genetics	Seed dormancy has been associated with red grain color in cereal crops for a century. The association was linked to qSD7-1/qPC7, a cluster of quantitative trait loci for seed dormancy/pericarp color in weedy red rice. This research delimited qSD7-1/qPC7 to the Os07g11020 or Rc locus encoding a basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor by intragenic recombinants and provided unambiguous evidence that the association arises from pleiotropy. The pleiotropic gene expressed in early developing seeds promoted expression of key genes for biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), resulting in an increase in accumulation of the dormancy-inducing hormone; activated a conserved network of eight genes for flavonoid biosynthesis to produce the pigments in the lower epidermal cells of the pericarp tissue; and enhanced seed weight. Thus, the pleiotropic locus most likely controls the dormancy and pigment traits by regulating ABA and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively. The dormancy effect could be eliminated by a heat treatment, but could not be completely overcome by gibberellic acid or physical removal of the seed maternal tissues. The dormancy-enhancing alleles differentiated into two groups basically associated with tropical and temperate ecotypes of weedy rice. Of the pleiotropic effects, seed dormancy could contribute most to the weed adaptation. Pleiotropy prevents the use of the dormancy gene to improve resistance of white pericarp cultivars against pre-harvest sprouting through conventional breeding approaches.
22151303	XIAO is involved in the control of organ size by contributing to the regulation of signaling and homeostasis of brassinosteroids and cell cycling in rice.	2012	Plant J	Organ size is determined by cell number and size, and involves two fundamental processes: cell proliferation and cell expansion. Although several plant hormones are known to play critical roles in shaping organ size by regulating the cell cycle, it is not known whether brassinosteroids (BRs) are also involved in regulating cell division. Here we identified a rice T-DNA insertion mutant for organ size, referred to as xiao, that displays dwarfism and erect leaves, typical BR-related phenotypes, together with reduced seed setting. XIAO is predicted to encode an LRR kinase. The small stature of the xiao mutant resulted from reduced organ sizes due to decreased cell numbers resulting from reduced cell division rate, as supported by the observed co-expression of XIAO with a number of genes involved in cell cycling. The xiao mutant displayed a tissue-specific enhanced BR response and greatly reduced BR contents at the whole-plant level. These results indicated that XIAO is a regulator of BR signaling and cell division. Thus, XIAO may provide a possible connection between BRs and cell-cycle regulation in controlling organ growth.
21813465	How MIKC* MADS-box genes originated and evidence for their conserved function throughout the evolution of vascular plant gametophytes.	2012	Mol Biol Evol	Land plants have a remarkable life cycle that alternates between a diploid sporophytic and a haploid gametophytic generation, both of which are multicellular and changed drastically during evolution. Classical MIKC MADS-domain (MIKCC) transcription factors are famous for their role in sporophytic development and are considered crucial for its evolution. About the regulation of gametophyte development, in contrast, little is known. Recent evidence indicated that the closely related MIKC* MADS-domain proteins are important for the functioning of the Arabidopsis thaliana male gametophyte (pollen). Furthermore, also in bryophytes, several MIKC* genes are expressed in the haploid generation. Therefore, that MIKC* genes have a similar role in the evolution of the gametophytic phase as MIKCC genes have in the sporophyte is a tempting hypothesis. To get a comprehensive view of the involvement of MIKC* genes in gametophyte evolution, we isolated them from a broad variety of vascular plants, including the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and representatives of several flowering plant lineages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an extraordinary conservation not found in MIKCC genes. Moreover, expression and interaction studies suggest that a conserved and characteristic network operates in the gametophytes of all tested model organisms. Additionally, we found that MIKC* genes probably evolved from an ancestral MIKCC-like gene by a duplication in the Keratin-like region. We propose that this event facilitated the independent evolution of MIKC* and MIKCC protein networks and argue that whereas MIKCC genes diversified and attained new functions, MIKC* genes retained a conserved role in the gametophyte during land plant evolution.

21807436	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO) and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR) catalyze key steps in chlorophyll degradation by opening the porphyrin macrocycle of pheophorbide a and forming the primary non-photoreactive fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite. These genes strongly participate in senescence and reportedly involved in plants' responses to physical wounding and pathogens. In this report, a single PAO gene (OsPAO) and two RCCR genes (OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2) have been isolated from rice. Expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR or quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment. RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves (especially dark-induced senescent leaves) and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards, even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation. While, knockdown of OsRCCR1 resulted in lesion-mimic spots generation in older leaves which died off early in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses.
21880027	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice.	2011	Plant J	A number of plant species, including rice, secretes citrate from roots in response to Al stress. Here we characterized the functions of a gene, OsFRDL4 (Os01g0919100) that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family in rice (Oryza sativa). Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocyte showed that the OsFRDL4 protein was able to transport citrate and was activated by Al. The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure. Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance. Transient expression of OsFRDL4 in onion epidermal cells showed that it localized to the plasma membrane. Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip. These expression patterns and cell specificity of localization of OsFRDL4 are different from other MATE members identified previously. Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance. Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice.
21249367	Comparative characterization, expression pattern and function analysis of the 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase gene family in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) belong to the old yellow enzyme family of flavoenzymes and form multiple subfamilies in angiosperm plants. In our previous study, a comparative genomic analysis showed that five OPR subfamilies (subs. I-V) occur in monocots, and two subfamilies (subs. I and II) in dicots. Here, a comparative study of five OsOPR genes, representing five subfamilies (I-V) in rice, was performed to provide insights into OPR biochemical properties and physiological importance. Comparative analysis of the three-dimensional structure by homology modeling indicated all five OsOPR proteins contained a highly conserved backbone with (α/β)(8)-barrels, while two middle variable regions (MVR i and ii) were also detected and defined. Analysis of enzymatic characteristics revealed that all five OsOPR fusion proteins exhibit distinct substrate specificity. Different catalytic activity was observed using racemic OPDA and trans-2-hexen-1-al as substrates, suggesting OsOPR family genes participate in two main branches of the octadecanoid pathway, including the allene oxide synthase and hydroperoxide lyase pathways which regulate various developmental processes and/or defense responses. The transcript profiles of five OsOPR genes exhibited strong tissue-specific and inducible expression patterns under abiotic stress, hormones and plant wounding treatments. Furthermore, the transcriptions of OsOPR04-1 (OsOPR11) and OsOPR08-1 (OsOPR7), representing subs. I and II, respectively, were observed in all six selected tissues and with all above-stress treatments. This suggests that these two subfamilies play an important role during different developmental stages and in response to stresses; while the expressions of OsOPR06-1 (OsOPR6), OsOPR01-1 (OsOPR10) and OsOPR02-1 (OsOPR8), representing subs. III, IV and V respectively, were strongly up-regulated with abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) treatments in roots, suggesting these three subfamilies play an important role in responding to hormones especially ABA and IAA signals in roots.
21625436	NOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis and Rubisco formation in rice.	2011	PLoS One	NITRIC OXIDE-ASSOCIATED1 (NOA1) encodes a circularly permuted GTPase (cGTPase) known to be essential for ribosome assembly in plants. While the reduced chlorophyll and Rubisco phenotypes were formerly noticed in both NOA1-suppressed rice and Arabidopsis, a detailed insight is still necessary. In this study, by using RNAi transgenic rice, we further demonstrate that NOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll and Rubisco levels. When plants were grown at 30°C, the chlorophyll and Rubisco levels in OsNOA1-silenced plants were only slightly lower than those in WT. However, at 22°C, the silenced plants accumulated far less chlorophyll and Rubisco than WT. It was further revealed that the regulation of chlorophyll and Rubisco occurs at the anabolic level. Etiolated WT seedlings restored chlorophyll and Rubisco accumulations readily once returned to light, at either 30°C or 15°C. Etiolated OsNOA1-silenced plants accumulated chlorophyll and Rubisco to normal levels only at 30°C, and lost this ability at low temperature. On the other hand, de-etiolated OsNOA1-silenced seedlings maintained similar levels of chlorophyll and Rubisco as WT, even after being shifted to 15°C for various times. Further expression analyses identified several candidate genes, including OsPorA (NADPH: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A), OsrbcL (Rubisco large subunit), OsRALyase (Ribosomal RNA apurinic site specific lyase) and OsPuf4 (RNA-binding protein of the Puf family), which may be involved in OsNOA1-regulated chlorophyll biosynthesis and Rubisco formation. Overall, our results suggest OsNOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis, Rubisco formation and plastid development in rice.
21309868	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice.	2011	Plant J	Root hair growth requires intensive cell-wall modification. This study demonstrates that root hair-specific expansin As, a sub-clade of the cell wall-loosening expansin proteins, are required for root hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified a gene encoding EXPA17 (OsEXPA17) from a rice mutant with short root hairs. Promoter::reporter transgenic lines exhibited exclusive OsEXPA17 expression in root hair cells. The OsEXPA17 mutant protein (OsexpA17) contained a point mutation, causing a change in the amino acid sequence (Gly104→Arg). This amino acid alteration is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved disulfide bond in the mutant. Suppression of OsEXPA17 by RNA interference further confirmed requirement for the gene in root hair elongation. Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots. These results demonstrate that members of the root hair EXPA sub-clade play a crucial role in root hair cell elongation in Graminaceae.
21497713	Overexpression of OsRDCP1, a rice RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, increased tolerance to drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Plant Sci	CaRma1H1 was previously identified as a hot pepper drought-induced RING E3 Ub ligase. We have identified five putative proteins that display a significant sequence identity with CaRma1H1 in the rice genome database (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/RiceGE). These five rice paralogs possess a single RING motif in their N-terminal regions, consistent with the notion that RING proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family. Therefore, these proteins were named OsRDCPs (Oryza sativa RING domain-containing proteins). Among these paralogs, OsRDCP1 was induced by drought stress, whereas the other OsRDCP members were constitutively expressed, with OsRDCP4 transcripts expressed at the highest level in rice seedlings. osrdcp1 loss-of-function knockout mutant and OsRDCP1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants were developed. Phenotypic analysis showed that wild-type plants and the homozygous osrdcp1 G2 mutant line displayed similar phenotypes under normal growth conditions and in response to drought stress. This may be due to complementation by other OsRDCP paralogs. In contrast, 35S:OsRDCP1 T2 transgenic rice plants exhibited improved tolerance to severe water deficits. Although the physiological function of OsRDCP1 remains unclear, there are several possible mechanisms for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration stress in rice plants.
21153026	Isolation and characterization of a rice glutathione S-transferase gene promoter regulated by herbicides and hormones.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	OsGSTL2, encoding glutathione S-transferase, is a lambda class gene on chromosome 3 of rice (Oryza sativa L.). RNA blot analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that the transcription of OsGSTL2 in rice roots treated with chlorsulfuron increased significantly. To further understand OsGSTL2 promoter activity, a DNA fragment (GST2171) of 2,171 bp upstream of the OsGSTL2 coding region was isolated. In silico sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains stress-regulated regulatory elements, hormone-responsive elements and three transposable elements. To define the core promoter sequence, a series of 5' truncation derivatives of GST2171 were fused to uidA gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into rice plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The expression of the GST2171::GUS transgene varied considerably. GUS staining indicated that the uidA gene is expressed in young seedlings, older leaves, flowering glumes and seeds, but not in older roots. Quantitative fluorescence assays revealed that the expression of the uidA gene is strong in young seedlings and decreases gradually over a period of 25 days. To our surprise, among the 5' truncation derivatives, the shortest promoter GST525 showed the highest GUS expression, and the second shortest promoter GST962 showed the lowest GUS expression. The uidA gene expression in the roots of transgenic rice seedlings is upregulated by chlorsulfuron, glyphosate, salicylic acid (SA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The possible roles of the repetitive elements on the OsGSTL2 promoter were discussed in terms of transcription repression and promoter induction by herbicides and hormones.
21332845	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant J	Jasmonates play important roles in development, stress responses and defense in plants. Here, we report the results of a study using a functional genomics approach that identified a rice basic helix-loop-helix domain gene, OsbHLH148, that conferred drought tolerance as a component of the jasmonate signaling module in rice. OsbHLH148 transcript levels were rapidly increased by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or abscisic acid, and abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity, low temperature and wounding. Transgenic over-expression of OsbHLH148 in rice confers plant tolerance to drought stress. Expression profiling followed by DNA microarray and RNA gel-blot analyses of transgenic versus wild-type rice identified genes that are up-regulated by OsbHLH148 over-expression. These include OsDREB and OsJAZ genes that are involved in stress responses and the jasmonate signaling pathway, respectively. OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine. Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex. The transcription level of OsJAZ1 increased upon exposure of rice to MeJA. These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance. Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate-regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148-OsJAZ-OsCOI1 signaling module in rice.
21255162	Metabolomics data reveal a crucial role of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;1 in coordinating metabolic balance in rice.	2011	Plant J	Rice plants grown in paddy fields preferentially use ammonium as a source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyses the conversion of ammonium to glutamine. Of the three genes encoding cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 is critical for normal growth and grain filling. However, the basis of its physiological function that may alter the rate of nitrogen assimilation and carbon metabolism within the context of metabolic networks remains unclear. To address this issue, we carried out quantitative comparative analyses between the metabolite profiles of a rice mutant lacking OsGS1;1 and its background wild type (WT). The mutant plants exhibited severe retardation of shoot growth in the presence of ammonium compared with the WT. Overaccumulation of free ammonium in the leaf sheath and roots of the mutant indicated the importance of OsGS1;1 for ammonium assimilation in both organs. The metabolite profiles of the mutant line revealed: (i) an imbalance in levels of sugars, amino acids and metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and (ii) overaccumulation of secondary metabolites, particularly in the roots under a continuous supply of ammonium. Metabolite-to-metabolite correlation analysis revealed the presence of mutant-specific networks between tryptamine and other primary metabolites in the roots. These results demonstrated a crucial function of OsGS1;1 in coordinating the global metabolic network in rice plants grown using ammonium as the nitrogen source.
21796433	Constitutively and highly expressed Oryza sativa polyamine oxidases localize in peroxisomes and catalyze polyamine back conversion.	2012	Amino Acids	Polyamine oxidases (PAOs) are FAD-dependent enzymes involved in polyamine (PA) catabolism. Recent studies have revealed that plant PAOs are not only active in the terminal catabolism of PAs as demonstrated for maize apoplastic PAO but also in a polyamine back-conversion pathway as shown for most Arabidopsis PAOs. We have characterized Oryza sativa PAOs at molecular and biochemical levels. The rice genome contains 7 PAO isoforms that are termed OsPAO1 to OsPAO7. Of the seven PAOs, OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 transcripts were most abundant in 2-week-old seedlings and mature plants, while OsPAO1, OsPAO2, OsPAO6, and OsPAO7 were expressed at very low levels with different tissue specificities. The more abundantly expressed PAOs--OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5--were cloned, and their gene products were produced in Escherichia coli. The enzymatic activities of the purified OsPAO3 to OsPAO5 proteins were examined. OsPAO3 favored spermidine (Spd) as substrate followed by thermospermine (T-Spm) and spermine (Spm) and showed a full PA back-conversion activity. OsPAO4 substrate specificity was similar to that of OsPAO5 preferring Spm and T-Spm but not Spd. Those enzymes also converted Spm and T-Spm to Spd, again indicative of PA back-conversion activities. Lastly, we show that OsPAO3, OsPAO4, and OsPAO5 are localized in peroxisomes. Together, these data revealed that constitutively and highly expressed O. sativa PAOs are localized in peroxisomes and catalyze PA back-conversion processes.
21737944	The biosynthesis of isoprenoids and the mechanisms regulating it in plants.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Plants synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) via the mevalonate pathway and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. IPP is condensed to its allylic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate, to yield geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a common precursor for the production of cyclic diterpenoids. Studies of subcellular localization and of transgenic plants defective in the enzymes involved in the pathway have revealed that the synthesis processes of plastidic diterpenoids are metabolically separated in the plastids. Ditepenoid phytoalexins are synthesized through the plastidic MEP pathway in rice. The biosynthetic genes responsible for diterpenoid phytoalexins are clustered on the rice chromosomes, and the expression of them was coordinately regulated under stress conditions. Furthermore, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is induced by the fungal chitin oligosaccharide elicitor, was identified as a key regulator of coordinated expression of the clustered biosynthetic genes for phytoalexin production in rice.
21805151	Downregulation of OsPK1, a cytosolic pyruvate kinase, by T-DNA insertion causes dwarfism and panicle enclosure in rice.	2012	Planta	Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step of glycolysis. There are few reports on the role of PK in rice. Here, we identified a novel rice dwarf mutant, designated as ospk1, showing dwarfism, panicle enclosure, reduced seed set, and outgrowth of axillary buds from culm nodes. Sequence analyses of 5'-RACE indicated that a single T-DNA was inserted in the transcriptional regulatory region of OsPK1 in ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR result showed that OsPK1 expression was decreased by approximately 90% in ospk1 compared with that in WT. Enzyme assay and transient expression in protoplasts indicated that OsPK1 encodes a cytosolic PK (PK(c)). Complementation with OsPK1 demonstrated that OsPK1 is responsible for the phenotype of ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR and GUS staining analyses exhibited that OsPK1 was expressed mainly in leaf mesophyll cells, phloem companion cells in stems, and cortical parenchyma cells in roots. The transcriptions of four other putative enzymes involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were altered in ospk1. The amount of pyruvate is decreased in ospk1. We propose that OsPK1 plays an important role through affecting the glycolytic pathway. The contents of glucose and fructose were markedly accumulated in flag leaf blade and panicle of ospk1. The sucrose level in panicle of ospk1 was decreased by approximately 84%. These findings indicated that both monosaccharide metabolism and sugar transport are altered due to the decreased expression of OsPK1. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of PK(c) in plant morphological development, especially plant height.
21807632	Structural characterization and expression pattern analysis of the rice PLT gene family.	2011	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Plethora (PLT) genes encode transcription factors containing AP2-domain, and have been shown to maintain the activity of stem cells and regulate the root development of dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Through genome-wide analysis, 10 OsPLT members were identified in monocot rice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression patterns of these OsPLT genes showed that OsPLTs1-5, OsPLTs7-9, and OsPLT10 were preferentially expressed in root, stem, or seed, respectively, and OsPLT6 was preferentially expressed both in root and seed. Further analysis by in situ hybridization showed that six root-expressed OsPLT genes (1-6) were all expressed in the primodium of crown root, and most of them were expressed in the initial cells adjacent to quiescent center of primary, crown, and lateral roots. In addition, OsPLT genes were regulated by multiple hormones, suggesting that OsPLTs might play an important role in the regulation of hormone-mediated development of main, crown, and lateral roots of rice.
21821426	Characterization of the sulfurtransferase family from Oryza sativa L.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	Sulfurtransferases (Str) comprise a group of enzymes widely distributed in archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryota which catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors. Neither the in vivo sulfur donors nor the acceptors of Str could be clearly identified in any of the organisms investigated so far. In Oryza sativa L. 24 Str (OsStr) encoding genes have been identified and subdivided into six groups according to their sequence homology. To half of the Oryza Str a direct homolog and to 40% at least a similar protein in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. could be allocated. Only the group comprising two-domain Str contains more Oryza Str than Arabidopsis Str. According to EST abundance analysis most of the OsStr mRNAs accumulate in several plant tissues. OsStr22, the homolog to the best characterized Str1 from Arabidopsis (AtStr1), shows the highest expression in middle-aged plants whereas AtStr1 shows the highest expression in senescent plants. Heterologously expressed and purified OsStr22 shows very low enzyme activity in comparison to the Arabidopsis and the Brassica napus L. Str. The data obtained so far constitute the basis to analyze differences among the Str family from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.
21760907	Altered levels of histone deacetylase OsHDT1 affect differential gene expression patterns in hybrid rice.	2011	PLoS One	Hybrids between different inbred varieties display novel patterns of gene expression resulted from parental variation in allelic nucleotide sequences. To study the function of chromatin regulators in hybrid gene expression, the histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1 whose expression displayed a circadian rhythm was over-expressed or inactivated by RNAi in an elite rice parent. Increased OsHDT1 expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid. Nonadditive up-regulation of key flowering time genes was found to be related to flowering time of the hybrid. Over-expression of OsHDT1 repressed the nonadditive expression of the key flowering repressors in the hybrid (i.e. OsGI and Hd1) inducing early flowering. Analysis of histone acetylation suggested that OsHDT1 over-expression might promote deacetylation on OsGI and Hd1 chromatin during the peak expression phase. High throughput differential gene expression analysis revealed that altered OsHDT1 levels affected nonadditive expression of many genes in the hybrid. These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that OsHDT1 level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that OsHDT1 may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression.
21796369	Functional analysis of OsPUT1, a rice polyamine uptake transporter.	2012	Planta	Polyamines are nitrogenous compounds found in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and absolutely essential for cell viability. In plants, they regulate several growth and developmental processes and the levels of polyamines are also correlated with the plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. In plant cells, polyamines are synthesized in plastids and cytosol. This biosynthetic compartmentation indicates that the specific transporters are essential to transport polyamines between the cellular compartments. In the present study, a phylogenetic analysis was used to identify candidate polyamine transporters in rice. A full-length cDNA rice clone AK068055 was heterologously expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spermidine uptake mutant, agp2∆. Radiological uptake and competitive inhibition studies with putrescine indicated that rice gene encodes a protein that functioned as a spermidine-preferential transporter. In competition experiments with several amino acids at 25-fold higher levels than spermidine, only methionine, asparagine, and glutamine were effective in reducing uptake of spermidine to 60% of control rates. Based on those observations, this rice gene was named polyamine uptake transporter 1 (OsPUT1). Tissue-specific expression of OsPUT1 by semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the gene was expressed in all tissues except seeds and roots. Transient expression assays in onion epidermal cells and rice protoplasts failed to localize to a cellular compartment. The characterization of the first plant polyamine transporter sets the stage for a systems approach that can be used to build a model to fully define how the biosynthesis, degradation, and transport of polyamines in plants mediate developmental and biotic responses.
21777365	Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Crop architecture parameters such as tiller number, angle and plant height are important agronomic traits that have been considered for breeding programmes. Auxin distribution within the plant has long been recognized to alter architecture. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains 12 putative PIN genes encoding auxin efflux transporters, including four PIN1 and one PIN2 genes. Here, we report that over-expression of OsPIN2 through a transgenic approach in rice (Japonica cv. Nipponbare) led to a shorter plant height, more tillers and a larger tiller angle when compared with wild type (WT). The expression patterns of the auxin reporter DR5::GUS and quantification of auxin distribution showed that OsPIN2 over-expression increased auxin transport from the shoot to the root-shoot junction, resulting in a non-tissue-specific accumulation of more free auxin at the root-shoot junction relative to WT. Over-expression of OsPIN2 enhanced auxin transport from shoots to roots, but did not alter the polar auxin pattern in the roots. Transgenic plants were less sensitive to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, than WT in their root growth. OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice. The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture. Altering OsPIN2 expression by genetic transformation can be directly used for modifying rice architecture.
21734114	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Physiol	Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase (FNR) mediates electron transfer between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(+); therefore, it is a key enzyme that provides the reducing power used in the Calvin cycle. Other than FNR, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase also accept electrons from Fd, an electron carrier protein in the stroma. Therefore, the regulation of electron partitioning in the chloroplast is important for photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. The regulatory mechanism of electron partitioning, however, remains to be elucidated. We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them. Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions. On the other hand, OsLFNR2 expression led to the impairment of photosynthetic linear electron transport as well as Fd-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of two LFNR isoforms plays an important role in electron partitioning between carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation.
21804028	Molecular distinction in genetic regulation of nonphotochemical quenching in rice.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) regulates energy conversion in photosystem II and protects plants from photoinhibition. Here we analyze NPQ capacity in a number of rice cultivars. NPQ was strongly induced under medium and high light intensities in rice leaves. Japonica cultivars generally showed higher NPQ capacities than Indica cultivars when we measured a rice core collection. We mapped NPQ regulator and identified a locus (qNPQ1-2) that seems to be responsible for the difference in NPQ capacity between Indica and Japonica. One of the two rice PsbS homologues (OsPsbS1) was found within the qNPQ1-2 region. PsbS protein was not accumulated in the leaf blade of the mutant harboring transferred DNA insertion in OsPsbS1. NPQ capacity increased as OsPsbS1 expression increased in a series of transgenic lines ectopically expressing OsPsbS1 in an Indica cultivar. Indica cultivars lack a 2.7-kb region at the point 0.4 kb upstream of the OsPsbS1 gene, suggesting evolutionary discrimination of this gene.
21756975	Rice OsERG3 encodes an unusual small C2-domain protein containing a Ca(2+)-binding module but lacking phospholipid-binding properties.	2011	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: The C2 domain is a Ca(2+)/phospholipid-binding motif found in many proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. OsERG3 is a homolog of OsERG1, a gene encoding a small C2-domain protein in rice.

METHODS: OsERG3 Ca(2+)-binding and phospholipid-binding assays were carried out using (3)H-labeled phospholipid liposomes and a (45)Ca(2+) overlay assay, respectively. Cytosolic expression of OsERG3 was investigated by Western blot analysis and the OsERG3::smGFP transient expression assay.

RESULTS: OsERG3 transcript levels were greatly enhanced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and Ca(2+)-ionophore. OsERG3 protein proved unable to interact with phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca(2+) ions. Nonetheless, OsERG3 displayed calcium-binding activity in an in vitro(45)Ca(2+)-binding assay, a property not observed with OsERG1. The cytosolic location of OsERG3 was not altered by the presence of fungal elicitor or Ca(2+)-ionophore.

CONCLUSIONS: OsERG3 encodes a small C2-domain protein consisting of a single C2 domain. OsERG3 binds Ca(2+) ions but not phospholipids. OsERG3 is a cytosolic soluble protein. The OsERG3 gene may play a role in signaling pathway involving Ca(2+) ions.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The data demonstrate that OsERG3 is an unusual small C2-domain protein containing a Ca(2+)-binding module but lacking phospholipid-binding properties.
21804566	14-3-3 proteins act as intracellular receptors for rice Hd3a florigen.	2011	Nature	'Florigen' was proposed 75 years ago to be synthesized in the leaf and transported to the shoot apex, where it induces flowering. Only recently have genetic and biochemical studies established that florigen is encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a gene that is universally conserved in higher plants. Nonetheless, the exact function of florigen during floral induction remains poorly understood and receptors for florigen have not been identified. Here we show that the rice FT homologue Hd3a interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in the apical cells of shoots, yielding a complex that translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Oryza sativa (Os)FD1 transcription factor, a rice homologue of Arabidopsis thaliana FD. The resultant ternary 'florigen activation complex' (FAC) induces transcription of OsMADS15, a homologue of A. thaliana APETALA1 (AP1), which leads to flowering. We have determined the 2.4 Å crystal structure of rice FAC, which provides a mechanistic basis for florigen function in flowering. Our results indicate that 14-3-3 proteins act as intracellular receptors for florigen in shoot apical cells, and offer new approaches to manipulate flowering in various crops and trees.
21631533	Role of peroxidases in the compensation of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase knockdown in rice plants under abiotic stress.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Current studies, particularly in Arabidopsis, have demonstrated that mutants deficient in cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (APXs) are susceptible to the oxidative damage induced by abiotic stress. In contrast, we demonstrate here that rice mutants double silenced for cytosolic APXs (APx1/2s) up-regulated other peroxidases, making the mutants able to cope with abiotic stress, such as salt, heat, high light and methyl viologen, similar to non-transformed (NT) plants. The APx1/2s mutants exhibited an altered redox homeostasis, as indicated by increased levels of H₂O₂ and ascorbate and glutathione redox states. Both mutant and NT plants exhibited similar photosynthesis (CO₂) assimilation and photochemical efficiency) under both normal and stress conditions. Overall, the antioxidative compensatory mechanism displayed by the mutants was associated with increased expression of OsGpx genes, which resulted in higher glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in the cytosolic and chloroplastic fractions. The transcript levels of OsCatA and OsCatB and the activities of catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD; type III peroxidases) were also up-regulated. None of the six studied isoforms of OsApx were up-regulated under normal growth conditions. Therefore, the deficiency in cytosolic APXs was effectively compensated for by up-regulation of other peroxidases. We propose that signalling mechanisms triggered in rice mutants could be distinct from those proposed for Arabidopsis.
21753117	OsPHF1 regulates the plasma membrane localization of low- and high-affinity inorganic phosphate transporters and determines inorganic phosphate uptake and translocation in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) is known to regulate the plasma membrane localization of PHT1;1, a high-affinity inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). OsPHF1, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene homologous to AtPHF1, was isolated and found to regulate the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters to the plasma membrane. Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one-point mutations at the fifth WD-repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation. The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8. Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2. However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2. Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi-supplied condition. These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low- and high-affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice. The similar function of PHF1 required to facilitate PHT1 transit through the endoplasmic reticulum between Arabidopsis and rice provides an example of expectations from what one would deduce from sequence comparisons to extend knowledge from Arabidopsis to crops.
21795261	Genome-wide identification, classification, and expression analysis of autophagy-associated gene homologues in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	DNA Res	Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process for recycling macromolecules and organelles. It plays important roles in plant development and in response to nutritional demand, stress, and senescence. Organisms from yeast to plants contain many autophagy-associated genes (ATG). In this study, we found that a total of 33 ATG homologues exist in the rice [Oryza sativa L. (Os)] genome, which were classified into 13 ATG subfamilies. Six of them are alternatively spliced genes. Evolutional analysis showed that expansion of 10 OsATG homologues occurred via segmental duplication events and that the occurrence of these OsATG homologues within each subfamily was asynchronous. The Ka/Ks ratios suggested purifying selection for four duplicated OsATG homologues and positive selection for two. Calculating the dates of the duplication events indicated that all duplication events might have occurred after the origin of the grasses, from 21.43 to 66.77 million years ago. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and mining the digital expression database of rice showed that all 33 OsATG homologues could be detected in at least one cell type of the various tissues under normal or stress growth conditions, but their expression was tightly regulated. The 10 duplicated genes showed expression divergence. The expression of most OsATG homologues was regulated by at least one treatment, including hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses, and nutrient limitation. The identification of OsATG homologues showing constitutive expression or responses to environmental stimuli provides new insights for in-depth characterization of selected genes of importance in rice.
18980645	Systematic approaches to using the FOX hunting system to identify useful rice genes.	2009	Plant J	Ectopic gene expression, or the gain-of-function approach, has the advantage that once the function of a gene is known the gene can be transferred to many different plants by transformation. We previously reported a method, called FOX hunting, that involves ectopic expression of Arabidopsis full-length cDNAs in Arabidopsis to systematically generate gain-of-function mutants. This technology is most beneficial for generating a heterologous gene resource for analysis of useful plant gene functions. As an initial model we generated more than 23,000 independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines that expressed rice fl-cDNAs (Rice FOX Arabidopsis lines). The short generation time and rapid and efficient transformation frequency of Arabidopsis enabled the functions of the rice genes to be analyzed rapidly. We screened rice FOX Arabidopsis lines for alterations in morphology, photosynthesis, element accumulation, pigment accumulation, hormone profiles, secondary metabolites, pathogen resistance, salt tolerance, UV signaling, high light tolerance, and heat stress tolerance. Some of the mutant phenotypes displayed by rice FOX Arabidopsis lines resulted from the expression of rice genes that had no homologs in Arabidopsis. This result demonstrated that rice fl-cDNAs could be used to introduce new gene functions in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, these findings showed that rice gene function could be analyzed by employing Arabidopsis as a heterologous host. This technology provides a framework for the analysis of plant gene function in a heterologous host and of plant improvement by using heterologous gene resources.
19762423	A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice.	2009	Development	Although some genes that encode sensory or regulatory elements for photoperiodic flowering are conserved between the long-day (LD) plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the short-day (SD) plant rice, the gene networks that control rice flowering, and particularly flowering under LD conditions, are not well understood. We show here that RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), the closest homolog to Heading date 3a (Hd3a), is a major floral activator under LD conditions. An RFT1:GFP fusion protein localized in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) under LD conditions, suggesting that RFT1 is a florigen gene in rice. Furthermore, mutants in OsMADS50, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis SUPPRESOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) did not flower up to 300 days after sowing under LD conditions, indicating that OsMADS50, which acts upstream of RFT1, promotes flowering under LD conditions. We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice. Among these regulators, Ehd1, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions. A rice ortholog of Arabidopsis APETALA1, OsMADS14, was expressed in the floral meristem in wild-type but not in RFT1 RNAi plants, suggesting that OsMADS14 is activated by RFT1 protein in the SAM after the transition to flowering. We have thus exposed a network of genes that regulate LD flowering in rice.
21853042	Characterization of the PRMT gene family in rice reveals conservation of arginine methylation.	2011	PLoS One	Post-translational methylation of arginine residues profoundly affects the structure and functions of protein and, hence, implicated in a myriad of essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), the enzymes catalyzing arginine methylation have been extensively studied in animals, yeast and, to some extent, in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Eight genes coding for the PRMTs were identified in Oryza sativa, previously. Here, we report that these genes show distinct expression patterns in various parts of the plant. In vivo targeting experiment demonstrated that GFP-tagged OsPRMT1, OsPRMT5 and OsPRMT10 were localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas OsPRMT6a and OsPRMT6b were predominantly localized to the nucleus. OsPRMT1, OsPRMT4, OsPRMT5, OsPRMT6a, OsPRMT6b and OsPRMT10 exhibited in vitro arginine methyltransferase activity against myelin basic protein, glycine-arginine-rich domain of fibrillarin and calf thymus core histones. Furthermore, they depicted specificities for the arginine residues in histones H3 and H4 and were classified into type I and Type II PRMTs, based on the formation of type of dimethylarginine in the substrate proteins. The two homologs of OsPRMT6 showed direct interaction in vitro and further titrating different amounts of these proteins in the methyltransferase assay revealed that OsPRMT6a inhibits the methyltransferase activity of OsPRMT6b, probably, by the formation of heterodimer. The identification and characterization of PRMTs in rice suggests the conservation of arginine methylation in monocots and hold promise for gaining further insight into regulation of plant development.
21830109	Fine mapping a major QTL for flag leaf size and yield-related traits in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Leaf size is a major determinant of plant architecture and yield potential in crops. A previous study showed that the genomic region of chromosome 1 contains a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flag leaf size in a set of backcross recombinant inbred lines derived from two elite parental lines (Zhenshan 97 and 93-11). In the present study, the QTL (qFL1) was shown to explain a large proportion of the variation in flag leaf size (leaf length, width and area) in derived populations (BC(2)F(3) and BC(3)F(2)) in multiple environments. Using a large segregating population, we narrowed the location of qFL1 to a 31 kb region containing four predicted genes. Expression of one of these genes, OsFTL1, differed between leaves in near-isogenic lines carrying alleles of Zhenshan 97 and 93-11. qFL1 had a pleiotropic effect on flag leaf size and yield-related traits. Conditional QTL analysis of the derived population (BC(3)F(2)) supports the assertion that qFL1 is the QTL for flag leaf length and exhibits pleiotropy. Pyramiding of qFL1 with two known genes (GS3 and Wx) from 93-11 into Zhenshan 97 enlarged flag leaves, improved grain size and amylose content, and increased yield per plant, but slightly delayed heading date. These results provide a foundation for the functional characterization of the gene underlying the pleiotropic effects of qFL1 and for genetic improvement of the plant architecture and yield potential of rice.
21883553	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance.	2012	Plant J	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) regulate the downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (OsCPK12) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses. OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) in the leaves was less in OsCPK12-OX plants than in wild-type (WT) plants. Genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes (OsAPx2 and OsAPx8) were more highly expressed in OsCPK12-OX plants than in WT plants, whereas the expression of the NADPH oxidase gene, OsrbohI, was decreased in OsCPK12-OX plants compared with WT plants. Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants. The level of H(2) O(2) accumulation was greater in oscpk12 and OsCPK12 RNAi plants than in the WT. These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS. We also observed that OsCPK12-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance.
21729241	Binding affinities and interactions among different heat shock element types and heat shock factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	FEBS J	Binding of heat shock factors (Hsfs) to heat shock elements (HSEs) leads to transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes. Genome-wide, 953 rice genes contain perfect-type, 695 genes gap-type and 1584 genes step-type HSE sequences in their 1-kb promoter region. The rice genome contains 13 class A, eight class B and four class C Hsfs (OsHsfs) and has OsHsf26 (which is of variant type) genes. Chemical cross-linking analysis of in vitro synthesized OsHsf polypeptides showed formation of homotrimers of OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA9 and OsHsfB4b proteins. Binding analysis of polypeptides with oligonucleotide probes containing perfect-, gap-, and step-type HSE sequences showed that OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA9 and OsHsfB4b differentially recognize various model HSEs as a function of varying reaction temperatures. The homomeric form of OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b proteins was further noted by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach in onion epidermal cells. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsHsfB4b showed homomeric interaction as well as distinct heteromeric interactions with OsHsfA2a, OsHsfA7, OsHsfB4c and OsHsf26. Transactivation activity was noted in OsHsfA2c, OsHsfA2d, OsHsfA9, OsHsfC1a and OsHsfC1b in yeast cells. These differential patterns pertaining to binding with HSEs and protein-protein interactions may have a bearing on the cellular functioning of OsHsfs under a range of different physiological and environmental conditions.
21831212	An EAR-motif-containing ERF transcription factor affects herbivore-induced signaling, defense and resistance in rice.	2011	Plant J	Ethylene responsive factors (ERFs) are a large family of plant-specific transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of plant development and stress responses. However, little to nothing is known about their role in herbivore-induced defense. We discovered a nucleus-localized ERF gene in rice (Oryza sativa), OsERF3, that was rapidly up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis. Antisense and over-expression of OsERF3 revealed that it positively affects transcript levels of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and two WRKY genes as well as concentrations of jasmonate (JA), salicylate (SA) and the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs). OsERF3 was also found to mediate the resistance of rice to SSB. On the other hand, OsERF3 was slightly suppressed by the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) and increased susceptibility to this piercing sucking insect, possibly by suppressing H(2)O(2) biosynthesis. We propose that OsERF3 affects early components of herbivore-induced defense responses by suppressing MAPK repressors and modulating JA, SA, ethylene and H(2)O(2) pathways as well as plant resistance. Our results also illustrate that OsERF3 acts as a central switch that gears the plant's metabolism towards an appropriate response to chewing or piercing/sucking insects.
21807887	Functional characterization of evolutionarily divergent 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligases in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	4-Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways for monolignol and flavonoid biosynthesis. 4CL has been much studied in dicotyledons, but its function is not completely understood in monocotyledons, which display a different monolignol composition and phenylpropanoid profile. In this study, five members of the 4CL gene family in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were cloned and analyzed. Biochemical characterization of the 4CL recombinant proteins revealed that the rice 4CL isoforms displayed different substrate specificities and catalytic turnover rates. Among them, Os4CL3 exhibited the highest turnover rate. No apparent tissue-specific expression of the five 4CLs was observed, but significant differences in their expression levels were detected. The rank in order of transcript abundance was Os4CL3 > Os4CL5 > Os4CL1 > Os4CL4 > Os4CL2. Suppression of Os4CL3 expression resulted in significant lignin reduction, shorter plant growth, and other morphological changes. The 4CL-suppressed transgenics also displayed decreased panicle fertility, which may be attributed to abnormal anther development as a result of disrupted lignin synthesis. This study demonstrates that the rice 4CLs exhibit different in vitro catalytic properties from those in dicots and that 4CL-mediated metabolism in vivo may play important roles in regulating a broad range of biological events over the course of rice growth and development.
21824632	Down-regulation of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase reduces the proportion of arabinofuranose present in rice cell walls.	2011	Phytochemistry	Arabinoxylans may account for up to 25% of the mass of grass cell walls. The interactions of these polysaccharides with themselves and with cellulose and lignin is believed to affect the walls physical properties and increase the walls resistance to biochemical conversion to fermentable sugars. Arabinoxylans have a backbone composed of 1,4-linked β-D-xylosyl residues, some of which are substituted at O-2 or O-3 with single arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. The Araf residues are likely transferred from UDP-Araf to the xylan backbone by arabinofuranosyltransferases. UDP-Araf is itself formed from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) by UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM). In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to suppress UAM expression in rice plants and thereby reduce the amounts of UDP-Araf available for cell wall synthesis. Several of the transgenic plants had reduced proportions of Araf in their walls together with a decrease in the extent of substitution of the xylan backbone, and a reduction of between 25% and 80% in ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid contents of the cell walls. Those transgenic plants with >25% reduction in the amounts of Araf were dwarfed and infertile.
21736653	OsIAA23-mediated auxin signaling defines postembryonic maintenance of QC in rice.	2011	Plant J	Although the quiescent center (QC) is crucial to root development, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its postembryonic maintenance remain obscure. In this study, a semi-dominant mutant that exhibits pleiotropic defects in root tissues, which includes the root cap, lateral and crown roots, was isolated. The mutant is characterized by a loss of QC identity during postembryonic development, and the displayed defects result from a stabilizing mutation in domain II of OsIAA23 (Os06g39590). Expression of OsIAA23 is specific to the QC of the root tip during the development of primary, lateral and crown roots. Consistent with OsIAA23 expression in the QC, the auxin signaling marked by DR5p::GUS (ß-glucuronidase) was absent in the QC region of Osiaa23. Transgenic rice plants harboring Osiaa23 under the control of the QHB promoter mimic partially the defects of Osiaa23. These results indicate that the maintenance of the QC is dependent on OsIAA23-mediated auxin signaling in the QC. These findings provide insight into Aux/IAA-based auxin signaling during postembryonic maintenance of the QC in plants.
21822061	Golgi-localized UDP-glucose transporter is required for cell wall integrity in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Cell wall-related nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) theoretically supply the cytosolic nucleotide sugars for glycosyltransferases (GTs) to carry out ploysaccharide synthesis and modification in the Golgi apparatus. However, the regulation of cell wall synthesis by NSTs remains undescribed. Recently, we have reported the functional characterization of Oryza sativa nucleotide sugar transport (Osnst1) mutant and its corresponding gene. OsNST1/BC14 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and transports UDP-glucose. This mutant provides us with a unique opportunity for evaluation of its abroad impacts on cell wall structure and components. We previously examined cell wall composition of bc14 and wild type plants. Here, the spatial distribution of these cell wall alterations was analyzed by immunolabeling approach. Analysis of the sugar yield in different cell wall fractions indicated that this mutation improves the extractability of cell wall components. Field emission scanning electron microscopy further showed that the orientation of microfibrils in bc14 is irregular when compared to that in wild type. Therefore, this UDP-glucose transporter, making substrates available for polysaccharide biosynthesis, plays a critical role in maintaining cell wall integrity.
21136294	Overexpression of ethylene response factor TERF2 confers cold tolerance in rice seedlings.	2011	Transgenic Res	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a warm-season plant exposed to various stresses. Low temperature is an important factor limiting extension of rice cultivation areas and productivity. Previously, we have demonstrated that tomato ERF protein TERF2 enhances freezing tolerance of transgenic tobacco and tomato plants. Herein, we report that overexpression of TERF2 enhances transgenic rice tolerance to cold without affecting growth or agronomic traits. Physiological assays revealed that TERF2 could not only increase accumulation of osmotic substances and chlorophyll, but also reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and decrease electrolyte leakage in rice under cold stress. Further analysis of gene expression showed that TERF2 could activate expression of cold-related genes, including OsMyb, OsICE1, OsCDPK7, OsSODB, OsFer1, OsTrx23, and OsLti6, in transgenic rice plants under natural condition or cold stress. Thus, our findings demonstrated that TERF2 modulated expression of stress-related genes and a series of physiological adjustments under cold stress, indicating that TERF2 might have important regulatory roles in response to abiotic stress in rice and possess potential utility in improving crop cold tolerance.
21943343	Comparative transcriptomes profiling of photoperiod-sensitive male sterile rice Nongken 58S during the male sterility transition between short-day and long-day.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PGMS) rice, Nongken 58S, was discovered in 1973. It has been widely used for the production of hybrid rice, and great achievements have been made in improving rice yields. However, the mechanism of the male sterility transition in PGMS rice remains to be determined.

RESULTS: To investigate the transcriptome during the male sterility transition in PGMS rice, the transcriptome of Nongken 58S under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) at the glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium forming stages was compared. Seventy-three and 128 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at the glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium forming stages, respectively. Five and 22 genes were markedly up-regulated (≥ 5-fold), and two and five genes were considerably down-regulated (≥ 5-fold) under SD during the male sterility transition. Gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis revealed that four biological processes and the circadian rhythms and the flowering pathways coordinately regulated the male sterility transition. Further quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that the circadian rhythms of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsGI, Hd1, OsLHY and OsDof in leaves were obviously different between Nongken 58S and Nongken 58 under LD conditions. Moreover, both OsPRR37 and Hd1 in the inflorescence displayed differences between Nongken 58S and Nongken 58 under both LD and SD conditions.

CONCLUSION: The results presented here indicate that the transcriptome in Nongken 58S was significantly suppressed under LD conditions. Among these DEGs, the circadian rhythm and the flowering pathway were involved in the male sterility transition. Furthermore, these pathways were coordinately involved in the male sterility transition in PGMS rice.
21955397	Identification of a cluster of PR4-like genes involved in stress responses in rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	PR4 proteins constitute a pathogenesis-related (PR) protein family with a conserved BARWIN domain. In this study, we analyzed PR4-homologous genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and identified five putative PR4 genes designated as OsPR4a-e. The five PR4 genes are located in tandem on chromosome 11 and constitute a gene cluster with high sequence similarity to each other. The OsPR4 proteins have high sequence similarity to reported PR4 proteins from monocotyledonous species and are predicted to be class II PR4 proteins. Distinct diversification of plant PR4 proteins exists between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Except for OsPR4e, which was not detected with any transcript, the other four OsPR4 genes showed diverse temporal-spatial expression patterns, and their expressions are responsive to Magnaporthe grisea infection. Interestingly, the OsPR4 genes are also responsive to abiotic stresses. Their expression levels were strongly induced by at least one of the stress treatments including drought, salt, cold, wounding, heat shock, and ultraviolet. The transcript levels of OsPR4 genes were also induced by some phytohormones such as abscisic acid and jasmonic acid. Transgenic rice with overexpression of OsPR4a showed enhanced tolerance to drought at both seedling and reproductive stages. We conclude that rice PR4 genes are also involved in abiotic stress responses and tolerance in addition to their responsiveness to pathogen attacks.
21897044	Physiological and biochemical characterization of three nucleoside diphosphate kinase isozymes from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization, tissue-specific gene expression, and enzymatic characteristics of three rice NDPK isozymes (OsNDPK1-OsNDPK3). Sequence comparison of the three OsNDPKs suggested differential subcellular localization. Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol. Expression analysis indicated that all the OsNDPKs are expressed in the leaf, leaf sheath, and immature seeds, except for OsNDPK1, in the leaf sheath. Recombinant OsNDPK2 and OsNDPK3 showed lower optimum pH and higher stability under acidic pH than OsNDPK1. In ATP formation, all the OsNDPKs displayed lower K(m) values for the second substrate, ADP, than for the first substrate, NTP, and showed lowest and highest K(m) values for GTP and CTP respectively.
22102032	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of recombinant betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2), a protein involved in jasmine aroma, from Thai fragrant rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Fragrant rice (Oryza sativa L.) betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of fragrance aroma compounds. The extremely low activity of OsBADH2 in catalyzing the oxidation of acetaldehyde is believed to be crucial for the accumulation of the volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) in many scented plants, including fragrant rice. Recombinant fragrant rice OsBADH2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein, purified using Ni Sepharose affinity chromatography and crystallized using the microbatch method. Initial crystals were obtained within 24 h using 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 with 30%(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0.2 M magnesium chloride as the precipitating agent at 291 K. Crystal quality was improved when the enzyme was cocrystallized with NAD(+). Improved crystals were grown in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.4, 24%(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0.2 M ammonium chloride and diffracted to beyond 2.95 Å resolution after being cooled in a stream of N(2) immediately prior to X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystals belonged to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 66.03, b = 183.94, c = 172.28 Å. An initial molecular-replacement solution has been obtained and refinement is in progress.
21914651	A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice.	2012	Mol Plant	Lateral roots are important to plants for the uptake of nutrients and water. Several members of the Aux/IAA family have been shown to play crucial roles in lateral root development. Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development. The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development. The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia. The auxin reporter DR5-GUS (β-glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild-type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps. The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant. Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice.
21679014	Colonization of rice leaf blades by an African strain of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae depends on a new TAL effector that induces the rice nodulin-3 Os11N3 gene.	2011	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	African strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae contain fewer TAL effectors than Asian strains, and their contribution to pathogenicity is unknown. Systematic mutagenesis of tal genes was used to decipher the contribution of each of the eight TAL effector paralogs to pathogenicity of African X. oryzae pv. oryzae BAI3. A strain mutated in talC was severely affected in the production of disease symptoms. Analysis of growth in planta upon leaf-clip inoculation showed that mutant bacteria multiplied only at the site of inoculation at the apex of the leaf, suggesting a requirement for talC during colonization of vascular tissues. Such tissue-specific effect of a tal mutant is a novel phenotype, which has not yet been characterized in other xanthomonads. Microarray experiments comparing the host response of rice leaves challenged with BAI3(R) vs. BAI3(R)ΔtalC were performed to identify genes targeted by TalC. A total of 120 upregulated and 21 downregulated genes were identified, among them Os11N3, which is a member of the MtN3/saliva family. Based on semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and β-glucuronidase reporter assays, we show that Os11N3 is directly upregulated by TalC and identify a TalC DNA target box within the Os11N3 upstream sequence.
21908855	Biophysical characterization of calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins from rice, Oryza sativa L.	2011	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Calmodulin (CaM) transduces the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations by binding to and altering the activities of target proteins, thereby affecting the physiological responses to the vast array of stimuli. Here, we examined the purified recombinant proteins encoded by three Cam and eight Cam-like (CML) genes from rice. With the exception of one OsCML, all recombinant proteins could be purified by Ca(2+)-dependent hydrophobic chromatography and exhibited an electrophoretic mobility shift when incubated with Ca(2+). The three CaMs all bound CaM kinase II peptide, but none of the eight CMLs did, suggesting a possible differential target binding between the CaM and CML proteins. In addition, their conformational changes upon Ca(2+)-binding were evaluated by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy using 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid. Taken together, OsCMLs were found exhibiting a spectrum of both structural and functional characteristics that ranged from typical to atypical of CaMs. From structural comparison, the OsCMLs have overall main-chain conformation nearly identical to OsCaMs, but with distinct distribution of some charged and hydrophobic amino acids on their target-binding site. These results suggest that genetic polymorphism has promoted the functional diversity of the OsCML family, whose members possess modes of actions probably different from, though maybe overlapping with, those of OsCaMs.
21928114	Identification and characterization of SHORTENED UPPERMOST INTERNODE 1, a gene negatively regulating uppermost internode elongation in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	In rice, the elongated internodes are derived from the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM), and the transition of the SAM from the vegetative to the reproductive stage induces internode elongation. In this study, we characterize two shortened uppermost internode mutants (sui1-1 and sui1-2). During the seedling and tillering stages, sui1 plants are morphologically similar to wild-type plants. However, at the heading stage, the sui1-1 mutant exhibits a shortened uppermost internode and a partly sheathed panicle, and the sui1-2 mutant shows an extremely shortened uppermost internode and a fully sheathed panicle. Gibberellin treatment results in elongation of every internode, but the shortened uppermost internode phenotype remains unaltered. Microscopic analysis indicates that cell length of sui1-1 uppermost internode exhibits decreased. Map-based cloning revealed that SUI1 is located on Chromosome 1, and encodes a putative phosphatidyl serine synthase (PSS) family protein. Searches for matches in protein databases showed that OsSUI1 contains the InterPro domain IPR004277, which is conserved in both animal and plant kingdoms. Introduction of a wild-type SUI1 gene fully rescued the mutant phenotype of sui1-1 and sui1-2, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. Consistent with these results, the SUI1-RNAi transgenic plants displayed decreased elongation of the uppermost internode. Our results suggest that SUI1 plays an important role in regulating uppermost internode length by decreasing longitudinal cell length in rice.
21927949	Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication.	2012	Planta	In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: G1, S, G2 and M. In certain condition, the cells skip M-phase and undergo endoreduplication. Endoreduplication, occurring during a modified cell cycle, duplicates the entire genome without being followed by M-phase. A cycle of endoreduplication is common in most of the differentiated cells of plant vegetative tissues and it occurs extensively in cereal endosperm cells. Endoreduplication occurs when CDK/Cyclin complex low or inactive caused by ubiquitin-mediated degradation by APC and their activators. In this study, rice cell cycle switch 52 A (OsCCS52A), an APC activator, is functionally characterized using the reverse genetic approach. In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels. Localization studies revealed that OsCCS52A is a nuclear protein. OsCCS52A interacts with OsCdc16 in yeast. In addition, overexpression of OsCCS52A inhibits mitotic cell division and induces endoreduplication and cell elongation in fission yeast. The homozygous mutant exhibits dwarfism and smaller seeds. Further analysis demonstrated that endoreduplication cycles in the endosperm of mutant seeds were disturbed, evidenced by reduced nuclear and cell sizes. Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm.
21954461	CFL1, a WW domain protein, regulates cuticle development by modulating the function of HDG1, a class IV homeodomain transcription factor, in rice and Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Cell	Plants have a chemically heterogeneous lipophilic layer, the cuticle, which protects them from biotic and abiotic stresses. The mechanisms that regulate cuticle development are poorly understood. We identified a rice (Oryza sativa) dominant curly leaf mutant, curly flag leaf1 (cfl1), and cloned CFL1, which encodes a WW domain protein. We overexpressed both rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 in Arabidopsis thaliana; these transgenic plants showed severely impaired cuticle development, similar to that in cfl1 rice. Reduced expression of At CFL1 resulted in reinforcement of cuticle structure. At CFL1 was predominantly expressed in specialized epidermal cells and in regions where dehiscence and abscission occur. Biochemical evidence showed that At CFL1 interacts with HDG1, a class IV homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor. Suppression of HDG1 function resulted in similar defective cuticle phenotypes in wild-type Arabidopsis but much alleviated phenotypes in At cfl1-1 mutants. The expression of two cuticle development-associated genes, BDG and FDH, was downregulated in At CFL1 overexpressor and HDG1 suppression plants. HDG1 binds to the cis-element L1 box, which exists in the regulatory regions of BDG and FDH. Our results suggest that rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 negatively regulate cuticle development by affecting the function of HDG1, which regulates the downstream genes BDG and FDH.
21966459	Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in OsERF3 and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice.	2011	PLoS One	The phytohormone ethylene is a key signaling molecule that regulates a variety of developmental processes and stress responses in plants. Transcriptional modulation is a pivotal process controlling ethylene synthesis, which further triggers the expression of stress-related genes and plant adaptation to stresses; however, it is unclear how this process is transcriptionally modulated in rice. In the present research, we report the transcriptional regulation of a novel rice ethylene response factor (ERF) in ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance. Through analysis of transcriptional data, one of the drought-responsive ERF genes, OsDERF1, was identified for its activation in response to drought, ethylene and abscisic acid. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsDERF1 (OE) led to reduced tolerance to drought stress in rice at seedling stage, while knockdown of OsDERF1 (RI) expression conferred enhanced tolerance at seedling and tillering stages. This regulation was supported by negative modulation in osmotic adjustment response. To elucidate the molecular basis of drought tolerance, we identified the target genes of OsDERF1 using the Affymetrix GeneChip, including the activation of cluster stress-related negative regulators such as ERF repressors. Biochemical and molecular approaches showed that OsDERF1 at least directly interacted with the GCC box in the promoters of ERF repressors OsERF3 and OsAP2-39. Further investigations showed that OE seedlings had reduced expression (while RI lines showed enhanced expression) of ethylene synthesis genes, thereby resulting in changes in ethylene production. Moreover, overexpression of OsERF3/OsAP2-39 suppressed ethylene synthesis. In addition, application of ACC recovered the drought-sensitive phenotype in the lines overexpressing OsERF3, showing that ethylene production contributed to drought response in rice. Thus our data reveal that a novel ERF transcriptional cascade modulates drought response through controlling the ethylene synthesis, deepening our understanding of the regulation of ERF proteins in ethylene related drought response.
21965541	Transposon Ac/Ds-induced chromosomal rearrangements at the rice OsRLG5 locus.	2011	Nucleic Acids Res	Previous studies have shown that pairs of closely-linked Ac/Ds transposable elements can induce various chromosomal rearrangements in plant genomes. To study chromosomal rearrangements in rice, we isolated a line (OsRLG5-161) that contains two inversely-oriented Ds insertions in OsRLG5 (Oryza sativa Receptor like kinase Gene 5). Among approximately 300 plants regenerated from OsRLG5-161 heterozygous seeds, 107 contained rearrangements including deletions, duplications and inversions of various sizes. Most rearrangements were induced by previously identified alternative transposition mechanism. Furthermore, we also detected a new class of rearrangements that contain juxtaposed inversions and deletions on the same chromosome. We propose that these novel alleles were generated by a previously unreported type of alternative transposition reactions involving the 5' and 3' termini of two inversely-oriented Ds elements located on the same chromatid. Finally, 11% of rearrangements contained inversions resulting from homologous recombination between the two inverted Ds elements in OsRLG5-161. The high frequency inheritance and great variety of rearrangements obtained suggests that the rice regeneration system results in a burst of transposition activity and a relaxation of the controls which normally limit the transposition competence of individual Ds termini. Together, these results demonstrate a greatly enlarged potential of the Ac/Ds system for plant chromosome engineering.
21834856	The purine-rich DNA-binding protein OsPurα participates in the regulation of the rice sucrose synthase 1 gene expression.	2011	Physiol Plant	The rice sucrose synthase 1 (RSus1) gene is transcriptionally induced by sucrose, and a region within its promoter, at -1117 to -958 upstream of the transcription initiation site, was found to be essential for enhancing the sucrose-induced expression. Further dissection of this region revealed that a group of nuclear proteins interact with a 39-bp fragment named A-3-2 (-1045 to -1007). A protein that specifically and directly interacted with A-3-2 was isolated from the suspension-cultured cells of rice and was subsequently identified as a purine-rich DNA-binding protein. The amino acid sequence of this protein, OsPurα, exhibited 73% identity with the Arabidopsis Purα-1 protein, and its modeled structure resembled the structure of Pur-α in Drosophila. Recombinant OsPurα expressed and purified from Escherichia coli was demonstrated to have DNA-binding activity and to interact with A-3-2 specifically. Moreover, OsPurα was able to enhance sucrose-induced expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, which was transcriptionally fused to two copies of a DNA fragment containing A-3-2 and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S minimal promoter, in vivo. The level of OsPurα bound to A-3-2 was higher in cells cultured in the presence of sucrose; however, the level of OsPurα mRNA in cells was not affected by sucrose. The results of this study demonstrate that OsPurα participates in the regulation of RSus1 expression in response to sucrose; nevertheless, it may require other partner proteins for full function.
21912859	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the last step of monolignol biosynthesis. The rice genome contains 12 CAD-like genes, and whereas the proteins encoded by OsCAD2 and OsCAD7 are known to function in monolignol biosynthesis, the degree to which these enzymes contribute to this process and the involvement of the enzymes encoded by the remaining ten genes is unclear. This paper investigates the role of OsCAD2 and the nine other OsCAD-like proteins in monolignol biosynthesis. Among the OsCAD genes analyzed, OsCAD2, an enzyme belonging to the bona fide CAD phylogenetic group, was the most abundantly expressed gene in the uppermost internode, and was expressed at levels that were more than seven times greater than those of the second most abundantly expressed gene, OsCAD1. Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin. Furthermore, expression always preceded lignin accumulation, showing the tight correlation between OsCAD2 expression and monolignol biosynthesis. Additionally, expression of pCAD::GUS was well synchronized with that of rice caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT::GUS), suggesting that the two enzymes function cooperatively during monolignol biosynthesis. Co-expression network analysis of eight OsCAD genes further revealed that, among the OsCAD genes, expression of OsCAD2 was most tightly associated with the transcription of lignin biosynthesis-related genes. These results suggest that OsCAD2 is largely responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice, which is similar to that indicated for the predominant role of other plant bona fide CAD protein to monolignol biosynthesis.
21941532	Comparative Genomics in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.): Identification and Characterisation of an Orthologue for the Rice Plant Architecture-Controlling Gene OsABCG5.	2011	Int J Plant Genomics	Perennial ryegrass is an important pasture grass in temperate regions. As a forage biomass-generating species, plant architecture-related characters provide key objectives for breeding improvement. In silico comparative genomics analysis predicted colocation between a previously identified QTL for plant type (erect versus prostrate growth) and the ortholocus of the rice OsABCG5 gene (LpABCG5), as well as related QTLs in other Poaceae species. Sequencing of an LpABCG5-containing BAC clone identified presence of a paralogue (LpABCG6) in the vicinity of the LpABCG5 locus, in addition to three other gene-like sequences. Comparative genomics involving five other 5 grass species (rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, maize, and foxtail millet) revealed conserved microsynteny in the ABCG5 ortholocus-flanking region. Gene expression profiling and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the two paralogues are functionally distinct. Fourteen additional ABCG5 gene family members, which may interact with the LpABCG5 gene, were identified through sequencing of transcriptomes from perennial ryegrass leaf, anther, and pistils. A larger-scale phylogenetic analysis of the ABCG gene family suggested conservation between major branches of the Poaceae family. This study identified the LpABCG5 gene as a candidate for the plant type determinant, suggesting that manipulation of gene expression may provide valuable phenotypes for perennial ryegrass breeding.
21892614	Molecular characterization of a rice metal tolerance protein, OsMTP1.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare') cDNA subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) libraries constructed using cadmium (Cd)-treated seedling roots were screened to isolate Cd-responsive genes. A cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Metal Tolerance Protein (OsMTP1), was induced by Cd treatment. Plant MTPs belong to cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family, which are widespread in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. OsMTP1 heterologous expression in yeast mutants showed that OsMTP1 was able to complement the mutant strains' hypersensitivity to Ni, Cd, and Zn, but not other metals including Co and Mn. OsMTP1 expression increased tolerance to Zn, Cd, and Ni in wild-type yeast BY4741 during the exponential growth phase. OsMTP1 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized in onion epidermal cell plasma membranes, consistent with an OsMTP1 function in heavy metal transporting. OsMTP1 dsRNAi mediated by transgenic assay in rice seedlings resulted in heavy metal sensitivity and changed the heavy metal accumulation in different organs of mature rice under low-concentration heavy metal stress. Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals, and maintain ion homeostasis in plant.
20838584	The APETALA-2-like transcription factor OsAP2-39 controls key interactions between abscisic acid and gibberellin in rice.	2010	PLoS Genet	The interaction between phytohormones is an important mechanism which controls growth and developmental processes in plants. Deciphering these interactions is a crucial step in helping to develop crops with enhanced yield and resistance to environmental stresses. Controlling the expression level of OsAP2-39 which includes an APETALA 2 (AP2) domain leads to phenotypic changes in rice. Overexpression of OsAP2-39 leads to a reduction in yield by decreasing the biomass and the number of seeds in the transgenic rice lines. Global transcriptome analysis of the OsAP2-39 overexpression transgenic rice revealed the upregulation of a key abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic gene OsNCED-I which codes for 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and leads to an increase in the endogenous ABA level. In addition to OsNCED-1, the gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of a gene that codes for the Elongation of Upper most Internode (EUI) protein, an enzyme that catalyzes 16α, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs, which has been shown to deactivate gibberellins (GAs) in rice. The exogenous application of GA restores the wild-type phenotype in the transgenic line and ABA application induces the expression of EUI and suppresses the expression of OsAP2-39 in the wild-type line. These observations clarify the antagonistic relationship between ABA and GA and illustrate a mechanism that leads to homeostasis of these hormones. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that the expression of both OsNCED-1 and EUI are directly controlled by OsAP2-39. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of the ABA/GA balance in rice which is regulated by OsAP2-39 that in turn regulates plant growth and seed production.
21961694	A highly efficient rice green tissue protoplast system for transient gene expression and studying light/chloroplast-related processes.	2011	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Plant protoplasts, a proven physiological and versatile cell system, are widely used in high-throughput analysis and functional characterization of genes. Green protoplasts have been successfully used in investigations of plant signal transduction pathways related to hormones, metabolites and environmental challenges. In rice, protoplasts are commonly prepared from suspension cultured cells or etiolated seedlings, but only a few studies have explored the use of protoplasts from rice green tissue.

RESULTS: Here, we report a simplified method for isolating protoplasts from normally cultivated young rice green tissue without the need for unnecessary chemicals and a vacuum device. Transfections of the generated protoplasts with plasmids of a wide range of sizes (4.5-13 kb) and co-transfections with multiple plasmids achieved impressively high efficiencies and allowed evaluations by 1) protein immunoblotting analysis, 2) subcellular localization assays, and 3) protein-protein interaction analysis by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and firefly luciferase complementation (FLC). Importantly, the rice green tissue protoplasts were photosynthetically active and sensitive to the retrograde plastid signaling inducer norflurazon (NF). Transient expression of the GFP-tagged light-related transcription factor OsGLK1 markedly upregulated transcript levels of the endogeneous photosynthetic genes OsLhcb1, OsLhcp, GADPH and RbcS, which were reduced to some extent by NF treatment in the rice green tissue protoplasts.

CONCLUSIONS: We show here a simplified and highly efficient transient gene expression system using photosynthetically active rice green tissue protoplasts and its broad applications in protein immunoblot, localization and protein-protein interaction assays. These rice green tissue protoplasts will be particularly useful in studies of light/chloroplast-related processes.
21976713	OsGLU3, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, is required for root cell elongation and division in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Mol Plant	Plant roots move through the soil by elongation. This is vital to their ability to anchor the plant and acquire water and minerals from the soil. In order to identify new genes involved in root elongation in rice, we screened an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized rice library, and isolated a short root mutant, Osglu3-1. The map-based cloning results showed that the mutant was due to a point mutation in OsGLU3, which encodes a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-β-glucanase. Osglu3-1 displayed less crystalline cellulose content in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, and a slightly smaller root meristem as visualized by restricted expression of OsCYCB1,1:GUS. Exogenous application of glucose can suppress both the lower root cell wall cellulose content and short root phenotypes of Osglu3-1. Consistently, OsGLU3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues with strong expression in root tip, lateral root, and crown root primodia. The fully functional OsGLU3-GFP was detected in plasma membrane, and FM4-64-labeled compartments in the root meristem and elongation zones. We also found that phosphate starvation, an environmental stress, altered cell wall cellulose content to modulate root elongation in a OsGLU3-dependant way.
21972902	Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice.	2011	FEBS J	Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is known to be a key player in apoptosis in animals. The components and pathways regulating H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death in plants, however, remain largely unknown. In the present study, rice transgenic lines overexpressing Bcl-2, a human apoptotic suppressor, were obtained. These transgenic lines showed increased tolerance to high levels of H(2)O(2), resulting in increased seed germination rates, root elongation, root tip cell viability and chlorophyll retention compared to control lines. In the control lines, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in DNA laddering and a clear terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling signal, which are the hallmarks of programmed cell death. However, this effect was not detected in the Bcl-2-overexpressing transgenic lines. Further investigations indicated that Bcl-2 suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death but did not inhibit stress-elicited reactive oxygen species production in rice. RT-PCR revealed that the expression of the two vacuolar processing enzyme genes (i.e. OsVPE2 and OsVPE3) was dramatically induced by H(2)O(2) in the wild-type line but not in the Bcl-2-overexpressing line. Moreover, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in the disruption of the vacuolar membrane in the wild-type line. The expression levels of OsVPE1 and OsVPE4 did not significantly differ between the wild-type line and the transgenic line that was treated or untreated with H(2)O(2). The similar roles of Bcl-2 and OsVPEs during endogenous reactive oxygen species-triggered programmed cell death were also confirmed by NaCl stress in rice. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonsatrate that Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death and enhances H(2)O(2) tolerance. We propose that Bcl-2 overexpression in rice suppresses the transcriptional activation of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not of OsVPE1 or OsVPE4.
22038138	The rice bright green leaf (bgl) locus encodes OsRopGEF10, which activates the development of small cuticular papillae on leaf surfaces.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Development of specialized epidermal cells and structures plays a key role in plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the paddy field, the bright green leaf (bgl) mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) exhibit a luminous green color that is clearly distinguishable from the normal green of wild-type plants. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that small cuticular papillae (or small papillae; SP), nipple-like structures, are absent on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of bgl mutants, leading to more direct reflection and less diffusion of green light. Map-based cloning revealed that the bgl locus encodes OsRopGEF10, one of eleven OsRopGEFs in rice. RopGEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rop) activate Rop/Rac GTPases, acting as molecular switches in eukaryotic signal transduction by replacing the bound GDP (inactive form) with GTP (active form) in response to external or internal cues. In agreement with the timing of SP initiation on the leaf epidermis, OsRopGEF10 is most strongly expressed in newly developing leaves before emergence from the leaf sheath. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsRopGEF10 interacts with OsRac1, one of seven OsRac proteins; consistent with this, both proteins are localized in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that OsRopGEF10 activates OsRac1 to turn on the molecular signaling pathway for SP development. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular genetic mechanism of SP formation during early leaf morphogenesis.
15118338	Differential expression of three plastidial sigma factors, OsSIG1, OsSIG2A, and OsSIG2B, during leaf development in rice.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We isolated and characterized two rice nuclear genes, OsSIG2A and OsSIG2B, encoding the putative sigma-factor of the plastid RNA polymerase. Deduced protein sequences predicted a plastid-localizing signal in the N-terminus and subsequent polypeptides similar to known SIG2 proteins. Gene expression analysis revealed that the OsSIG2A transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1. These results indicate differential expression of SIG genes in leaf morphogenesis, suggesting the existence of tissue- and stage-specific functions of SIG proteins for transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes in plant development.
22020099	Rice GDP dissociation inhibitor 3 inhibits OsMAPK2 activity through physical interaction.	2011	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) plays an essential role in regulating the state of bound nucleotides and subcellular localizations of Rab proteins. In our previous study, we showed that OsGDI3 facilitates the recycling of OsRab11 with a help of OsGAP1. In this study, we show that OsGDI3 complement the yeast sec19-1 mutant, a temperature-sensitive allele of the yeast GDI gene, suggesting that OsGDI3 is a functional ortholog of yeast GDI. To obtain further knowledge on the function of OsGDI3, candidate OsGDI3-interacting proteins were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens. OsMAPK2 is one of OsGDI3 interacting proteins from yeast two-hybrid screens and subject to further analysis. A kinase assay showed that the autophosphorylation activity of OsMAPK2 is inhibited by OsGDI3 in vitro. In addition, ectopic expressions of OsGDI3-in Arabidopsis cause reductions at the level of phosphorylated AtMPK in phosphorylation activity. Taken together, OsGDI3 functions as a negative regulator of OsMAPK2 through modulating its kinase activity.
22027003	Comprehensive analysis of AHL homologous genes encoding AT-hook motif nuclear localized protein in rice.	2011	BMB Rep	The AT-hook motif is a small DNA-binding protein motif that has been found in the high mobility group of non-histone chromosomal proteins. The Arabidopsis genome contains 29 genes encoding the AT-hook motif DNA-binding protein (AHL). Recent studies of Arabidopsis genes (AtAHLs) have revealed that they might play diverse functional roles during plant growth and development. In this report, we mined 20 AHL genes (OsAHLs) from the rice genome database using AtAHL genes as queries and characterized their molecular features. A phylogenetic tree revealed that OsAHL proteins can be classified into 2 evolutionary clades. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that all of the OsAHL genes might be functionally expressed genes with 3 distinct expression patterns. Nuclear localization analysis using transgenic Arabidopsis showed that several OsAHL proteins are exclusively localized in the nucleus, indicating that they may act as architectural transcription factors to regulate expression of their target genes during plant growth and development.
22020753	OsLIS-L1 encoding a lissencephaly type-1-like protein with WD40 repeats is required for plant height and male gametophyte formation in rice.	2012	Planta	Although a large number of genes encoding the WD40 motif have been identified as being involved in various developmental processes in Arabidopsis, little is known about the function of these genes in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel rice gene OsLIS-L1 (Lissencephaly type-1-like 1), which is required for normal fertility and the first internode elongation. OsLIS-L1 encodes a lissencephaly type-1-like protein containing the WD40 motif that is required for brain development in human. SMART algorithm analysis indicated that OsLIS-L1 contains a LIS1 homology (LisH) domain, a C terminus to LisH (CTLH) domain, a five WD40-repeat domain in the middle, and a domain with four WD40 repeats which is homologous to the β subunit of trimeric G-proteins (G(β)). OsLIS-L1 transcript is relatively highly abundant in stem and panicle and has a dynamic expression pattern at different panicle developmental stages. Two independent alleles, designated oslis-l1-1 and oslis-l1-2, exhibited similar abnormal developmental phenotypes, including semi-dwarf, shorter panicle length, and reduced male fertility. Cytological examination confirmed that OsLIS-L1 does not affect the meiosis in pollen mother cells. Compared with wild type, the oslis-l1 mutant had abnormal male gametophyte formation, but anther cell wall and pollen wall development were not affected. Histological analysis revealed that OsLIS-L1 regulates the cell proliferation in the first internode under the panicle. Our results indicate that OsLIS-L1 plays an important role in male gametophyte formation and the first internode elongation in rice.
21113669	Functional analysis of a rice late pollen-abundant UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsUgp2) promoter.	2011	Mol Biol Rep	OsUgp2, a rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene, has previously been shown to preferentially express in maturing pollens and plays an important role in pollen starch accumulation. Here, a 1943 bp promoter fragment (P1943) of OsUgp2 was characterized by 5' deletion and gain-of-function experiments. P1943 and its 5' deletion derivatives (P1495, P1005, P665 and P159) were fused to GUS reporter gene and stably introduced into rice plants. Histochemical analyses of different tissues and pollens at different developmental stages of the transgenic plants showed that P1943 could only direct GUS expression in binucleate pollens. P1495 and P1005 could still drive GUS expression in binucleate pollens but at a lower level. On the other hand, neither P665 nor P159 transformant exhibited any GUS activity in pollens. Gain-of-function analyses showed that the region (-1005 to -665 relative to translation start site) combined with a minimal CaMV 35S promoter could direct GUS expression in pollens. Further analysis of 5' deletion truncated at -952, -847 and -740 delimited a 53 bp region (-1005 to -952) essential for pollen-specific expression. The 53 bp sequence contains two motifs of TTTCT and TTTC, which were known to be pollen-specific cis-elements. In addition, the same P1943-GUS fusion construct was introduced into tobacco to analyze its specificity in dicotyledon. Interestingly, the GUS expression pattern in transgenic tobacco was quite different from that in rice. High level of GUS expression was detected in mature pollens as well as leaves, roots, sepals and stigmas. These findings suggested a complicated transcriptional regulation of OsUgp2.
22003982	Two AP2 family genes, supernumerary bract (SNB) and Osindeterminate spikelet 1 (OsIDS1), synergistically control inflorescence architecture and floral meristem establishment in rice.	2012	Plant J	Meristem identity is crucial in determining the inflorescence architecture of grass species. We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice (Oryza sativa). Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems. In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant. Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules. In addition, the AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP). Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels, and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1. This indicates that additional gene(s) participate in the development of branch and floral meristems. Preferential expression of mature miR172s in the area around the spikelet meristems implies that depletion of the AP2 family genes in those meristems via miR172 is an important step in controlling inflorescence branching and the formation of floral organs.
22039214	Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2.	2011	Plant Cell	Legume GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR)-type transcription factors NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY1 (NSP1) and NSP2 are essential for rhizobium Nod factor-induced nodulation. Both proteins are considered to be Nod factor response factors regulating gene expression after symbiotic signaling. However, legume NSP1 and NSP2 can be functionally replaced by nonlegume orthologs, including rice (Oryza sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants. Here, we show that NSP1 and NSP2 are indispensable for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice. Mutant nsp1 plants do not produce SLs, whereas in M. truncatula, NSP2 is essential for conversion of orobanchol into didehydro-orobanchol, which is the main SL produced by this species. The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis. Rice and M. truncatula represent distinct phylogenetic lineages that split approximately 150 million years ago. Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants. NSP1 and NSP2 are single-copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium-induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions.
21979082	Cloning and characterization of catalases from rice, Oryza sativa L.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Catalase is the major H(2)O(2)-scavenging enzyme in all aerobic organisms. From the cDNA sequences of three rice (Oryza sativa L.) genes that encode for predicted catalases (OsCatA, OsCatB, and OsCatC), complete ORFs were subcloned into pET21a and expressed as (His)(6)-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. The recombinant (His)(6)-polypeptides were enriched to apparent homogeneity and characterized. With H(2)O(2) as substrate, the highest catalase k(cat) value (20±1.71×10(-3) min(-1)) was found in recombinant OsCatB. The optimum temperatures for catalase activity were 30 °C for OsCatA and OsCatC and 25 °C for OsCatB, while the pH optima were 8.0, 7.5, and 7.0 for OsCatA, OsCatB, and OsCatC respectively. All the catalases were inhibited by sodium azide, β-mercaptoethanol, and potassium cyanide, but only weakly by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The various catalases exhibited different catalase activities in the presence of different salts at different concentrations, OsCatC showing higher salt inhibitory effects than the two other OsCats.
21984902	The phytocyanin gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.): genome-wide identification, classification and transcriptional analysis.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Phytocyanins (PCs) are plant-specific blue copper proteins involved in electron transport, and a large number of known PCs are considered to be chimeric arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). To date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the OsPC gene family. Therefore, as the first step and a useful strategy to elucidate the functions of OsPCs, there is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis of this gene family.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a total of 62 OsPC genes were identified through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. Based on phylogeny and motif constitution, the family of OsPCs was classified into three subclasses: uclacyanin-like proteins (OsUCLs), stellacyanin-like proteins (OsSCLs) and early nodulin-like proteins (OsENODLs). Structure and glycosylation prediction indicated that 46 OsPCs were glycosylphosphatigylinositol-anchored proteins and 38 OsPCs were chimeric AGPs. Gene duplication analysis revealed that chromosomal segment and tandem duplications contributed almost equally to the expansion of this gene family, and duplication events were mostly happened in the OsUCL subfamily. The expression profiles of OsPC genes were analyzed at different stages of vegetative and reproductive development and under abiotic stresses. It revealed that a large number of OsPC genes were abundantly expressed in the various stages of development. Moreover, 17 genes were regulated under the treatments of abiotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome-wide identification and expression analysis of OsPC genes should facilitate research in this gene family and give new insights toward elucidating their functions in higher plants.
22010949	Rice DUR3 mediates high-affinity urea transport and plays an effective role in improvement of urea acquisition and utilization when expressed in Arabidopsis.	2012	New Phytol	• Despite the great agricultural and ecological importance of efficient use of urea-containing nitrogen fertilizers by crops, molecular and physiological identities of urea transport in higher plants have been investigated only in Arabidopsis. • We performed short-time urea-influx assays which have identified a low-affinity and high-affinity (K(m) of 7.55 μM) transport system for urea-uptake by rice roots (Oryza sativa). • A high-affinity urea transporter OsDUR3 from rice was functionally characterized here for the first time among crops. OsDUR3 encodes an integral membrane-protein with 721 amino acid residues and 15 predicted transmembrane domains. Heterologous expression demonstrated that OsDUR3 restored yeast dur3-mutant growth on urea and facilitated urea import with a K(m) of c. 10 μM in Xenopus oocytes. • Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed upregulation of OsDUR3 in rice roots under nitrogen-deficiency and urea-resupply after nitrogen-starvation. Importantly, overexpression of OsDUR3 complemented the Arabidopsis atdur3-1 mutant, improving growth on low urea and increasing root urea-uptake markedly. Together with its plasma membrane localization detected by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging and with findings that disruption of OsDUR3 by T-DNA reduces rice growth on urea and urea uptake, we suggest that OsDUR3 is an active urea transporter that plays a significant role in effective urea acquisition and utilisation in rice.
22042862	Genetic dissection of the biotic stress response using a genome-scale gene network for rice.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice is a staple food for one-half the world's population and a model for other monocotyledonous species. Thus, efficient approaches for identifying key genes controlling simple or complex traits in rice have important biological, agricultural, and economic consequences. Here, we report on the construction of RiceNet, an experimentally tested genome-scale gene network for a monocotyledonous species. Many different datasets, derived from five different organisms including plants, animals, yeast, and humans, were evaluated, and 24 of the most useful were integrated into a statistical framework that allowed for the prediction of functional linkages between pairs of genes. Genes could be linked to traits by using guilt-by-association, predicting gene attributes on the basis of network neighbors. We applied RiceNet to an important agronomic trait, the biotic stress response. Using network guilt-by-association followed by focused protein-protein interaction assays, we identified and validated, in planta, two positive regulators, LOC_Os01g70580 (now Regulator of XA21; ROX1) and LOC_Os02g21510 (ROX2), and one negative regulator, LOC_Os06g12530 (ROX3). These proteins control resistance mediated by rice XA21, a pattern recognition receptor. We also showed that RiceNet can accurately predict gene function in another major monocotyledonous crop species, maize. RiceNet thus enables the identification of genes regulating important crop traits, facilitating engineering of pathways critical to crop productivity.
21904112	A non-destructive screenable marker, OsFAST, for identifying transgenic rice seeds.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	The production of transgenic plants has contributed greatly to plant research. Previously, an improved method for screening transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds using the FAST (Fluorescence-Accumulating-Seed Technology) method and FAST marker was reported. Arabidopsis seeds containing the FAST marker may be visually screened using a fluorescence stereomicroscope or blue LED handy-type instrument. Although the FAST method was originally designed for Arabidopsis screens, this study endeavors to adapt this method for the screening of other plants. Here, an optimized technology, designated the OsFAST method, is presented as a useful tool for screening transgenic rice seeds. The OsFAST method is based on the expression of the OsFAST-G marker under the control of a seed-embryo-specific promoter, similar to the Arabidopsis FAST-G marker. The OsFAST method provides a simple and non-destructive method for identifying transgenic rice seeds. It is proposed that the FAST method is adaptable to various plant species and will enable a deeper analysis of the floral-dip method.
22038091	Characterization of an inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase gene that is essential for drought and salt stress responses in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Drought and salt stresses are major limiting factors for crop production. To identify critical genes for stress resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought- and salt-hypersensitive mutant dsm3. The mutant phenotype was caused by a T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a putative inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase previously named OsITPK2 with unknown function. Under drought stress conditions, the mutant had significantly less accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugar and showed significantly reduced root volume, spikelet fertility, biomass, and grain yield; however, malondialdehyde level was increased in the mutant. Interestingly, overexpression of DSM3 (OsITPK2) in rice resulted in drought- and salt-hypersensitive phenotypes and physiological changes similar to those in the mutant. Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) level was decreased in the overexpressors under normal condition and drought stress. A few genes related to osmotic adjustment and reactive oxygen species scavenging were down-regulated in the mutant and overexpression lines. The expression level of DSM3 promoter-driven β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in rice was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid. Protoplast transient expression assay indicated that DSM3 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein. Sequence analysis revealed six putative ITPKs in rice. Transcript level analysis of OsITPK genes revealed that they had different tempo-spatial expression patterns, and the responses of DSM3 to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, and high temperature, were distinct from the other five members in rice. These results together suggest that DSM3/OsITPK2 is an important member of the OsITPK family for stress responses, and an optimal expression level is essential for drought and salt tolerance in rice.
21973088	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	New Phytol	• Auxin has an important role in maintaining optimal root system architecture (RSA) that can cope with growth reductions of crops caused by water or nutrient shortages. However, the mechanism of controlling RSA remains largely unclear. Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA--OsARF12--an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa). • OsARF12 as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5::GFP, and OsARF12 was inhibited by osa-miRNA167d by transient expression in tobacco and rice callus. • The root elongation zones of osarf12 and osarf12/25, which had lower auxin concentrations, were distinctly shorter than for the wild-type, possibly as a result of decreased expression of auxin synthesis genes OsYUCCAs and auxin efflux carriers OsPINs and OsPGPs. The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content. • The data provide evidence for the biological function of OsARF12, which is implicated in regulating root elongation. Our investigation contributes a novel insight for uncovering regulation of RSA and the relationship between auxin response and Fe acquisition.
22016342	Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, controls rice floret fertility.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	GH3 proteins control auxin homeostasis by inactivating excess auxin as conjugates of amino acids and sugars and thereby controlling cellular bioactive auxin. Since auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, regulated expression of these genes offers a mechanism to control various developmental processes. OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and OsMADS6, but its contribution to flower development is not known. We functionally characterize OsMGH3 by overexpression and knock-down analysis and show a partial overlap in these phenotypes with that of mutants in OsMADS1 and OsMADS6. The overexpression of OsMGH3 during the vegetative phase affects the overall plant architecture, whereas its inflorescence-specific overexpression creates short panicles with reduced branching, resembling in part the effects of OsMADS1 overexpression. In contrast, the down-regulation of endogenous OsMGH3 caused phenotypes consistent with auxin overproduction or activated signaling, such as ectopic rooting from aerial nodes. Florets in OsMGH3 knock-down plants were affected in carpel development and pollen viability, both of which reduced fertility. Some of these floret phenotypes are similar to osmads6 mutants. Taken together, we provide evidence for the functional significance of auxin homeostasis and its transcriptional regulation during rice panicle branching and floret organ development.
22010108	An apoplastic h-type thioredoxin is involved in the stress response through regulation of the apoplastic reactive oxygen species in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Thioredoxins (Trxs) are a multigenic family of proteins in plants that play a critical role in redox balance regulation through thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. There are 10 members of the h-type Trxs in rice (Oryza sativa), and none of them has been clearly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that OsTRXh1, a subgroup I h-type Trx in rice, possesses reduction activity in vitro and complements the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of Trx-deficient yeast mutants. OsTRXh1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments. Intriguingly, OsTRXh1 is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level. The knockdown of OsTRXh1 results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of OsTRXh1 leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype in rice. In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth. We also analyzed the levels of hydrogen peroxide produced in transgenic plants, and the results show that more hydrogen peroxide is produced in the extracellular space of OsTRXh1 knockdown plants than in wild-type plants, whereas the OsTRXh1 overexpression plants produce less hydrogen peroxide under salt stress. These results show that OsTRXh1 regulates the redox state of the apoplast and influences plant development and stress responses.
22035218	A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice.	2012	Plant J	Toxic aluminum enters the root cells rapidly, therefore internal detoxification is required. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here we functionally characterized a rice gene, Os03g0755100 (OsALS1), that is regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor. OsALS1 encodes a half-size ABC transporter that is a member of the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) sub-group. Expression of OsALS1 was rapidly and specifically induced by Al in the roots, but not by other metals or low pH. OsALS1 was localized at all cells of the roots. Furthermore, OsALS1 is localized to the tonoplast. These expression patterns and cell specificity of localization are different from those of the homologous gene AtALS1 in Arabidopsis. Knockout of OsALS1 in three independent lines resulted in significant increased sensitivity to Al, but did not affect the sensitivity to other metals and low pH. Comparison of Al accumulation patterns between wild-type and osals1 mutants showed that there was no difference in Al levels in the cell sap of root tips between wild-type and the mutants, but the mutants accumulated more Al in the cytosol and nucleus than the wild-type. Expression of OsALS1 in yeast resulted in increased Al sensitivity due to mis-localization. These results indicate that OsALS1 localized at the tonoplast is responsible for sequestration of Al into the vacuoles, which is required for internal detoxification of Al in rice.
22041789	The rice thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin OsCYP20-2 confers enhanced environmental stress tolerance in tobacco and Arabidopsis.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	The role that the putative thylakoid lumenal cyclophilin (CYP) CYP20-2 locates in the thylakoid, and whether CYP20-2 is an essential gene, have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that CYP20-2 is well conserved in several photosynthetic plants and that the transcript level of the rice OsCYP20-2 gene is highly regulated under abiotic stress. We found that ectopic expression of rice OsCYP20-2 in both tobacco and Arabidopsis confers enhanced tolerance to osmotic stress and extremely high light. Based on these results, we suggest that although the exact biochemical function of OsCYP20-2 in the thylakoid lumen (TL) remains unclear, it may be involved in photosynthetic acclimation to help plants cope with environmental stress; the OsCYP20-2 gene may be a candidate for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance.
21770770	Protein elicitor PemG1 from Magnaporthe grisea induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants.	2011	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Elicitors can stimulate defense responses in plants and have become a popular strategy in plant disease control. Previously, we isolated a novel protein elicitor, PemG1, from Magnaporthe grisea. In the present study, PemG1 protein expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli improved resistance of rice and Arabidopsis to bacterial infection, induced transient expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, and increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in rice. The effects of PemG1 on disease resistance and PR gene expression were mobilized systemically throughout the rice plant and persisted for more than 28 days. PemG1-induced accumulation of OsPR-1a in rice was prevented by the calcium channel blockers LaCl₃, BAPTA, EGTA, W7, and TFP. Arabidopsis mutants that are insensitive to jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene showed increased resistance to bacterial infection after PemG1 treatment but PemG1 did not affect resistance of mutants with an impaired salicylic acid (SA) transduction pathway. In rice, PemG1 induced overexpressions of the SA signal-related genes (OsEDS1, OsPAL1, and OsNH1) but not the JA pathway-related genes (OsLOX2 and OsAOS2). Our findings reveal that PemG1 protein can function as an activator of plant disease resistance, and the PemG1-mediated systemic acquired resistance is modulated by SA- and Ca(2+)-related signaling pathways.
22000657	Biosynthesis and emission of insect herbivory-induced volatile indole in rice.	2012	Phytochemistry	Insect-damaged rice plants emit a complex mixture of volatiles that are highly attractive to parasitic wasps. Indole is one constituent of insect-induced rice volatiles, and is produced in plants by the enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase (IGL). The alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSA) is the IGL that catalyses the conversion of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole in the alpha-reaction of tryptophan synthesis; however, TSA is only active in the complex with the beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase and is not capable of producing free indole. In maize a TSA homolog, ZmIgl, is the structural gene responsible for volatile indole biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analysis based on the ZmIgl-sequence indicated that the rice genome contains five homologous genes. Three homologs Os03g58260, Os03g58300 and Os07g08430, have detectable transcript levels in seedling tissue and were expressed in both insect-damaged and control rice plants. Only Os03g58300, however, was up-regulated by insect feeding. Recombinant proteins of the three rice genes were tested for IGL activity. Os03g58300 had a low K(m) for indole-3-glycerol phosphate and a high k(cat), and hence can efficiently produce indole. Os07g08430 exhibited biochemical properties resembling characterized TSAs. In contrast, Os03g58260 was inactive as a monomer. Analysis of Os03g58300 expression and indole emission provides further support that Os03g58300 is the bona fide rice IGL for biosynthesis of indole, in analogy to maize, this gene is termed OsIgl. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genes are localized in two distinct clades together with the maize genes ZmIgl and ZmBx1 (Os03g58300) and ZmTSA (Os03g58260 and Os07g08430). The genes in the two clades have distinct enzyme activities and gene structures in terms of intron/exon organization. These results suggest that OsIgl evolved after the split of monocot and dicot lineages and before the diversification of the Poaceae.
22123026	Real-time imaging and analysis of differences in cadmium dynamics in rice cultivars (Oryza sativa) using positron-emitting 107Cd tracer.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice is a major source of dietary intake of cadmium (Cd) for populations that consume rice as a staple food. Understanding how Cd is transported into grains through the whole plant body is necessary for reducing rice Cd concentrations to the lowest levels possible, to reduce the associated health risks. In this study, we have visualized and quantitatively analysed the real-time Cd dynamics from roots to grains in typical rice cultivars that differed in grain Cd concentrations. We used positron-emitting 107Cd tracer and an innovative imaging technique, the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS). In particular, a new method for direct and real-time visualization of the Cd uptake by the roots in the culture was first realized in this work.

RESULTS: Imaging and quantitative analyses revealed the different patterns in time-varying curves of Cd amounts in the roots of rice cultivars tested. Three low-Cd accumulating cultivars (japonica type) showed rapid saturation curves, whereas three high-Cd accumulating cultivars (indica type) were characterized by curves with a peak within 30 min after 107Cd supplementation, and a subsequent steep decrease resulting in maintenance of lower Cd concentrations in their roots. This difference in Cd dynamics may be attributable to OsHMA3 transporter protein, which was recently shown to be involved in Cd storage in root vacuoles and not functional in the high-Cd accumulating cultivars. Moreover, the PETIS analyses revealed that the high-Cd accumulating cultivars were characterized by rapid and abundant Cd transfer to the shoots from the roots, a faster transport velocity of Cd to the panicles, and Cd accumulation at high levels in their panicles, passing through the nodal portions of the stems where the highest Cd intensities were observed.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first successful visualization and quantification of the differences in whole-body Cd transport from the roots to the grains of intact plants within rice cultivars that differ in grain Cd concentrations, by using PETIS, a real-time imaging method.
22101802	Cloning and characterization of AKR4C14, a rice aldo-keto reductase, from Thai Jasmine rice.	2012	Protein J	Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) is an enzyme superfamily whose members are involved in the metabolism of aldehydes/ketones. The AKR4 subfamily C (AKR4C) is a group of aldo-keto reductases that are found in plants. Some AKR4C(s) in dicot plants are capable of metabolizing reactive aldehydes whereas, such activities have not been reported for AKR4C(s) from monocot species. In this study, we have screened Indica rice genome for genes with significant homology to dicot AKR4C(s) and identified a cluster of putative AKR4C(s) located on the Indica rice chromosome I. The genes including OsI_04426, OsI_04428 and OsI_04429 were successfully cloned and sequenced by qRT-PCR from leaves of Thai Jasmine rice (KDML105). OsI_04428, later named AKR4C14, was chosen for further studies because it shares highest homology to the dicot AKR4C(s). The bacterially expressed recombinant protein of AKR4C14 was successfully produced as a MBP fusion protein and his-tagged protein. The recombinant AKR4C14 were capable of metabolizing sugars and reactive aldehydes i.e. methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product of the glycolysis pathway, glutaraldehyde, and trans-2-hexenal, a natural reactive 2-alkenal. AKR4C14 was highly expressed in green tissues, i.e. leaf sheets and stems, whereas flowers and roots had a significantly lower level of expression. These findings indicated that monocot AKR4C(s) can metabolize reactive aldehydes like the dicot AKR4C(s) and possibly play a role in detoxification mechanism of reactive aldehydes.
22140509	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Plant cytochromes P450 are involved in a wide range of biosynthetic reactions and play various roles in plant development. However, little is known about the biological functions of the subfamily CYP96 in plants.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report a novel semi-dwarf rice mutant, in which a single copy of transposon dissociator (Ds) was inserted into the gene OsCYP96B4 (Oryza sativa Cytochrome P450 96B4). The mutant exhibits the defects in cell elongation and pollen germination, which can be complemented by the wild type OsCYP96B4 and be rescued by remobilization of the Ds element with the presence of the transposase Activator (Ac). Transgenic plants harboring OsCYP96B4 double-stranded RNA interference construct mimicked the mutant phenotype. The oscyp96b4 mutant phenotype could not be rescued by all the tested phytohormones and it was found that OsCYP96B4 reduced plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner. Heterologous expression of OsCYP96B4 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe resulted in missegregation and wider cells. Further investigation showed that the mutant exhibited the defects in the metabolism of some lipid molecular species when compared with the wild type.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oscyp96b4 mutant is a novel rice semi-dwarf mutant. Our data suggest that OsCYP96B4 might be involved in lipid metabolism and regulate cell elongation.
22080728	Hydroxylamine reduction to ammonium by plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins.	2011	Biochemistry	Plants often face hypoxic stress as a result of flooding and waterlogged soils. During these periods, they must continue ATP production and nitrogen metabolism if they are to survive. The normal pathway of reductive nitrogen assimilation in non-legumes, nitrate, and nitrite reductase can be inhibited during low oxygen conditions that are associated with the buildup of toxic metabolites such as nitrite and nitric oxide, so the plant must also have a means of detoxifying these molecules. Compared to animal hemoglobins, plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins are adept at reducing nitrite to nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. Here we test their abilities to reduce hydroxylamine, a proposed intermediate of nitrite reductase, under anaerobic conditions. We find that class 1 rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin (rice nsHb1) and the hemoglobin from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (SynHb) catalyze the reduction of hydroxylamine to ammonium at rates 100-2500 times faster than animal hemoglobins including myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, and blood cell hemoglobin. These results support the hypothesis that plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins contribute to anaerobic nitrogen metabolism in support of anaerobic respiration and survival during hypoxia.
22084314	A rice transmembrane bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP39, regulates the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen (ER stress) by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways. These pathways are known as the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response. In this study, three rice basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (OsbZIP39, OsbZIP50 and OsbZIP60) containing putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) in their C-terminal regions were identified as candidates of the ER stress sensor transducer. One of these proteins, OsbZIP39, was characterized in this study. OsbZIP39 was shown to associate with microsomes as a membrane-integrated protein using the subcellular fractionation method. When the full length and a truncated form of OsbZIP39 without the TMD (OsbZIP39ΔC) was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transfected into rice protoplasts, the proteins were identified in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. This suggests that OsbZIP39 may be converted into a soluble truncated form by proteolytic cleavage and subsequently translocated to the nucleus. Expression of OsbZIP39ΔC clearly activated the binding protein 1 (BiP1) promoter in a rice protoplast transient assay. Overexpression of OsbZIP39ΔC in stable transgenic rice also led to the up-regulation of several ER stress response genes including BiP1 and OsbZIP50 in the absence of ER stress. However, in the OsbZIP39ΔC-overexpressing line, OsbZIP50 mRNA did not undergo IRE1 (inositol-requiring protein 1)-mediated cytoplasmic splicing that is required for its activation. These data indicate that OsbZIP39 may be directly involved in the regulation of several ER stress response genes.
22058019	A subset of OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, affects normal growth and leaf development of rice.	2011	Mol Cells	Since the identification of BRI1-Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), a member of the Somatic Embryogenesis Receptor Kinase (SERK) family, the dual functions of BAK1 in BR signaling and innate immunity in Arabidopsis have attracted considerable attention as clues for understanding developmental processes that must be balanced between growth and defense over the life of plants. Here, we extended our research to study cellular functions of OsSERKs in rice. As it was difficult to identify an authentic ortholog of AtBAK1 in rice, we generated transgenic rice in which the expression of multiple OsSERK genes, including OsBAK1, was reduced by OsBAK1 RNA interference. Resulting transgenic rice showed reduced levels of Os-BAK1 and decreased sensitivity to BL, leading to semidwarfism in overall growth. Moreover, they resulted in abnormal growth patterns, especially in leaf development. Most of the OsBAK1RNAi transgenic rice plants were defective in the development of bulliform cells in the leaf epidermal layer. They also showed increased expression level of pathogenesis-related gene and enhanced susceptibility to a rice blast-causing fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. These results indicate that OsSERK genes, such as OsBAK1, play versatile roles in rice growth and development.
22123790	Mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase 2 (OsHMA2) restrict the translocation of zinc and cadmium.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Widespread soil contamination with heavy metals has fostered the need for plant breeders to develop new crops that do not accumulate heavy metals. Metal-transporting transmembrane proteins that transport heavy metals across the plant plasma membrane are key targets for developing these new crops. Oryza sativa heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) is known to be a useful gene for limiting cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice. OsHMA2 is a close homolog of OsHMA3, but the function of OsHMA2 is unknown. To gain insight into the function of OsHMA2, we analyzed three Tos17 insertion mutants. The translocation ratios of zinc (Zn) and Cd were clearly lower in all mutants than in the wild type, suggesting that OsHMA2 is a major transporter of Zn and Cd from roots to shoots. By comparing each allele in the OsHMA2 protein structure and measuring the Cd translocation ratio, we identified the C-terminal region as essential for Cd translocation into shoots. Two alleles were identified as good material for breeding rice that does not contain Cd in the grain but does contain some Zn, and that grows normally.
22142475	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus.	2012	Virus Res	RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) from fungi, plants and some invertebrate animals play fundamental roles in antiviral defense. Here, we investigated the role of RDR6 in the defense of economically important rice plants against a negative-strand RNA virus (Rice stripe virus, RSV) that causes enormous crop damage. In three independent transgenic lines (OsRDR6AS line A, B and C) in which OsRDR6 transcription levels were reduced by 70-80% through antisense silencing, the infection and disease symptoms of RSV were shown to be significantly enhanced. The hypersusceptibilities of the OsRDR6AS plants were attributed not to enhanced insect infestation but to enhanced virus infection. The rise in symptoms was associated with the increased accumulation of RSV genomic RNA in the OsRDR6AS plants. The deep sequencing data showed reduced RSV-derived siRNA accumulation in the OsRDR6AS plants compared with the wild type plants. This is the first report of the antiviral role of a RDR in a monocot crop plant in the defense against a negative-strand RNA virus and significantly expands upon the current knowledge of the antiviral roles of RDRs in the defense against different types of viral genomes in numerous groups of plants.
22050533	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice.	2012	Plant J	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
22147560	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Cell Stress Chaperones	ClpB-cytoplasmic (ClpB-cyt)/Hsp100 is an important chaperone protein in rice. Cellular expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript is governed by heat stress, metal stress, and developmental cues. Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds. Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues. It thus emerges that the only classical HSE present in OsClpB-cyt promoter is involved in repressing expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript under unstressed control conditions. Yeast one-hybrid assays suggested that OsHsfA2c specifically interacts with OsClpB-cyt promoter. OsHsfA2c also showed binding with OsClpB-cyt and OsHsfB4b showed binding with OsClpB-cyt; notably, interaction of OsHsfB4b was seen for all three OsClpB/Hsp100 protein isoforms (i.e., ClpB-cytoplasmic, ClpB-mitochondrial, and ClpB-chloroplastic). Furthermore, OsHsfB4b showed interaction with OsHsfA2c. This study suggests that OsHsfA2c may play a role as transcriptional activator and that OsHsfB4b is an important part of this heat shock responsive circuitry.
22057936	Molecular analysis of OsLEA4 and its contributions to improve E. coli viability.	2012	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	OsLEA4, a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.), contains a 312-bp open reading frame encoding a putative polypeptide of 103 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 11.19 kDa and a theoretical pI of 10.04. OsLEA4 polypeptide is rich in Ala (22%), Lys (15%), Glu (9%), His (8%), Thr (8%), and Arg (7%) and lacking in Trp, Cys, Asn, and Phe residues. OsLEA4 protein contains a Pfam:LEA_1 domain architecture at positions 1-73 with three α-helical domains and without β-sheet domain. In silico predictions showed that OsLEA4 protein was strongly hydrophilic with the grand average of hydropathy value of -0.816 and instability index of 27.31. The hydrophilic regions were found in the conserved motif of OsLEA4. OsLEA4 gene was introduced into Escherichia coli, and a fusion protein (∼29.4 kDa) was expressed after isopropylthio-β-D: -galactoside inducting by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. OsLEA4 protein enhanced the tolerance of E. coli recombinant to high salinity, heat, freezing, and UV radiation, which suggested that OsLEA4 protein may play a protective role under stressed conditions. This is the first successful use of E. coli as a prokaryotic system for LEA production from rice.
22127413	Molecular characterization and functional analysis by heterologous expression in E. coli under diverse abiotic stresses for OsLEA5, the atypical hydrophobic LEA protein from Oryza sativa L.	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	In this study, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of OsLEA5 gene, which belongs to the atypical late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) group 5C from Oryza sativa L. The cDNA of OsLEA5 contains a 456 bp ORF encoding a polypeptide of 151 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16.5 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.07. The OsLEA5 polypeptide is rich in Leu (10%), Ser (8.6%), and Asp (8.6%), while Cys, Trp, and Gln residue contents are very low, which are 2, 1.3, and 1.3%, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that group 5C LEA protein subfamily contains a Pfam:LEA_2 domain architecture and is highly hydrophobic, intrinsically ordered with largely β-sheet and specific amino acid composition and distribution. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA5 was expressed in different tissue organs during different development stages of rice. The expression levels of OsLEA5 in the roots and panicles of full ripe stage were dramatically increased. The results of stress tolerance and cell viability assay demonstrated that recombinant E. coli cells producing OsLEA5 fusion protein exhibited improved resistance against diverse abiotic stresses: high salinity, osmotic, freezing, heat, and UV radiation. The OsLEA5 protein confers stabilization of the LDH under different abiotic stresses, such as heating, freeze-thawing, and drying in vitro. The combined results indicated that OsLEA5 protein was a hydrophobic atypical LEA and closely associated with resistance to multiple abiotic stresses. This research offered the valuable information for the development of crops with enhanced resistance to diverse stresses.
22207574	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice.	2011	Plant Cell	Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), which function at the top level of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, are clustered into three groups. However, no Group C Raf-like MAPKKKs have yet been functionally identified. We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (ila1), resulting from a T-DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene. The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants. Phosphorylation assays revealed that ILA1 is a functional kinase with Ser/Thr kinase activity. ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified six closely related ILA1 interacting proteins (IIPs) of unknown function. Using representative IIPs, the interaction of ILA1 and IIPs was confirmed in vivo. IIPs were localized in the nucleus and showed transactivation activity. Furthermore, ILA1 could phosphorylate IIP4, indicating that IIPs may be the downstream substrates of ILA1. Microarray analyses of leaf lamina joints provided additional evidence for alterations in mechanical strength in ila1. ILA1 is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint.
22130861	An ethylene response factor OsWR1 responsive to drought stress transcriptionally activates wax synthesis related genes and increases wax production in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Increasing evidence has revealed the major enzymes-involved in Arabidopsis and maize wax/cutin synthesis; however, there is limited information about the genes-associated with wax/cutin synthesis in rice. Here we report the characterization of an ethylene response factor gene in rice. This rice wax synthesis regulatory gene 1 (OsWR1) is a homolog of Arabidopsis wax/cutin synthesis regulatory gene WIN1/SHN1. Transcript analysis showed that OsWR1 is induced by drought, abscisic acid and salt, and is predominantly expressed in leaves. Functional analyses indicated that overexpressing OsWR1 (Ox-WR1) improved while RNA interference OsWR1 rice (RI-WR1) decreased drought tolerance, consistent with water loss and cuticular permeability, suggesting that OsWR1-triggered drought response might be associated with cuticular characteristics. In addition, OsWR1 activated the expression of the genes-related to oxidative stress response and membrane stability. Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry analysis further showed that OsWR1 modulated the wax synthesis through alteration of long chain fatty acids and alkanes, evidencing the regulation of OsWR1 in wax synthesis. Detection with real-time PCR amplification indicated that Ox-WR1 enhanced while RI-WR1 decreased the expression of wax/cutin synthesis related genes. Furthermore, OsWR1 physically interacted with the DRE and GCC box in the promoters of wax related genes OsLACS2 and OsFAE1'-L, indicating that OsWR1 at least directly modulates the expression of these genes. Thus our results indicate that OsWR1 is a positive regulator of wax synthesis related genes in rice, and this regulation, distinct from its homology regulator of WIN1/SHN1 in cutin synthesis, subsequently contributes to reduced water loss and enhanced drought tolerance.
22150097	Divergent evolution of oxidosqualene cyclases in plants.	2012	New Phytol	Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant metabolites and have important functions. A diverse array of triterpenoid skeletons are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway by enzymatic cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene. The genomes of the lower plants Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and moss (Physcomitrella patens) contain just one oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) gene (for sterol biosynthesis), whereas the genomes of higher plants contain nine to 16 OSC genes. Here we carry out functional analysis of rice OSCs and rigorous phylogenetic analysis of 96 OSCs from higher plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. The functional analysis identified an amino acid sequence for isoarborinol synthase (OsIAS) (encoded by Os11g35710/OsOSC11) in rice. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that expansion of OSC members in higher plants has occurred mainly through tandem duplication followed by positive selection and diversifying evolution, and consolidated the previous suggestion that dicot triterpene synthases have been derived from an ancestral lanosterol synthase instead of directly from their cycloartenol synthases. The phylogenetic trees are consistent with the reaction mechanisms of the protosteryl and dammarenyl cations which parent a wide variety of triterpene skeletal types, allowing us to predict the functions of the uncharacterized OSCs.
22146717	Tobacco salicylic acid glucosyltransferase is active toward tuberonic acid (12-hydroxyjasmonic acid) and is induced by mechanical wounding stress.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Recently we reported that rice salicylic acid (SA) glucosyltransferase (OsSGT) is active toward 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid (tuberonic acid, TA) and that OsSGT gene expression is induced by wounding stress. Here we report that tobacco SA glucosyltransferase (NtSGT), which is thought to be an ortholog of OsSGT, is also active toward TA. Although NtSGT expression is known to be induced by biotrophic stress, it was also induced by wounding stress in the same manner as OsSGT. These results indicate that this glucosyltransferase is important not only in biotrophic stress but also for wounding stress. It was found that this enzyme is dually functional, with activity both toward TA and SA.

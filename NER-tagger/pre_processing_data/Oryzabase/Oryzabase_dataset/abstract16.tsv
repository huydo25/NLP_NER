8049371	Expressed sequence tags from cultured cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under stressed conditions: analysis of transcripts of genes engaged in ATP-generating pathways.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Large-scale sequencing of randomly selected cDNA clones was used to isolate numerous genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Total RNA used for cDNA synthesis was prepared from suspension-cultured cells of rice grown under stressed conditions, such as in saline or nitrogen-starvation conditions. A total of 780 cDNA clones were partially sequenced and about 15% could be identified as putative genes. In the library constructed under saline conditions, we identified several genes associated with signal transduction, such as protein kinase and small GTP-binding protein genes. Many stress-related genes were isolated from both the saline and nitrogen-starvation libraries. These results indicate that stress treatment of suspension-cultured cells makes it possible to efficiently isolate various types of plant genes. To examine the usefulness of such tagged cDNAs for the study of gene expression in a specific metabolic pathway, we analyzed mRNA levels of genes engaged in the ATP-generating pathways in cultured cells of rice under different stresses, such as 20% sucrose, salt stress, cold stress and nitrogen-starvation stress. The results suggest that the coordinated induction of several genes in key steps under stressed conditions may be essential for activation of the entire energy-producing pathway to maintain homeostasis in rice cells. Expressed sequence tags identified by random cDNA sequencing provide the opportunity to generate a transcript map of rice genes.
9230895	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a proteasome subunit from rice and carrot cells.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	Proteasomes function mainly in the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins that have been conjugated with ubiquitin. We isolated a cDNA clone for a rice protein that exhibited high homology to subunit C2 of proteasomes. Southern blot analysis revealed that the corresponding gene was present as a single copy in the rice genome. After fractionation of a crude extract from cultured cells, a 35-kDa protein that cross-reacted with antibodies against the C2 subunit was recovered in the peak fraction of both 20 S and 26 S complexes. The same antibodies cross-reacted with two proteins in seedlings, one of which was the same as that detected in cultured cells. The level of the protein was reduced in roots under conditions of high salinity. The 35-kDa protein was not detected in the nuclei of rice of carrot cells. However, during somatic embryogenesis of carrot cells, the C2 subunit was found in the nucleus at the globular stage, and it gradually disappeared in the period from the heart to the torpedo stage. Cells at the globular stage are proliferating rapidly, thus, it is possible that proteasomes are associated with the proliferation of plant cells.
9091324	Phosphorylation of the C2 subunit of the proteasome in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	FEBS Lett	Proteasomes function mainly in the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins that have been conjugated with ubiquitin. To demonstrate the phosphorylation of proteasomes in plants, we conducted an enzymatic dephosphorylation experiment with a crude extract of rice cultured cells. The results indicated that the C2 subunit of the 20S proteasome is phosphorylated in vivo in cultured cells. An in-gel kinase assay and analysis of phospho-amino acids revealed that the C2 subunit is phosphorylated by a 40-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, the activity of which is inhibited by heparin, a specific inhibitor of casein kinase II. The catalytic subunit of casein kinase II from Arabidopsis was also able to phosphorylate the C2 subunit. These results suggest that the C2 subunit in rice is probably phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Our demonstration of the phosphorylation of proteasomes in plants suggests that phosphorylation might be involved in the general regulation of the functions of proteasomes.
10517318	Molecular characterization of mitotic cyclins in rice plants.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	Cyclins are known to activate cyclin-dependent protein kinases, which are essential for cell cycle progression in eukaryotes. We isolated full-length cDNAs encoding rice mitotic cyclins named CycA1; os; 1 and CycB2;os;1, which are related to A- and B-type cyclins, respectively, from animals. To characterize the function of these mitotic cyclins, as well as that of another B-type cyclin, CycB2;os;2, each cDNA was introduced into yeast cells. When cDNAs encoding CycA1;os;1, CycB2;os; or CycB2;os;2 were overexpressed in the yeast mutant DLI, which is deficient in G1 cyclins, the mutant phenotype was rescued, indicating that these mitotic cyclins are functional in yeast cells. When the cDNA encoding CycB2;os;1 was expressed in the wild-type yeast strain, the cells lost the ability to grow, whereas the expression of either cycA1;os: 1 or cycB2;os;2 did not inhibit growth. In situ hybridization of these mitotic cyclin genes with rice root apices and counterstaining of chromosomes with a DNA-specific dye revealed that cycA1;os;1 is expressed from the G2 phase to the early M phase, while transcripts of cycB2:os;1 and cycB2;os;2 accumulated until the end of mitosis. Our results indicate that these B2-type cyclins may be involved in the control of mitosis, in combination with a G2/M-phase CDK.
10648822	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice dehydroascorbate reductase.	2000	FEBS Lett	Plant dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), which re-reduces oxidized ascorbate to maintain an appropriate level of ascorbate, is very important, but no gene or cDNA for plant DHAR has been cloned yet. Here, we describe a cDNA for a rice glutathione-dependent DHAR (designated DHAR1). A recombinant Dhar1p produced in Escherichia coli was functional. The expression sequence tag database suggests that Dhar1p homologs exist in various plants. Furthermore, the rice Dhar1p has a low similarity to rat DHAR, although the rice enzyme has a considerably higher specific activity than the mammalian one. The mRNA level of DHAR1, the protein level of Dhar1p and the DHAR activity in rice seedlings were elevated by high temperature, suggesting the protection role of DHAR at high temperature.
11139585	A 33-kDa allergen from rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica). cDNA cloning, expression, and identification as a novel glyoxalase I.	2001	J Biol Chem	Cereal proteins are known to cause allergic reactions such as Baker's asthma and severe atopic dermatitis to certain populations. In rice allergy, proteins with molecular masses of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been demonstrated to be potentially allergenic. In this study, to identify and characterize the 33-kDa allergen, designated Glb33, this protein was first purified to homogeneity, and its cDNA clone was isolated. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant Glb33 was shown to be as reactive as the native Glb33 with mouse IgG and patients' IgE antibodies to Glb33. The Glb33 cDNA coded for a protein of 291 amino acids with two 120-amino acid residue repeats, and the amino acid sequence showed similarity to glyoxalase I from various organisms, including human, plant, yeast, and bacterium. As expected, both native Glb33 purified from rice seeds and the recombinant protein had glyoxalase I activity that catalyzes condensation of methylglyoxal and glutathione into S-lactoylglutathione. However, Glb33 had a higher sequence identity to the bacterial glyoxalase I rather than to known plant and yeast enzymes. Both the Glb33 transcript and the protein were detected not only in maturing seeds of rice but also in its stem and leaf. Taken all together, the rice allergen, Glb33, was identified to be a novel type of plant glyoxalase I that is expressed in various plant tissues, including maturing seeds.
8666248	Characterization of a rice sucrose-phosphate synthase-encoding gene.	1996	Gene	A rice genomic clone (sps1) coding for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was isolated and sequenced. Rice sps1 contains 13 exons and 12 introns, an unusually long 366-bp leader region with a highly organized primary structure and a promoter region with no obvious homology with eukaryotic promoter consensus sequences. Southern blot analysis showed that SPS is encoded by a single-copy gene in the rice genome. Comparison of the rice, maize, potato and spinach SPS deduced amino acid (aa) sequences showed that these enzymes have a well conserved region comprising their first 700 aa, and a variable C-terminal region. Analysis of rice sps1 expression showed that mRNA levels change during leaf development. SPS activity and mRNA were undetectable in roots.
8194762	Characterization of a rice gene coding for a lipid transfer protein.	1994	Gene	The cloning and sequence analysis of a gene that encodes a lipid transfer protein (LTP) from rice is reported. A genomic DNA library from Oryza sativa was screened using a cDNA encoding a maize LTP. One genomic clone containing the gene (Ltp) was partially sequenced and analyzed. The open reading frame is interrupted by an 89-bp intron. From the results of Southern hybridizations, Ltp appears to be a member of a small multigenic family. Transcripts of the corresponding gene were detected in several tissues including coleoptile, leaf, endosperm, scutellum and root. The transcription start point was determined by primer extension. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the Ltp product is shown to be homologous to LTPs from other crops.
9305762	Rice lipid transfer protein (LTP) genes belong to a complex multigene family and are differentially regulated.	1997	Gene	Several cDNA clones encoding three different lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) have been isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to analyse the complexity, the evolution and the expression of the LTP gene family. The mature proteins deduced from three clones exhibited a molecular mass of 9 kDa, in agreement with the molecular mass of other LTPs from plants. The clones were shown to be homologous in the coding region, while the 3' non-coding regions diverged strongly between the clones. The occurrence of at least three small multigene families encoding these proteins in rice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. When compared with each other and with LTPs from other plants, the cluster including rice LTPs and other cereal LTPs indicated that these genes duplicated rather recently and independently in the different plant phyla. The expression pattern of each gene family was also investigated. Northern blot experiments demonstrated that they are differentially regulated in the different tissues analysed. Components such as salt, salicylic acid and abscisic acid were shown to modulate Ltp gene expression, depending on tissues and gene classes, suggesting a complex regulation of these genes.
1379734	copia-like retrotransposons are ubiquitous among plants.	1992	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transposable genetic elements are assumed to be a feature of all eukaryotic genomes. Their identification, however, has largely been haphazard, limited principally to organisms subjected to molecular or genetic scrutiny. We assessed the phylogenetic distribution of copia-like retrotransposons, a class of transposable element that proliferates by reverse transcription, using a polymerase chain reaction assay designed to detect copia-like element reverse transcriptase sequences. copia-like retrotransposons were identified in 64 plant species as well as the photosynthetic protist Volvox carteri. The plant species included representatives from 9 of 10 plant divisions, including bryophytes, lycopods, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. DNA sequence analysis of 29 cloned PCR products and of a maize retrotransposon cDNA confirmed the identity of these sequences as copia-like reverse transcriptase sequences, thereby demonstrating that this class of retrotransposons is a ubiquitous component of plant genomes.
12369618	OsARF1, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	We screened for auxin-induced genes with an expression correlated to the auxin-induced growth response from rice coleoptiles by fluorescent differential display. A rice homologue of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcriptional regulators, OsARF1, was identified. An OsARF1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. Steady-state levels of OsARF1 mRNA correlated positively with auxin-dependent differential growth: gravitropic stimulation enhanced the amount of OsARF1 transcript in the lower, faster-growing flank accompanied by a decrease in the upper flank of gravitropically stimulated rice coleoptiles. Exogenous auxin up-regulated the steady-state level of OsARF1 mRNA within 15-30 min. This up-regulation is independent of de novo protein synthesis. Thus, OsARF1 is the first ARF that classifies as an early auxin-responsive gene. The observed auxin-dependent regulation comprises a new level of regulation in auxin-induced gene expression and is discussed as a possible feedback mechanism in plant growth control.
14612572	The classical Ubisch bodies carry a sporophytically produced structural protein (RAFTIN) that is essential for pollen development.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Pollen fecundity is crucial to crop productivity and also to biodiversity in general. Pollen development is supported by the tapetum, a metabolically active sporophytic nurse layer that devotes itself to this process. The tapetum in cereals and a vast majority of other plants is of the nonamoeboid type. Unable to reach out to microspores, it secretes nutrients into the anther locule where the microspores reside and develop. Orbicules (Ubisch bodies), studied in various plants since their discovery approximately 140 years ago, are a hallmark of the secretory tapetum. Their significance to tapetal or pollen development has not been established. We have identified in wheat and rice an anther-specific single-copy gene (per haploid genome equivalent) whose suppression in rice by RNA interference nearly eliminated the seed set. The flowers in the transgenics were normal for female functions, but the pollen collapsed and became less viable. Further characterization of the gene product, named RAFTIN, in wheat has shown that it is present in pro-orbicule bodies and it is accumulated in Ubisch bodies. Furthermore, it is targeted to microspore exine. Although the carboxyl portion of RAFTINs shares short, dispersed amino acid sequences (BURP domain) in common with a variety of proteins of disparate biological contexts, the occurrence RAFTIN per se is limited to cereals; neither the Arabidopsis genome nor the vast collection of ESTs suggests any obvious dicot homologs. Furthermore, our results show that RAFTIN is essential for the late phase of pollen development in cereals.
1534703	Presence of three rice sucrose synthase genes as revealed by cloning and sequencing of cDNA.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	By sequencing cDNA clones, we have concluded that three distinct sucrose genes are expressed in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Tainong 67). When the amino acid sequences deduced from these cDNAs as well as those of known sucrose synthase are compared, the highest divergence is found in the C-termini. The most suitable DNA sequences for use as specific for the mRNA derived from these genes have been suggested.
14513364	Genomic characterization of Rim2/Hipa elements reveals a CACTA-like transposon superfamily with unique features in the rice genome.	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	The availability of huge amounts of rice genome sequence now permits large-scale analysis of the structure and molecular characteristics of the previously identified transposase-encoding Rim2 (also called Hipa) element, which is transcriptionally activated by infection with the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea and by treatment with the corresponding fungal elicitor. Based on genomic cloning and data mining from 230 Mb of rice genome sequence, 347 Rim2 elements, with an average size of 5.8 kb, were identified. This indicates that an estimated total of 600-700 Rim2 elements are present in the whole genome. Rim2 insertions occur non-randomly on the chromosomes, as visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The elements harbor 16-bp terminal inverted repeats with the core sequence CACTG, 16-bp sub-terminal repeats, internal variable regions, 3-bp target sequence duplications in the flanking regions, and genes coding for Rim2 proteins (the putative transposase) and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. High levels of insertion into genic regions are observed for members of this family, and the transposition history of the family can be deduced from the high level of shared sequences and analysis of repeat target sites of the elements. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the putative RIM2 proteins fall into a subgroup distinct from the TNP2-like subgroup of transposases. Southern hybridization with genomic DNA from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants demonstrates that the RIM2-coding sequence is unique to the Oryza genome. Our results demonstrate that the Rim2 elements from rice belong to a distinct superfamily of CACTA-like elements with evolutionary diversity.
10936527	Structure, expression and promoter activity of two polyubiquitin genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2000	Plant Sci	We have isolated two rice polyubiquitin genes designated as RUBQ1 and RUBQ2 by screening a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) genomic library with a 32P-labeled ubiquitin cDNA probe. DNA sequence data revealed that both genes contained an open reading frame encoding a hexameric precursor ubiquitin and an intron immediate upstream of the initiation codon. The deduced amino acid sequences of both genes were identical to each other and to other plant ubiquitin sequences. Several putative regulatory elements such as enhancer core and heat shock consensus sequences were found in the 5'-upstream regions of both genes. Northern blot analyses using the 3'-untranslated region as gene specific probes showed that both genes were actively expressed in all rice plant tissues tested. Differential expression was observed in roots where RUBQ2 appeared to be predominantly expressed. Chimeric genes containing the 5'-upstream region including the intron of RUBQ1 or RUBQ2 and the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region were constructed and transferred into rice suspension cells via particle bombardment. GUS activity from constructs containing RUBQ1 and RUBQ2 promoters in rice suspension cells was ten to 15-fold greater than those using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter, and two to threefold greater than constructs with the maize polyubiquitin Ubi1 promoter. The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the two rice polyubiquitin promoters in rice or other monocot transformation systems.
16406238	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene encoding a temperature-dependent chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A cDNA, designated Osfad8, encoding a chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase responsible for trienoic fatty acid formation, was isolated from the leaves of Oryza sativa L. by RT-PCR. Southern blot hybridization indicated that a small gene family composed of two copies or closely linked genes exists. RNA in situ hybridization showed that the accumulation of Osfad8 mRNA was abundant in leaves but hardly detectable in roots. The Osfad8 transcript level in leaves was much higher at 15 degrees C than at normal temperature (25 degrees C). In situ hybridization also showed particularly prominent expression of Osfad8 in the palisade layer and spongy parenchyma cells of leaves when exposed to 15 degrees C conditions for 5 days and 10 days. Two transgenic lines (8S-52 and 8S-101) harboring the Osfad8 ORF in sense orientation under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter contained increased levels of hexadecatrienoic (16:3) and linolenic (18:3) fatty acids. When exposed to 2 degrees C for 7 days, the damage observed to the control plants was significantly alleviated in the 8S-52 and 8S-101 lines. The amounts of trienoic fatty acids in an Osfad8 antisense line (8A-35) declined 40.2% compared to the control plants. The 8A-35 plants survived after growth at 44 degrees C for 3 days while the control plants died. These data suggest that Osfad8 encodes a temperature-dependent chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.
15915636	OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation.	2005	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The Arabidopsis LSD1 and LOL1 proteins both contain three conserved zinc finger domains and have antagonistic effects on plant programmed cell death (PCD). In this study, a rice (Oryza sativa) functional homolog of LSD1, designated OsLSD1, was identified. The expression of OsLSD1 was light-induced or dark-suppressed. Overexpression of OsLSD1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accelerated callus differentiation in transformed rice tissues and increased chlorophyll b content in transgenic rice plants. Antisense transgenic rice plants exhibited lesion mimic phenotype, increased expression of PR-1 mRNA, and an accelerated hypersensitive response when inoculated with avirulent isolates of blast fungus. Both sense and antisense transgenic rice plants conferred significantly enhanced resistance against a virulent isolate of blast fungus. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of OsLSD1 in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) enhanced the tolerance to fumonisins B1 (FB1), a PCD-eliciting toxin. OsLSD1 green fluorescent protein fusion protein was located in the nucleus of tobacco cells. Our results suggest that OsLSD1 plays a negative role in regulating plant PCD, whereas it plays a positive role in callus differentiation.
1386537	A complete sequence of the rice sucrose synthase-1 (RSs1) gene.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	Using a fragment of the maize sucrose synthase gene Sh-1 as probe, the rice genome was shown to contain at least three genes encoding sucrose synthase. One of these genes was isolated from a genomic library, and its full sequence, including 1.7 kb of 5' flanking sequence and 0.9 kb of 3' flanking sequence, is reported. The new rice gene, designated RSs1, is highly homologous to maize Sh-1 (approx. 94% identity in derived amino acid sequence), and contains an identical intron-exon structure (16 exons and 15 introns). Both RSs1 and maize Sh-1 show similar sequence homologies to a second rice sucrose synthase gene described recently (designated RSs2, Yu et al. (1992) Plant Mol Biol 18: 139-142), although both the rice genes predict an extra 6 amino acids at the C-terminus of the protein when compared to the maize gene. The RSs1 5' flanking sequence contains a number of promoter-like sequences, including putative protein-binding regions similar to maize zein genes.
14693376	Transcript abundance of rml1, encoding a putative GT1-like factor in rice, is up-regulated by Magnaporthe grisea and down-regulated by light.	2004	Gene	We isolated and sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA clones, which encoded a putative GT1-like protein with 385 amino acids, from cultivated rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). This protein shows significant amino acid sequence similarities with trihelix DNA-binding GT-1a/B2F and GT-1 factors that were identified in dicot plants. Northern blotting analysis indicated that the transcript of the rice GT-1 factor in seedling was up-regulated by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, down-regulated by various continuous light conditions and expressed rhythmically in light/dark cycles. This GT1-like factor gene was therefore designated as rml1 (rice gene regulated by M. grisea and light). The putative RML1 protein, encoded by this single copy gene, is thus identified as a new member of the plant-specific GT family of transcription factors in rice.
9154986	Copia-like retrotransposons in rice: sequence heterogeneity, species distribution and chromosomal locations.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Degenerated oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify, clone, and analyze sequence heterogeneity and chromosomal distribution of 23 PCR fragments corresponding to the reverse transcriptase domain of copia-like retrotransposons in rice. Of the 23 fragments 22 could be aligned by their deduced amino acid sequences and were divided into 6 groups according to the phylogenetic and Southern blot analyses. Amino acid sequence differences among the 22 aligned fragments ranged from 1 to 64%. Southern blot analysis of 10 rice accessions including indica, japonica and common wild rice, using these 23 fragments as probes, showed that copia-like retrotransposons were present in moderate to high copy numbers in all the rice genome although the exact copy number cannot be determined. The major difference revealed by southern analysis is a differentiation between the four indica varieties as one group and the four japonica varieties and the two wild rice accessions as another group. Polymorphisms were also detected among the indica and japonica varieties by major bands and repeatable minor bands. Five hybridization bands were mapped to chromosomes 3, 4, 8, and 9, respectively. All the five bands were inherited in a dominant Mendelian fashion and were not allelic with each other, indicating that the same element did not reside on the same location in different rice accessions. No transcript of the copia-like reverse transcriptase was detected on northern blot. The results suggest that the sequence heterogeneity and distributional variability of retrotransposons may be one of contributory factors causing genetic diversity in rice.
12920519	A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	Cold stress adversely affects plant growth and crop production. Some plants express a series of cold-responsive genes during cold acclimation to reduce the damage of cold stress. Among them, transcription factors play important roles in enhancing plant cold tolerance. A bHLH-type gene OsbHLH1 was isolated from rice. The predicted OsbHLH1 protein has a putative nuclear-localization signal and a putative DNA binding-domain bHLH-ZIP. The genomic sequence of the OsbHLH1 gene is unique in rice genome and has four introns. The transcription of the OsbHLH1 gene was specifically induced in roots of rice seedlings by cold but not by NaCl, PEG and ABA treatments. The OsbHLH1 protein was located in the nucleus of plant cells and had the ability to activate the transcription of the reporter gene in yeast. In addition, OsbHLH1 had the ability to dimerize. These results indicate that the OsbHLH1 may function as a transcription factor in a cold signal-transduction pathway.
10417726	The Pib gene for rice blast resistance belongs to the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes.	1999	Plant J	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib, one of the rice blast resistance genes. The Pib gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes. Interestingly, a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2 and 3a motifs of the NBS region was found in the N-terminal half of the Pib protein. In addition, eight cysteine residues are clustered in the middle of the LRRs, a feature which has not been reported for other R genes. Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.
11725950	Expression of the Pib rice-blast-resistance gene family is up-regulated by environmental conditions favouring infection and by chemical signals that trigger secondary plant defences.	2001	Plant Mol Biol	The rice blast resistance gene Pib is a member of the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of plant disease resistance (R) genes and belongs to a small gene family. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a Pib homologue (PibH8), and extensive investigation of the expression of the Pib gene family (Pib, PibH8, HPibH8-1, HPibH8-2) under various environmental and chemical treatments. PibH8 shows 42% identity and 60% similarity to Pib and, like Pib, has a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2, and 3a motifs of the NBS region in the N-terminal half of the protein. Interestingly, genes of the Pib family exhibit a diurnal rhythm of expression. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that their expression was regulated dramatically by environmental signals. such as temperature, light and water availability. Their expression was also induced by chemical treatments, such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene and probenazole. Our findings suggest that expression of the Pib gene family is up-regulated by environmental conditions that would favour pathogen infection. This may reflect the evolution of anticipatory control of R gene expression.
2216792	Nucleotide sequence of rice waxy gene.	1990	Nucleic Acids Res	
1627776	Structure and expression during the germination of rice seeds of the gene for a carboxypeptidase.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	The carboxypeptidase gene from rice and corresponding cDNA clones were isolated. The Sal I 11.2 kb fragment of DNA cloned from a size-fractionated genome library contained eight introns and an open reading frame that encoded 500 amino acids (M(r) 55,445). The structure deduced for the carboxypeptidase from rice was very similar to those of type III serine carboxypeptidases from barley and wheat. The extent of homology of the amino acid sequence to that of these carboxypeptidases from barley and wheat was 92.3% and 87.2%, respectively. The accumulation of mRNA for the rice carboxypeptidase was conspicuous in germinating endosperms that contained aleurone layers, but levels were lower in leaves and roots. The abundance of the mRNA in endosperms was enhanced by gibberellic acid (GA) and accumulation of the mRNA was inhibited by abscisic acid (ABA). The rice gene for carboxypeptidase contained some pyrimidine boxes (C/TCTTTTC/T), in the 5' flanking region, which are a characteristic of a GA-responsive gene.
8161571	Cloning and sequencing of the gene for type I carboxypeptidase in rice.	1994	Biochim Biophys Acta	
7972496	Organ-specific and hormone-dependent expression of genes for serine carboxypeptidases during development and following germination of rice grains.	1994	Plant Physiol	Several cDNA clones encoding either serine carboxypeptidases or related proteins of Oryza sativa L. were identified, and the abundance of the corresponding mRNA in immature and germinated grains was examined. The deduced amino acid sequence of each cDNA included key sequences, such as a pentapeptide (G-X-S-X-G/A) that is conserved among many serine carboxypeptidases, and the putative protein products were classified as two general and one novel type of cereal serine carboxypeptidases. Two general types exhibited considerable homology to type I and type III carboxypeptidases of cereal plants. The novel type encoded a serine carboxypeptidase-like protein that was very similar to type III carboxypeptidases of barley and wheat but had slight differences in both the N- and the C-terminal sequences. The mRNAs of each of these carboxypeptidases were observed in immature grains, and they decreased during maturation. The abundance of mRNA for each class of carboxypeptidase increased again following germination with the same time course and in a tissue-specific manner. The mRNAs for type I and type III-like carboxypeptidases were abundant in germinated embryos composed of leaf, root, and scutellum, whereas the mRNA for type III carboxypeptidase was conspicuous in endosperm that contained the aleurone layer. Altered amounts of mRNA in deembryonated half-grains in response to phytohormones, such as gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, were only detectable in the case of type III carboxypeptidase. Southern blot analysis using rice genomic DNA revealed the simple organization of each gene for these three classes of carboxypeptidases.

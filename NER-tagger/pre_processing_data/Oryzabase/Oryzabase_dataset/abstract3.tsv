10520450	Type 2 rice metallothionein-like gene has two introns.	1998	DNA Seq	A type 2 rice metallothionein-like gene was isolated from root by PCR and sequenced. The PCR fragment was designated as pcr1460, which overlaps with OsMT-2, a cDNA sequence previously characterized, with the presence of two additional segments, 583 and 613 bp in length. These segments are recognized as introns which divide the coding sequence into three exons, 65, 78 and 106 base pairs in length. The sequences flanking the introns conform with the GT/AG rule for splice junctions, and one exonic open reading frame can be identified in each of the introns. The observation that MT-like gene has two introns is the first of such a finding obtained from monocotyledonous plants.
8541504	A gibberellin-stimulated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene is involved in alpha-amylase gene expression in rice aleurone.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) gene, induced by gibberellin (GA) within an hour, was identified in rice (Oryza sativa) seeds by the mRNA differential display technique. GA inducibility was confirmed by RNA hybridization. A full-length UBC cDNA clone and a genomic clone have been isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence shares a significant identity with several known UBC sequences, which are probably involved in the pathway responsible for degrading short-lived regulatory proteins. In vivo transient assays using the UBC gene promoter, joined to the luciferase cDNA as the reporter gene, showed that the sequence located between positions 231 and 159 upstream of the transcription start site of this promoter is crucial for GA-dependent activation of the luciferase cDNA. Finally, trans-activation experiments indicated that this UBC gene is involved in gibberellin-stimulated alpha-amylase gene expression.
9107028	Cloning of a Ca(2+)-ATPase gene and the role of cytosolic Ca2+ in the gibberellin-dependent signaling pathway in aleurone cells.	1997	Plant J	The ultimate goal of this investigation was to identify intermediary steps in the gibberellin (GA)-dependent signaling pathway in rice aleurone cells. By using a differential display approach, a number of putative GA-responsive genes were isolated. One of them, a GA-responsive Ca(2+)-ATPase gene, was identified and partially characterized. A genomic clone and a cDNA clone were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that this protein resembles an endoplasmic reticulum membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. In a transient assay in rice aleurone cells, expression of the introduced Ca(2+)-ATPase cDNA bypassed the GA requirement for stimulating the expression of a major target gene, the alpha-amylase c gene (Osamy-c). This result suggests that GA-dependent expression of this Ca(2+)-ATPase gene (OsCa-atpase) plays an important role in the GA-dependent signal-transduction pathway. To investigate the possible involvement of other proteins and genes that may affect the intracellular Ca2+ level, compounds which can block different putative steps in the signal-transduction pathway were introduced into rice aleurone cells, and then the level of the OsCa-atpase transcript or the Osamy-c transcript was monitored. In the presence of GA, the rice Ca(2+)-ATPase and the Ca2+ channels appeared to co-regulate the local concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. The release of Ca2+ from the internal stores to the cytoplasm was presumably initiated by inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate which reached a peak level within 25 min after GA induction. As a second messenger, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM), and the Ca2+/CaM complex regulates the cytosolic Ca2+ by affecting expression of the OsCa-atpase. Finally, a working model is proposed for the GA-dependent signaling pathway in aleurone cells.
15663008	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice phosphoribulokinase gene that is regulated by environmental stresses.	2004	Mol Biol Rep	Phosphoribulokinase (PRKase, EC 2.7.1.19) plays an important role in regulating the flow of sugar through the Calvin cycle. To investigate its regulatory character and expression pattern, the gene encoding PRKase in rice was cloned by RACE. A full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 1212 bp encoding 403 amino acids residues was obtained from an indica rice variety, 9311. The OsPrk is a single locus gene in the rice genome. It is localized in the region of 28.32 approximately 28.33 Mb on the Chromosome 2, flanked by the genetic markers RM450 and MRG0168. RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsPrk gene was expressed in all the tissues we tested and OsPrk transcript level could be dramatically boosted by light illumination. Its expression was down-regulated by externally applied NaCl, ABA, MeJA and glucose over 24 hr, whereas it was up-regulated by GA after 24 hr treatments. These results also indicated that OsPrk gene expression is modulated by these factors at multiple levels.
12624189	Increasing vitamin C content of plants through enhanced ascorbate recycling.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential to prevent disease associated with connective tissue (e.g., scurvy), improves cardiovascular and immune cell functions, and is used to regenerate alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). In contrast to most animals, humans lack the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid as a result of a mutation in the last enzyme required for ascorbate biosynthesis. Vitamin C, therefore, must be obtained from dietary sources and, because it cannot be stored in the body, it must be obtained regularly. Once used, ascorbic acid can be regenerated from its oxidized form in a reaction catalyzed by dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR). To examine whether overexpression of DHAR in plants would increase the level of ascorbic acid through improved ascorbate recycling, a DHAR cDNA from wheat was isolated and expressed in tobacco and maize, where DHAR expression was increased up to 32- and 100-fold, respectively. The increase in DHAR expression increased foliar and kernel ascorbic acid levels 2- to 4-fold and significantly increased the ascorbate redox state in both tobacco and maize. In addition, the level of glutathione, the reductant used by DHAR, also increased, as did its redox state. These results demonstrate that the vitamin C content of plants can be elevated by increasing expression of the enzyme responsible for recycling ascorbate.
12913152	BWMK1, a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase, locates in the nucleus and mediates pathogenesis-related gene expression by activation of a transcription factor.	2003	Plant Physiol	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are known to transduce plant defense signals, but the downstream components of the MAPK have as yet not been elucidated. Here, we report an MAPK from rice (Oryza sativa), BWMK1, and a transcription factor, OsEREBP1, phosphorylated by the kinase. The MAPK carries a TDY phosphorylation motif instead of the more common TEY motif in its kinase domain and has an unusually extended C-terminal domain that is essential to its kinase activity and translocation to the nucleus. The MAPK phosphorylates OsEREBP1 that binds to the GCC box element (AGCCGCC) of the several basic pathogenesis-related gene promoters, which in turn enhances DNA-binding activity of the factor to the cis element in vitro. Transient co-expression of the BWMK1 and OsEREBP1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts elevates the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the GCC box element. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing BWMK1 expressed many pathogenesis-related genes at higher levels than wild-type plants with an enhanced resistance to pathogens. These findings suggest that MAPKs contribute to plant defense signal transduction by phosphorylating one or more transcription factors.
16115061	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1.	2005	Plant J	Arabidopsis NPR1/NIM1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which confers lasting broad-spectrum resistance. Over-expression of Arabidopsis NPR1 or the NPR1 homolog 1 (NH1) in rice results in enhanced resistance to the pathogen Xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), suggesting the presence of a related defense pathway in rice. We investigated this pathway in rice by identifying proteins that interact with NH1. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding a novel protein, named NRR (for negative regulator of resistance). NRR interacts with NPR1 in the NPR1-interacting domain (NI25) consisting of 25 amino acids. NRR also interacts with NH1; however, NI25 was not sufficient for a strong interaction, indicating a difference between the rice and the Arabidopsis proteins. Silencing of NRR in rice had little effect on resistance to Xoo. When constitutively over-expressed in rice, NRR affected basal resistance, age-related resistance and Xa21-mediated resistance, causing enhanced susceptibility to Xoo. This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth. Over-expression of NRR suppressed the induction of defense-related genes. NRR:GFP (green fluorescent protein) protein was localized to the nucleus, indicating that NRR may act directly to suppress the activation of defense genes. The fact that NRR compromises Xa21-mediated resistance indicates cross-talk or overlap between NH1- and Xa21-mediated pathways.
15986920	Overexpression of a rice NPR1 homolog leads to constitutive activation of defense response and hypersensitivity to light.	2005	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Arabidopsis NPR1/NIM1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which confers lasting broad-spectrum resistance. Previous reports indicate that rice has a disease-resistance pathway similar to the Arabidopsis SAR pathway. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a rice NPR1 homologue (NH1). Transgenic rice plants overexpressing NH1 (NH1ox) acquire high levels of resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The resistance phenotype is heritable and correlates with the presence of the transgene and reduced bacterial growth. Northern analysis shows that NH1ox rice spontaneously activates defense genes, contrasting with NPR1-overexpressing Arabidopsis, where defense genes are not activated until induction. Wild-type NH1, but not a point mutant corresponding to npr1-1, interacts strongly with the rice transcription factor rTGA2.2 in yeast two-hybrid. Greenhouse-grown NH1ox plants develop lesion-mimic spots on leaves at preflowering stage although no other developmental effects are observed. However, when grown in growth chambers (GCs) under low light, NH1ox plants are dwarfed, indicating elevated sensitivity to light. The GC-grown NH1ox plants show much higher salicylic acid (SA) levels than the wild type, whereas greenhouse-grown NH1ox plants contain lower SA. These results indicate that NH1 may be involved in the regulation of SA in response to environmental changes.
15388961	Four rice genes encoding NADP malic enzyme exhibit distinct expression profiles.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	In plants, the NADP malic enzymes (NADP-MEs) are encoded by small gene families. These NADP-ME gene families are relatively well described in C4 plants but not well studied in C3 plants. In this study, we investigated the NADP-ME gene family in a model C3 monocot plant (rice, Oryza sativa) based on its recently released genomic DNA sequence. We found that the rice NADP-ME family is composed of four members, one plastidic NADP-ME and three cytosolic versions. Although the rice NADP-ME genes identified share a high degree of similarity with one another, one cytosolic NADP-ME (OscytME3) contains several unique amino acid substitutions within highly conserved amino acid regions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OscytME3 might be derived from a different evolutionary branch than the other three rice genes. Expression analysis of the four rice NADP-ME genes indicated that each had a different tissue-specific and developmental profile, although all four responded to stress stimuli.
9225861	Interaction of rice and human SRP19 polypeptides with signal recognition particle RNA.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The signal recognition particle (SRP) controls the transport of secretory proteins into and across lipid bilayers. SRP-like ribonucleoprotein complexes exist in all organisms, including plants. We characterized the rice SRP RNA and its primary RNA binding protein, SRP19. The secondary structure of the rice SRP RNA was similar to that found in other eukaryotes; however, as in other plant SRP RNAs, a GUUUCA hexamer sequence replaced the highly conserved GNRA-tetranucleotide loop motif at the apex of helix 8. The small domain of the rice SRP RNA was reduced considerably. Structurally, rice SRP19 lacked two small region that can be present in other SRP19 homologues. Conservative structure prediction and site-directed mutagenesis of rice and human SRP19 polypeptides indicated that binding to the SRP RNAs occurred via a loop that is present in the N-domain of both proteins. Rice SRP19 protein was able to form a stable complex with the rice SRP RNA in vitro. Furthermore, heterologous ribonucleoprotein complexes with components of the human SRP were assembled, thus confirming a high degree of structural and functional conservation between plant and mammalian SRP components.
9304860	Differential induction of a peroxidase gene family during infection of rice by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	1997	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Induction of peroxidase has been correlated with resistant interactions between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. To assist in analysis of the role of rice peroxidases in plant defense against the bacterial pathogen, three peroxidase genes, POX22.3, POX8.1, and POX5.1, were identified from a rice cDNA library that was constructed from leaves of plants undergoing a resistant reaction. These genes were highly similar in nucleic acid and amino acid sequences and belonged to a gene family. The three genes showed differential expression in infiltrated rice leaves during pathogen interactions and mechanical stress. Only two peroxidase genes, POX8.1 and POX22.3, were predominantly expressed during resistant interactions. These two genes also were expressed during susceptible interactions, but induction was delayed compared with resistant interactions. POXgX9, a fourth peroxidase gene that was isolated from a genomic library, is adjacent to POX22.3 in the rice genome and has greater than 90% similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity to POX22.3. Interestingly, POXgX9 was expressed only in the roots of rice plants. While POX22.3 was expressed in both leaves and roots, POX8.1 and POX5.1 were not detected in roots but were induced in leaves by mechanical wounding at different times after treatment. POX22.3, POX8.1, and POX5.1 were estimated to be present in single copies in rice haploid genome. These results indicate that different members of the rice peroxidase gene family are distinctly regulated in response to various environmental cues.
14675427	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding ent-cassa-12,15-diene synthase, a putative diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic enzyme, from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin elicitor.	2004	Plant J	We have isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding a novel diterpene cyclase, OsDTC1, from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin elicitor. OsDTC1 functions as ent-cassa-12,15-diene synthase, which is considered to play a key role in the biosynthesis of (-)-phytocassanes recently isolated as rice diterpenoid phytoalexins. The expression of OsDTC1 mRNA was also confirmed in ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves. In addition, we identified ent-cassa-12,15-diene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of (-)-phytocassanes, as an endogenous compound in the chitin-elicited suspension-cultured rice cells and the UV-irradiated rice leaves. The OsDTC1 cDNA isolated here will be a useful tool to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the biosynthesis of (-)-phytocassanes in rice.
9338967	Expression of expansin genes is correlated with growth in deepwater rice.	1997	Plant Cell	Expansins are a family of proteins that catalyze long-term extension of isolated cell walls. Previously, two expansin proteins have been isolated from internodes of deepwater rice, and three rice expansin genes, Os-EXP1, Os-EXP2, and Os-EXP3, have been identified. We report here on the identification of a fourth rice expansin gene, Os-EXP4, and on the expression pattern of the rice expansin gene family in deepwater rice. Rice expansin genes show organ-specific differential expression in the coleoptile, root, leaf, and internode. In these organs, there is increased expression of Os-EXP1, Os-EXP3, and Os-EXP4 in developmental regions where elongation occurs. This pattern of gene expression is also correlated with acid-induced in vitro cell wall extensibility. Submergence and treatment with gibberellin, both of which promote rapid internodal elongation, induced accumulation of Os-EXP4 mRNA before the rate of growth started to increase. Our results indicate that the expression of expansin genes in deepwater rice is differentially regulated by developmental, hormonal, and environmental signals and is correlated with cell elongation.
12177491	Barley Cbf3 gene identification, expression pattern, and map location.	2002	Plant Physiol	Although cold and drought adaptation in cereals and other plants involve the induction of a large number of genes, inheritance studies in Triticeae (wheat [Triticum aestivum], barley [Hordeum vulgare], and rye [Secale cereale]) have revealed only a few major loci for frost or drought tolerance that are consistent across multiple genetic backgrounds and environments. One might imagine that these loci could encode highly conserved regulatory factors that have global effects on gene expression; therefore, genes encoding central regulators identified in other plants might be orthologs of these Triticeae stress tolerance genes. The CBF/DREB1 regulators, identified originally in Arabidopsis as key components of cold and drought regulation, merit this consideration. We constructed barley cDNA libraries, screened these libraries and a barley bacterial artificial chromosome library using rice (Oryza sativa) and barley Cbf probes, found orthologs of Arabidopsis CBF/DREB1 genes, and examined the expression and genetic map location of the barley Cbf3 gene, HvCbf3. HvCbf3 was induced by a chilling treatment. HvCbf3 is located on barley chromosome 5H between markers WG364b and saflp58 on the barley cv Dicktoo x barley cv Morex genetic linkage map. This position is some 40 to 50 cM proximal to the winter hardiness quantitative trait locus that includes the Vrn-1H gene, but may coincide with the wheat 5A Rcg1 locus, which governs the threshold temperature at which cor genes are induced. From this, it remains possible that HvCbf3 is the basis of a minor quantitative trait locus in some genetic backgrounds, though that possibility remains to be thoroughly explored.
2491689	Nucleotide sequence of rice nitrate reductase genes.	1989	Plant Mol Biol	
8647451	HEP-COP, a novel human gene whose product is highly homologous to the alpha-subunit of the yeast coatomer protein complex.	1996	Gene	A 4333-bp novel human cDNA sequence designated HEP-COP was isolated from the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by the RACE technique. Within HEP-COP was identified an ORF of 3672 bp encoding a deduced 1224-amino-acid (aa) sequence which exhibited striking homology with the 1201-aa sequence of RET1P, the alpha-subunit of the coatomer complex (alpha-COP) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which participates in membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The aa homology was highest in their N-terminal regions which each contained six WD-40 repeat motifs [Van der Voorn and Ploegh, FEBS Lett. 307 (1992) 131-134], and both proteins were predicted to be hydrophilic with similar estimated molecular masses of 138 324 and 135 599 Da, respectively. Northern blot hybridization demonstrated that HEP-COP was expressed in a wide range of human adult and fetal tissues. RT-PCR analysis revealed no differential expression of HEP-COP in 14 human cancer cell lines, as compared with normal control cells. Considering the close similarities between HEP-COP and yeast alpha-COP, and the ubiquitous expression of HEP-COP implying an essential cellular role, it is likely that HEP-COP is the human homologue of alpha-COP.
14605221	Conserved subgroups and developmental regulation in the monocot rop gene family.	2003	Plant Physiol	Rop small GTPases are plant-specific signaling proteins with roles in pollen and vegetative cell growth, abscisic acid signal transduction, stress responses, and pathogen resistance. We have characterized the rop family in the monocots maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa). The maize genome contains at least nine expressed rops, and the fully sequenced rice genome has seven. Based on phylogenetic analyses of all available Rops, the family can be subdivided into four groups that predate the divergence of monocots and dicots; at least three have been maintained in both lineages. However, the Rop family has evolved differently in the two lineages, with each exhibiting apparent expansion in different groups. These analyses, together with genetic mapping and identification of conserved non-coding sequences, predict orthology for specific rice and maize rops. We also identified consensus protein sequence elements specific to each Rop group. A survey of ROP-mRNA expression in maize, based on multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a massively parallel signature sequencing database, showed significant spatial and temporal overlap of the nine transcripts, with high levels of all nine in tissues in which cells are actively dividing and expanding. However, only a subset of rops was highly expressed in mature leaves and pollen. Intriguingly, the grouping of maize rops based on hierarchical clustering of expression profiles was remarkably similar to that obtained by phylogenetic analysis. We hypothesize that the Rop groups represent classes with distinct functions, which are specified by the unique protein sequence elements in each group and by their distinct expression patterns.
7948920	Early flowering and reduced apical dominance result from ectopic expression of a rice MADS box gene.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Recent studies with dicot plants reveal that floral organ development is controlled by a group of regulatory factors containing the MADS domain. In this study, we have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone from rice, OsMADS1, which encodes a MADS-domain-containing protein. The OsMADS1 amino acid sequence shows 56.2% identity to AGL2 and 44.4% identity to AP1. The MADS box region was the most homologous to other MADS-domain-containing proteins. Northern blot analysis indicated that the rice MADS gene was preferentially expressed in floral organs. In situ localization studies showed that the transcript was uniformly present in young flower primordia and later became localized in palea, lemma, and ovary. Ectopic expression of OsMAD1 with the CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco plants dramatically alters development, resulting in short, bushy, early-flowering plants with reduced apical dominance. These results suggest that the OsMADS1 gene is involved in flower induction and that it may be used for genetic manipulation of certain plant species.
11706039	Identification of a rice RNA- and microtubule-binding protein as the multifunctional protein, a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the beta -oxidation of fatty acids.	2002	J Biol Chem	The control of subcellular mRNA localization and translation is often mediated by protein factors that are directly or indirectly associated with the cytoskeleton. We report the identification and characterization of a rice seed protein that possesses both RNA and microtubule binding activities. In vitro UV cross-linking assays indicated that this protein binds to all mRNA sequences tested, although there was evidence for preferential binding to RNAs that contained A-C nucleotide sequence motifs. The protein was purified to homogeneity using a two-step procedure, and amino acid sequencing identified it as the multifunctional protein (MFP), a peroxisomal enzyme known to possess a number of activities involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The recombinant version of this rice MFP binds to RNA in UV cross-linking and gel mobility shift experiments, co-sediments specifically with microtubules, and possesses at least two enzymatic activities involved in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation. Taken together these data suggest that MFP has an important role in mRNA physiology in the cytoplasm, perhaps in regulating the localization or translation of mRNAs through an interaction with microtubules, in addition to its peroxisomal function.
2152105	Characterization of a rice gene showing organ-specific expression in response to salt stress and drought.	1990	Plant Cell	Protein changes induced by salinity stress were investigated in the roots of the salt-sensitive rice cultivar Taichung native 1. We found eight proteins to be induced and obtained partial sequences of one with a molecular mass of 15 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point of 5.5. Using an oligonucleotide probe based on this information, a cDNA clone, salT, was selected and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acid residues. salT mRNA accumulates very rapidly in sheaths and roots from mature plants and seedlings upon treatment with Murashige and Skoog salts (1%), air drying, abscisic acid (20 microM), polyethylene glycol (5%), sodium chloride (1%), and potassium chloride (1%). Generally, no induction was seen in the leaf lamina even when the stress should affect all parts of the plant uniformly. The organ-specific response of salT is correlatable with the pattern of Na+ accumulation during salt stress.
14660695	The evolution of SMC proteins: phylogenetic analysis and structural implications.	2004	Mol Biol Evol	The SMC proteins are found in nearly all living organisms examined, where they play crucial roles in mitotic chromosome dynamics, regulation of gene expression, and DNA repair. We have explored the phylogenetic relationships of SMC proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as their relationship to similar ABC ATPases, using maximum-likelihood analyses. We have also investigated the coevolution of different domains of eukaryotic SMC proteins and attempted to account for the evolutionary patterns we have observed in terms of available structural data. Based on our analyses, we propose that each of the six eukaryotic SMC subfamilies originated through a series of ancient gene duplication events, with the condensins evolving more rapidly than the cohesins. In addition, we show that the SMC5 and SMC6 subfamily members have evolved comparatively rapidly and suggest that these proteins may perform redundant functions in higher eukaryotes. Finally, we propose a possible structure for the SMC5/SMC6 heterodimer based on patterns of coevolution.
11444696	Resistance gene analogs in barley and their relationship to rust resistance genes.	2001	Genome	Regions of amino acid conservation in the NBS domain of NBS-LRR resistance proteins facilitated the PCR isolation of eight resistance gene analog (RGA) sequences from genomic DNA of rice, barley, and Aegilops tauschii. These clones and other RGAs previously isolated from maize, rice, and wheat were assigned to 13 classes by DNA-sequence comparison and by their patterns of hybridisation to restricted barley DNA. Using a doubled-haploid mapping population, probes from 12 RGA classes were used to map 17 loci in the barley genome. Many of these probes have been used for mapping in wheat, and the collective data indicate that the positions of orthologous RGAs are conserved between barley and wheat. RGA loci were identified in the vicinity of barley leaf rust resistance loci Rph4, Rph7, and Rph10. Recombinants were identified between RGA loci and Rph7 and Rph10, while a cluster of RGA sequences detected by probe 5.2 cosegregated with Rph4 in 55 F2 lines.
12684538	A network of rice genes associated with stress response and seed development.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We used a systematic approach to build a network of genes associated with developmental and stress responses in rice by identifying interaction domains for 200 proteins from stressed and developing tissues, by measuring the associated gene expression changes in different tissues exposed to a variety of environmental, biological, and chemical stress treatments, and by localizing the cognate genes to regions of stress-tolerance trait genetic loci. The integrated data set suggests that similar genes respond to environmental cues and stresses, and some may also regulate development. We demonstrate that the data can be used to correctly predict gene function in monocots and dicots. As a result, we have identified five genes that contribute to disease resistance in Arabidopsis.
14750518	Identification of rice (Oryza sativa) proteins linked to the cyclin-mediated regulation of the cell cycle.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	Yeast two-hybrid assays were used to identify rice proteins interacting with two rice cyclins and other proteins potentially involved in cell cycling. The DNA sequences encoding 119 protein fragments identified were then compared by BLAST against proteins in GenBank. The proteins found include myosin-like proteins, transcription factors, kinesins, centromere proteins and undefined proteins. Based on interactions with cyclins and other elements required for cycling, we believe the undefined proteins may be involved in associated cycling processes. The identification of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation in rice may allow for the control of agronomic traits involving plant growth or development.
9177257	Group I allergens of grass pollen as cell wall-loosening agents.	1997	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Group I allergens are the major allergens of grass pollen, but their biological function is unknown. These proteins are shown here to be structurally related to expansins, which are able to induce extension (creep) of plant cell walls. Extracts of maize pollen possess potent expansin-like activity, as measured in wall extension and wall stress-relaxation assays. This activity is selective for grass cell walls and is, at least partly, due to the action of maize group I allergens. We propose that group I allergens facilitate invasion of the pollen tube into the maternal tissues by loosening the cell walls of the grass stigma and style. Additionally, the presence of related mRNAs in vegetative tissues of rice, Arabidopsis, and soybean implies that allergen homologs may function to loosen walls in growing vegetative tissues as well.
10750717	Identification of multi-gene families encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase in plants by heterologous complementation in Escherichia coli.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	Two cDNAs encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) in Adonis aestivalis, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Lactuca sativa, and single examples from Oryza sativa and Tagetes erecta were identified. An analysis of these and other ipi leads us to suggest a separate origin for green algal and plant genes and propose that a single gene encodes plastid and cytosolic IPI in plants.
14704272	RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease.	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The phloem-specific promoter of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) is regulated in part by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to Box II, an essential cis element. Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP protein RF2a is involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTBV promoter. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second bZIP protein, RF2b. RF2b, identified by its interaction with RF2a, binds to Box II in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF2a/RF2b heterodimers. Like RF2a, RF2b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants. Both RF2a and RF2b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues. However, RF2a and RF2b have different DNA-binding affinities to Box II, show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF2b exhibit a disease-like phenotype. We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the Box II cis element with multiple host factors, including RF2a and RF2b. We also propose that quenching/titration of these and perhaps other transcription factors by RTBV is involved in the development of the symptoms of rice tungro disease.
12591613	Identification and characterization of two new members of the GRAS gene family in rice responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor.	2003	Biochim Biophys Acta	We identified two new members of the GRAS gene family from rice, CIGR1 and CIGR2, which are rapidly induced upon N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor perception. The predicated proteins encoded by CIGR1 and CIGR2 possess significant sequence similarity with previously identified members of the GRAS family, such as Arabidopsis SCARECROW, GAI, RGA, tomato Lateral suppressor, and rice SLR1, all of which have VHIID regions, likely to play a role in cellular signaling. Fusions of CIGR1 and CIGR2 with Green Fluorescent Protein were detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells. The expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2 was dependent on the structure of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides, which parallels the structural specificity for chitin binding to the plasma membrane-localized chitin-binding protein, and independent of de novo protein synthesis. Co-cultivation of rice cells with rice blast fungus strongly induced the expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2, whereas inoculation of suspension cells with phytopathogenic bacteria did not. We hypothesize that CIGR1 and CIGR2 act as transcriptional regulators in the early events of the elicitor-induced defense response in rice.
10371193	Characterisation of a plant 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 homologue which contains a pleckstrin homology domain.	1999	FEBS Lett	A plant homologue of mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) has been identified in Arabidopsis and rice which displays 40% overall identity with human 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1. Like the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and rice 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 possess a kinase domain at N-termini and a pleckstrin homology domain at their C-termini. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 can rescue lethality in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by disruption of the genes encoding yeast 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 homologues. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 interacts via its pleckstrin homology domain with phosphatidic acid, PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 and to a lesser extent with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns4P. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 is able to activate human protein kinase B alpha (PKB/AKT) in the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Arabidopsis 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 is only the second plant protein reported to possess a pleckstrin homology domain and the first plant protein shown to bind 3-phosphoinositides.
2005872	phyB is evolutionarily conserved and constitutively expressed in rice seedling shoots.	1991	Mol Gen Genet	Southern blot analysis indicates that the rice genome contains single copies of genes encoding type A (phyA) and type B (phyB) phytochromes. We have isolated overlapping cDNA and genomic clones encoding the entire phyB polypeptide. This monocot sequence is more closely related to phyB from the dicot, Arabidopsis (73% amino acid sequence identity), than it is to the phyA gene in the rice genome (50% identity). These data support the proposal that phyA and phyB subfamilies diverged early in plant evolution and that subsequent divergence accompanied the evolution of monocots and dicots. Moreover, since rice and Arabidopsis phyB polypeptides are more closely related to one another (73% identity) than are monocot and dicot phyA sequences (63-65% identity), it appears that phyB has evolved more slowly than phyA. Sequence conservation between phyA and phyB is greatest in a central core region surrounding the chromophore attachment site, and least toward the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal ends of the polypeptides, although hydropathy analysis suggests that the overall structure of the two phytochromes has been conserved. Gene-specific Northern blot analysis indicates that, whereas phyA is negatively regulated by phytochrome in rice seedling shoots in the manner typical of monocots, phyB is constitutively expressed irrespective of light treatment. In consequence, phyA and phyB transcripts are equally abundant in fully green tissue. Since Arabidopsis phyB mRNA levels are also unaffected by light, the present results suggest that this mode of regulation is evolutionarily conserved among phyB genes, perhaps reflecting differences in the functional roles of the different phytochrome subfamilies.
1396594	GT-2: a transcription factor with twin autonomous DNA-binding domains of closely related but different target sequence specificity.	1992	EMBO J	A triplet of adjacent, highly similar GT motifs in the phyA promoter of rice functions to support maximal expression of this gene. We have obtained a recombinant clone that encodes a full-length nuclear protein, designated GT-2, which binds specifically to these target sequences. This novel protein contains acidic, basic and proline- + glutamine-rich regions, as well as two autonomous DNA-binding domains, one NH2-terminal and the other COOH-terminal, that discriminate with high resolution between the three GT motifs. A duplicated sequence of 75 amino acids, present once in each DNA-binding domain, appears likely to mediate DNA target element recognition. Each copy of this duplicated protein sequence is predicted to form three amphipathic alpha-helices separated from each other by two short loops. The absence of sequence similarity to other known proteins suggests that this predicted structural unit, which we term the trihelix motif, might be representative of a new class of DNA-binding proteins.
15642712	Evolution and expression analysis of starch synthase III and IV in rice.	2005	J Exp Bot	Plants contain at least five subfamilies of starch synthases, granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) and starch synthases I, II, III, and IV (SSI, SSII, SSIII, SSIV). In this work, two members of SSIII and SSIV, respectively, were cloned and designated OsSSIII-1/-2 and OsSSIV-1/-2 in rice. Together with six other previously reported genes, the SS gene family in rice therefore is known to be duplicated and to comprise ten SS genes distributed among the five subfamilies. The starch synthase activity of each SS was confirmed by expression and enzyme activity assay in E. coli. Expression profile analysis with reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting and zymogram, indicates that OsSSIII-2 and OsSSIV-1 are mainly expressed in endosperm, while OsSSIII-1 and OsSSIV-2 are mainly expressed in the leaves. With a similar pattern of genes encoding other enzymes for starch synthesis, (such as GBSS, SSII, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, and branching enzymes), it is suggested that two divergent groups of these genes should be classified in rice. Group I genes are preferentially expressed in the endosperm and function on storage starch synthesis. Group II genes are mainly expressed in leaves and some of them in the early developing endosperm, and function on transient starch synthesis in rice.
9852132	Multiple forms of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF subunits expressed in higher plants.	1998	J Biol Chem	Requirements for intron recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in plants differ from those in vertebrates and yeast. Plant introns contain neither conserved branch points nor distinct 3' splice site-proximal polypyrimidine tracts characteristic of the yeast and vertebrate introns, respectively. However, they are strongly enriched in U residues throughout the intron, property essential for splicing. To understand the roles of different sequence elements in splicing, we are characterizing proteins involved in intron recognition in plants. In this work we show that Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, a dicotyledonous plant, contains two genes encoding different homologs of the large 50-65-kDa subunit of the polypyrimidine tract binding factor U2AF, characterized previously in animals and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both plant U2AF65 isoforms, referred to as NpU2AF65a and NpU2AF65b, support splicing of an adenovirus pre-mRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts depleted of the endogenous U2AF factor. Both proteins interact with RNA fragments containing plant introns and show affinity for poly(U) and, to a lesser extend, poly(C) and poly(G). The branch point or the 3' splice site regions do not contribute significantly to intron recognition by NpU2AF65. The existence of multiple isoforms of U2AF may be quite general in plants because two genes expressing U2AF65 have been identified in Arabidopsis, and different isoforms of the U2AF small subunit are expressed in rice.
12569397	Regulation of biosynthesis and intracellular localization of rice and tobacco homologues of nucleosome assembly protein 1.	2003	Planta	The nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) is considered to be a conserved histone chaperone, facilitating the assembly of nucleosomes in all eukaryotes. However, studies in yeast and animal cells also indicated that NAP1 proteins have diverse functions likely independent of nucleosome-assembly activity. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding NAP1-like proteins from the monocotyledon rice ( Oryza sativa L.) and the dicotyledon tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.). Northern-blot analysis demonstrated that the two rice NAP1-like genes are predominantly expressed in stem tissues such as root and shoot apical meristems as well as in young flowers. During the cell cycle, all four tobacco NAP1-like genes are highly expressed, with one of them showing a slightly increased expression at the G1/S transition. These results are consistent with a role for plant NAP1-like proteins in cell division. In vitro binding assays revealed that different NAP1-like proteins bind, with distinct relative binding strengths, to different classes of histone. Intracellular localization analyses showed that some NAP1-like proteins could be targeted into the nucleus whereas others are exclusively cytoplasm-localized. It is thus likely that different plant NAP1-like proteins have distinct functions in vivo. Plant NAP1-like proteins were observed to concentrate around the metaphase plate and in the phragmoplast, suggesting a role in mitotic events and cytokinesis.
15980199	Interacting proteins and differences in nuclear transport reveal specific functions for the NAP1 family proteins in plants.	2005	Plant Physiol	Nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) is conserved from yeast to human and facilitates the in vitro assembly of nucleosomes as a histone chaperone. Inconsistent with their proposed function in the nucleus, however, many NAP1 proteins had been reported to localize in the cytoplasm. We investigated the subcellular localization of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and rice (Oryza sativa) NAP1 family proteins first by identification of interacting partners and by direct examination of the localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. Through treatment of tobacco cells with leptomycin B and mutagenesis of nuclear export signal, we demonstrated that Nicta;NAP1;1 and Orysa;NAP1;1 shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Together with the demonstration that tobacco NAP1 proteins bind histone H2A and H2B, our results support the current model and provide additional evidence that function of NAP1 as histone chaperones appears to be conserved in plants. In addition, we show that tobacco NAP1 proteins interact with tubulin and the mitotic cyclin Nicta;CYCB1;1, suggesting a role for NAP1 in microtubule dynamics. Interestingly, in spite of their high homology with the above NAP1 proteins, the other three tobacco proteins and Orysa;NAP1;2 did not show nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and were localized only in the cytoplasm. Moreover, Orysa;NAP1;3 that lacks a typical nuclear localization signal sequence was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Finally, we show that only Orysa;NAP1;3 could be phosphorylated by casein kinase 2alpha in vitro. However, this phosphorylation was not responsible for nuclear import of Orysa;NAP1;3 as being demonstrated through mutagenesis studies. Together, our results provide an important step toward elucidating the molecular mechanism of function of the NAP1 family proteins in plants.
12527208	Chalcone isomerase gene from rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare): physical, genetic and mutation mapping.	2003	Gene	The barley and rice chalcone flavonone isomerase (Cfi) genes were isolated and identified by homology to the maize Cfi gene. Structure analysis indicated high similarity except that the barley gene lacked intron 3. The maize Cfi gene has been mapped to three loci, but only a single locus was detected in barley and rice. This explains the lack of observed mutants in maize while a single locus anthocyanin-less 30 (ant30), with four alleles ant30-245, ant30-310, ant30-272 and ant30-287 has been described in barley. Based on biochemical analysis it has been suggested that these mutants are in the Cfi gene resulting in absence of anthocyanin. In order to provide molecular evidence for or against this hypothesis we sequenced the four ant30 alleles and compared them to their respective wild-type alleles. The three sodium azide induced mutants ant30-245, ant30-272 and ant30-287 showed single base changes resulting in two non-sense and one mis-sense mutations affecting the protein function. The 1-nitroso-5,6-dihydrouracil induced mutant ant30-310 had one base substitution and a 25 bp deletion. These observations are in accordance with the conclusion that the ant30 phenotype is caused by mutations in the Cfi gene. The nature of the mutants induced is in line with the proposed mechanism of action for the mutagens used.
14631652	cDNA cloning and expression analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) RNase L inhibitor.	2003	DNA Seq	A subtractive cDNA library was constructed using rice (Oryza sativa L.) callus cDNA as driver and differentiating callus cDNA as tester. A novel cDNA fragment encoding RNase L inhibitor (RLI) was isolated by screening the subtractive library, which had a higher expression level in differentiating callus than in callus. The full-length cDNA of rice-RLI was obtained by the method of rapid amplification of cDNA ends, which contained a 1812-bp open reading frame encoding a 604 amino acid polypeptide. Homologous analysis showed that rice-RLI contained the conserved motifs (two repeated P-loops, two ATP-binding boxes and an iron-sulfur binding motif). The fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis showed that it was a constitutive expressed gene but up-regulated in abiotic stress (low temperature and NaCl treatment) and down-regulated under the treatments of NAA and IAA.
11244114	Comparative sequence analysis of colinear barley and rice bacterial artificial chromosomes.	2001	Plant Physiol	Colinearity of a large region from barley (Hordeum vulgare) chromosome 5H and rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 3 has been demonstrated by mapping of several common restriction fragment-length polymorphism clones on both regions. One of these clones, WG644, was hybridized to rice and barley bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries to select homologous clones. One BAC from each species with the largest overlapping segment was selected by fingerprinting and blot hybridization with three additional restriction fragment-length polymorphism clones. The complete barley BAC 635P2 and a 50-kb segment of the rice BAC 36I5 were completely sequenced. A comparison of the rice and barley DNA sequences revealed the presence of four conserved regions, containing four predicted genes. The four genes are in the same orientation in rice, but the second gene is in inverted orientation in barley. The fourth gene is duplicated in tandem in barley but not in rice. Comparison of the homeologous barley and rice sequences assisted the gene identification process and helped determine individual gene structures. General gene structure (exon number, size, and location) was largely conserved between rice and barley and to a lesser extent with homologous genes in Arabidopsis. Colinearity of these four genes is not conserved in Arabidopsis compared with the two grass species. Extensive similarity was not found between the rice and barley sequences other than within the exons of the structural genes, and short stretches of homology in the promoters and 3' untranslated regions. The larger distances between the first three genes in barley compared with rice are explained by the insertion of different transposable retroelements.
12609047	OsDREB genes in rice, Oryza sativa L., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression.	2003	Plant J	The transcription factors DREBs/CBFs specifically interact with the dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT) cis-acting element (core motif: G/ACCGAC) and control the expression of many stress-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A. Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses. The OsDREB1A and OsDREB2A proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated the transcription of the GUS reporter gene driven by DRE in rice protoplasts. Over-expression of OsDREB1A in transgenic Arabidopsis induced over-expression of target stress-inducible genes of Arabidopsis DREB1A resulting in plants with higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses. This indicated that OsDREB1A has functional similarity to DREB1A. However, in microarray and RNA blot analyses, some stress-inducible target genes of the DREB1A proteins that have only ACCGAC as DRE were not over-expressed in the OsDREB1A transgenic Arabidopsis. The OsDREB1A protein bound to GCCGAC more preferentially than to ACCGAC whereas the DREB1A proteins bound to both GCCGAC and ACCGAC efficiently. The structures of DREB1-type ERF/AP2 domains in monocots are closely related to each other as compared with that in the dicots. OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses.
7632927	Identification of a gibberellin-induced gene in deepwater rice using differential display of mRNA.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Differential display of mRNA was employed to identify gibberellin (GA)-regulated genes in deepwater rice. One of the first differentially displayed products identified was shown to be ten-fold induced after start of GA treatment. The sequence of the clone shows complete amino acid identity with histone H3, and its increased mRNA level correlates with the onset of DNA synthesis. We also identified a gene whose expression pattern did not change over the course of treatment with GA and can be used as standard to correct for loading differences on northern blots.
9891412	Transcript level for a gene encoding a putative type 1a plasma membrane receptor is induced by gibberellin in deepwater rice.	1998	Plant Cell Physiol	In search for differentially expressed genes, a novel gene was identified whose transcript levels increased in response to gibberellin in the internodes of deepwater rice. Its expression was high in regions undergoing cell division and lower in the elongation and differentiation zones. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the gene may encode a type 1a receptor with an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain.

21219509	Transpositional landscape of the rice genome revealed by paired-end mapping of high-throughput re-sequencing data.	2011	Plant J	Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile entities that densely populate most eukaryotic genomes and contribute to both their structural and functional dynamics. However, most TE-related sequences in both plant and animal genomes correspond to inactive, degenerated elements, due to the combined effect of silencing pathways and elimination through deletions. One of the major difficulties in fully characterizing the molecular basis of genetic diversity of a given species lies in establishing its genome-wide transpositional activity. Here, we provide an extensive survey of the transpositional landscape of a plant genome using a deep sequencing strategy. This was achieved through paired-end mapping of a fourfold coverage of the genome of rice mutant line derived from an in vitro callus culture using Illumina technology. Our study shows that at least 13 TE families are active in this genotype, causing 34 new insertions. This next-generation sequencing-based strategy provides new opportunities to quantify the impact of TEs on the genome dynamics of the species.
21220310	Pack-Mutator-like transposable elements (Pack-MULEs) induce directional modification of genes through biased insertion and DNA acquisition.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In monocots, many genes demonstrate a significant negative GC gradient, meaning that the GC content declines along the orientation of transcription. Such a gradient is not observed in the genes of the dicot plant Arabidopsis. In addition, a lack of homology is often observed when comparing the 5' end of the coding region of orthologous genes in rice and Arabidopsis. The reasons for these differences have been enigmatic. The presence of GC-rich sequences at the 5' end of genes may influence the conformation of chromatin, the expression level of genes, as well as the recombination rate. Here we show that Pack-Mutator-like transposable elements (Pack-MULEs) that carry gene fragments specifically acquire GC-rich fragments and preferentially insert into the 5' end of genes. The resulting Pack-MULEs form independent, GC-rich transcripts with a negative GC gradient. Alternatively, the Pack-MULEs evolve into additional exons at the 5' end of existing genes, thus altering the GC content in those regions. We demonstrate that Pack-MULEs modify the 5' end of genes and are at least partially responsible for the negative GC gradient of genes in grasses. Such a unique and global impact on gene composition and gene structure has not been observed for any other transposable elements.
21220762	Cloning and characterization of purple acid phosphatase phytases from wheat, barley, maize, and rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) possess significant phytase activity in the mature grains. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) possess little or virtually no preformed phytase activity in the mature grain and depend fully on de novo synthesis during germination. Here, it is demonstrated that wheat, barley, maize, and rice all possess purple acid phosphatase (PAP) genes that, expressed in Pichia pastoris, give fully functional phytases (PAPhys) with very similar enzyme kinetics. Preformed wheat PAPhy was localized to the protein crystalloid of the aleurone vacuole. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that PAPhys possess four conserved domains unique to the PAPhys. In barley and wheat, the PAPhy genes can be grouped as PAPhy_a or PAPhy_b isogenes (barley, HvPAPhy_a, HvPAPhy_b1, and HvPAPhy_b2; wheat, TaPAPhy_a1, TaPAPhy_a2, TaPAPhy_b1, and TaPAPhy_b2). In rice and maize, only the b type (OsPAPhy_b and ZmPAPhy_b, respectively) were identified. HvPAPhy_a and HvPAPhy_b1/b2 share 86% and TaPAPhya1/a2 and TaPAPhyb1/b2 share up to 90% (TaPAPhy_a2 and TaPAPhy_b2) identical amino acid sequences. despite of this, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isogenes are differentially expressed during grain development and germination. In wheat, it was demonstrated that a and b isogene expression is driven by different promoters (approximately 31% identity). TaPAPhy_a/b promoter reporter gene expression in transgenic grains and peptide mapping of TaPAPhy purified from wheat bran and germinating grains confirmed that the PAPhy_a isogene set present in wheat/barley but not in rice/maize is the origin of high phytase activity in mature grains.
21223397	Expression of ER quality control-related genes in response to changes in BiP1 levels in developing rice endosperm.	2011	Plant J	Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen. To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm-specific manner. Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over-expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co-chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line. Transcriptional induction of most chaperones was observed in calli treated with dithiothreitol or tunicamycin, treatments that trigger ER stress, indicating that induction of the chaperone genes in transgenic rice was caused by an ER stress response. In transient assays using rice protoplasts, the ortholog (Os06g0622700) of the AtbZIP60 transcription factor was shown to be involved in activation of some chaperone genes. Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild-type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype. Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.
21224427	Rice two-pore K+ channels are expressed in different types of vacuoles.	2011	Plant Cell	Potassium (K+) is a major nutrient for plant growth and development. Vacuolar K+ ion channels of the two-pore K+ (TPK) family play an important role in maintaining K+ homeostasis. Several TPK channels were previously shown to be expressed in the lytic vacuole (LV) tonoplast. Plants also contain smaller protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) that contain membrane transporters. However, the mechanisms that define how membrane proteins reach different vacuolar destinations are largely unknown. The Oryza sativa genome encodes two TPK isoforms (TPKa and TPKb) that have very similar sequences and are ubiquitously expressed. The electrophysiological properties of both TPKs were comparable, showing inward rectification and voltage independence. In spite of high levels of similarity in sequence and transport properties, the cellular localization of TPKa and TPKb channels was different, with TPKa localization predominantly at the large LV and TPKb primarily in smaller PSV-type compartments. Trafficking of TPKa was sensitive to brefeldin A, while that of TPKb was not. The use of TPKa:TPKb chimeras showed that C-terminal domains are crucial for the differential targeting of TPKa and TPKb. Site-directed mutagenesis of C-terminal residues that were different between TPKa and TPKb identified three amino acids that are important in determining ultimate vacuolar destination.
21229229	Uncovering of major genetic factors generating naturally occurring variation in heading date among Asian rice cultivars.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	To dissect the genetic factors controlling naturally occurring variation of heading date in Asian rice cultivars, we performed QTL analyses using F(2) populations derived from crosses between a japonica cultivar, Koshihikari, and each of 12 cultivars originating from various regions in Asia. These 12 diverse cultivars varied in heading date under natural field conditions in Tsukuba, Japan. Transgressive segregation was observed in 10 F(2) combinations. QTL analyses using multiple crosses revealed a comprehensive series of loci involved in natural variation in flowering time. One to four QTLs were detected in each cross combination, and some QTLs were shared among combinations. The chromosomal locations of these QTLs corresponded well with those detected in other studies. The allelic effects of the QTLs varied among the cross combinations. Sequence analysis of several previously cloned genes controlling heading date, including Hd1, Hd3a, Hd6, RFT1, and Ghd7, identified several functional polymorphisms, indicating that allelic variation at these loci probably contributes to variation in heading date. Taken together, the QTL and sequencing results indicate that a large portion of the phenotypic variation in heading date in Asian rice cultivars could be generated by combinations of different alleles (possibly both loss- and gain-of-function) of the QTLs detected in this study.
21239643	The submergence tolerance regulator SUB1A mediates crosstalk between submergence and drought tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant Cell	Submergence and drought are major constraints to rice (Oryza sativa) production in rain-fed farmlands, both of which can occur sequentially during a single crop cycle. SUB1A, an ERF transcription factor found in limited rice accessions, dampens ethylene production and gibberellic acid responsiveness during submergence, economizing carbohydrate reserves and significantly prolonging endurance. Here, we evaluated the functional role of SUB1A in acclimation to dehydration. Comparative analysis of genotypes with and without SUB1A revealed that SUB1A enhanced recovery from drought at the vegetative stage through reduction of leaf water loss and lipid peroxidation and increased expression of genes associated with acclimation to dehydration. Overexpression of SUB1A augmented ABA responsiveness, thereby activating stress-inducible gene expression. Paradoxically, vegetative tissue undergoes dehydration upon desubmergence even though the soil contains sufficient water, indicating that leaf desiccation occurs in the natural progression of a flooding event. Desubmergence caused the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with acclimation to dehydration, with higher induction in SUB1A genotypes. SUB1A also restrained accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aerial tissue during drought and desubmergence. Consistently, SUB1A increased the abundance of transcripts encoding ROS scavenging enzymes, resulting in enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. Therefore, in addition to providing robust submergence tolerance, SUB1A improves survival of rapid dehydration following desubmergence and water deficit during drought.
21241786	Molecular evolution of two duplicated CDPK genes CPK7 and CPK12 in grass species: a case study in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2011	Gene	Gene duplication contributes to the expansion of gene families and subsequent functional diversification. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are members of an important calcium sensor family involved in abiotic and biotic stress signaling in plants. We report here the molecular evolution and expression analysis of a pair of duplicated CDPK genes CPK7 and CPK12 that arose in the common ancestor of grass species. With higher nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios (dN/dS, or ω), CPK12 genes appear to diverge more rapidly than CPK7s, suggesting relaxed selection constraints on CPK12s. Sliding window analysis revealed increased dN and ω values at N-terminal regions and the calcium-binding EF hand loops. Likelihood analyses using various models in PAML 4.0 showed purifying selection on both CPK7 and CPK12 lineages. In addition to the divergence in cis-element combinations on their promoters, functional divergence of CPK7 and CPK12 genes was also observed in wheat where TaCPK7 was found to respond to drought (PEG), salt (NaCl), cold, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) while TaCPK12 responded only to the treatment of ABA, a feature that may complement or expand TaCPK7-mediated stress signaling networks of wheat. The contrasting expression patterns of CPK7 and CPK12 genes under stress conditions were also observed in rice, suggesting conservative functional evolution of these genes. Since no positive selection was detected between the two lineages, the divergence of CPK7 and CPK12 genes should be ascribed to subfunctionalization, rather than neofunctionalization. Thus, our work demonstrates another case of evolutionary employment of duplicated genes via subfunctionalization for better adaptation.
21246257	Overproduction of a rice aldo-keto reductase increases oxidative and heat stress tolerance by malondialdehyde and methylglyoxal detoxification.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	The accumulation of toxic compounds generated by the interaction between reactive oxygen species and polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids can significantly damage plant cells. A plethora of enzymes act on these reactive carbonyls, reducing their toxicity. Based on the chromosomal localization and on their homology with other stress-induced aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) we have selected three rice AKR genes. The transcription level of OsAKR1 was greatly induced by abscisic acid and various stress treatments; the other two AKR genes tested were moderately stress-inducible. The OsAKR1 recombinant protein exhibited a high nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent catalytic activity to reduce toxic aldehydes including glycolysis-derived methylglyoxal (MG) and lipid peroxidation-originated malondialdehyde (MDA). The function of this enzyme in MG detoxification was demonstrated in vivo in E. coli and in transgenic plants overproducing the OsAKR1 protein. Heterologous synthesis of the OsAKR1 enzyme in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in increased tolerance against oxidative stress generated by methylviologen (MV) and improved resistance to high temperature. In these plants lower levels of MDA were detected both following MV and heat treatment due to the activity of the OsAKR1 enzyme. The transgenic tobaccos also exhibited higher AKR activity and accumulated less MG in their leaves than the wild type plants; both in the presence and absence of heat stress. These results support the positive role of OsAKR1 in abiotic stress-related reactive aldehyde detoxification pathways and its use for improvement of stress tolerance in plants.
21251103	Rice interspecies hybrids show precocious or delayed developmental transitions in the endosperm without change to the rate of syncytial nuclear division.	2011	Plant J	In angiosperms, interspecific crosses often display hybrid incompatibilities that are manifested as under-proliferation or over-proliferation of endosperm. Recent analyses using crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and its related species with different ploidy levels have shown that interspecific hybridization causes delayed developmental transition and increased mitotic activity in the endosperm. In this study, we investigated endosperm development in interspecific crosses between diploid Oryza species. In a cross between female O. sativa and male O. punctata, we found that the hybrid endosperm was reduced in size and this cross was associated with precocious developmental transition. By contrast, the cross between O. sativa and O. longistaminata generated enlarged hybrid endosperm at the mid-point of seed development and this cross was associated with delayed developmental transition. Subsequently, the hybrid endosperm displayed a shriveled appearance at the seed maturation stage. We found that the accumulation of storage products and the expression patterns of several marker genes were also altered in the hybrid endosperm. By contrast, the rate of syncytial mitotic nuclear divisions was not significantly affected. The gene OsMADS87 showed a maternal origin-specific expression pattern in rice endosperm, in contrast to its Arabidopsis homologue PHERES1, which shows paternal origin-specific expression. OsMADS87 expression was decreased or increased depending on the type of developmental transition change in the hybrid rice endosperm. Our results indicate that one of the interspecies hybridization barriers in Oryza endosperm is mediated by precocious or delayed developmental alterations and de-regulation of OsMADS87, without change to the rate of syncytial mitotic nuclear division in the hybrid endosperm.
21251104	Small RNAs from MITE-derived stem-loop precursors regulate abscisic acid signaling and abiotic stress responses in rice.	2011	Plant J	Small silencing RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA regulators that negatively regulate gene expression by guiding mRNA degradation, translation repression or chromatin modification. Plant sRNAs play crucial roles in various developmental processes, hormone signaling, immune responses and adaptation to a variety of abiotic stresses. miR441 and miR446 were previously annotated as microRNAs (miRNAs) because their precursors can form typical stem-loop structures, but are not considered as real miRNAs because of inconsistency with some ancillary criteria of the recent guidelines for annotation of plant miRNAs. We tentatively rename them small interfering (si)R441 and siR446, respectively, in this study. It has recently been shown that the precursors of siR441 and siR446 might originate from the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) Stowaway1. In this report, we show that, in contrast with Dicer-like (DCL)3- and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR)2-dependent MITE-derived ra-siRNAs, siR441 and siR446 are processed by OsDCL3a but independent of OsRDR2, indicating that siR441 and siR446 are generated from single-stranded stem-loop precursors. We also show that abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses downregulate the expression of siR441 and siR446 but, surprisingly, increase the accumulation of their precursors in rice plants, implying that processing of siRNA precursors is inhibited. We provide evidence to show that this defective processing is due to increased precursor accumulation per se, possibly by intermolecular self-pairing of the processing intermediate sequences, thus hindering their normal processing. Functional examinations indicate that siR441 and siR446 are positive regulators of rice ABA signaling and tolerance to abiotic stress, possibly by regulating MAIF1 expression.
21251105	Multiple cytosolic and transmembrane determinants are required for the trafficking of SCAMP1 via an ER-Golgi-TGN-PM pathway.	2011	Plant J	How polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins reach their destination in plant cells remains elusive. Using transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells, we previously showed that the rice secretory carrier membrane protein 1 (SCAMP1), an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains (TMDs), is localized to the PM and trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we study the transport pathway and sorting signals of SCAMP1 by following its transient expression in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts and show that SCAMP1 reaches the PM via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-TGN-PM pathway. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis of various green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions with SCAMP1 mutations further demonstrates that: (i) the cytosolic N-terminus of SCAMP1 contains an ER export signal; (ii) the transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2) and TMD3 of SCAMP1 are essential for Golgi export; (iii) SCAMP1 TMD1 is essential for TGN-to-PM targeting; (iv) the predicted topology of SCAMP1 and its various mutants remain identical as demonstrated by protease protection assay. Therefore, both the cytosolic N-terminus and TMD sequences of SCAMP1 play integral roles in mediating its transport to the PM via an ER-Golgi-TGN pathway.
21251107	Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase repairs ultraviolet-B-induced CPDs in rice chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA.	2011	Plant J	Plants use sunlight as energy for photosynthesis; however, plant DNA is exposed to the harmful effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (280-320 nm) in the process. UV-B radiation damages nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA by the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), which are the primary UV-B-induced DNA lesions, and are a principal cause of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants. Repair of CPDs is therefore essential for plant survival while exposed to UV-B-containing sunlight. Nuclear repair of the UV-B-induced CPDs involves the photoreversal of CPDs, photoreactivation, which is mediated by CPD photolyase that monomerizes the CPDs in DNA by using the energy of near-UV and visible light (300-500 nm). To date, the CPD repair processes in plant chloroplasts and mitochondria remain poorly understood. Here, we report the photoreactivation of CPDs in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA in rice. Biochemical and subcellular localization analyses using rice strains with different levels of CPD photolyase activity and transgenic rice strains showed that full-length CPD photolyase is encoded by a single gene, not a splice variant, and is expressed and targeted not only to nuclei but also to chloroplasts and mitochondria. The results indicate that rice may have evolved a CPD photolyase that functions in chloroplasts, mitochondria and nuclei, and that contains DNA to protect cells from the harmful effects of UV-B radiation.
21251109	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes.	2011	Plant J	The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR-Pia avirulence gene. To clone Pia, we employed a multifaceted genomics approach. First, we selected 12 R-gene analog (RGA) genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins from a region on chromosome 11 that shows linkage to Pia. By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes. We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar 'Sasanishiki' harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype. DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4. The wild-type 'Sasanishiki' allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function. However, when the rice cultivar 'Himenomochi' lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered. An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function. A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection.
21255162	Metabolomics data reveal a crucial role of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;1 in coordinating metabolic balance in rice.	2011	Plant J	Rice plants grown in paddy fields preferentially use ammonium as a source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyses the conversion of ammonium to glutamine. Of the three genes encoding cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 is critical for normal growth and grain filling. However, the basis of its physiological function that may alter the rate of nitrogen assimilation and carbon metabolism within the context of metabolic networks remains unclear. To address this issue, we carried out quantitative comparative analyses between the metabolite profiles of a rice mutant lacking OsGS1;1 and its background wild type (WT). The mutant plants exhibited severe retardation of shoot growth in the presence of ammonium compared with the WT. Overaccumulation of free ammonium in the leaf sheath and roots of the mutant indicated the importance of OsGS1;1 for ammonium assimilation in both organs. The metabolite profiles of the mutant line revealed: (i) an imbalance in levels of sugars, amino acids and metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and (ii) overaccumulation of secondary metabolites, particularly in the roots under a continuous supply of ammonium. Metabolite-to-metabolite correlation analysis revealed the presence of mutant-specific networks between tryptamine and other primary metabolites in the roots. These results demonstrated a crucial function of OsGS1;1 in coordinating the global metabolic network in rice plants grown using ammonium as the nitrogen source.
21263038	Genetic control of a transition from black to straw-white seed hull in rice domestication.	2011	Plant Physiol	The genetic mechanism involved in a transition from the black-colored seed hull of the ancestral wild rice (Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara) to the straw-white seed hull of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) during grain ripening remains unknown. We report that the black hull of O. rufipogon was controlled by the Black hull4 (Bh4) gene, which was fine-mapped to an 8.8-kb region on rice chromosome 4 using a cross between O. rufipogon W1943 (black hull) and O. sativa indica cv Guangluai 4 (straw-white hull). Bh4 encodes an amino acid transporter. A 22-bp deletion within exon 3 of the bh4 variant disrupted the Bh4 function, leading to the straw-white hull in cultivated rice. Transgenic study indicated that Bh4 could restore the black pigment on hulls in cv Guangluai 4 and Kasalath. Bh4 sequence alignment of all taxa with the outgroup Oryza barthii showed that the wild rice maintained comparable levels of nucleotide diversity that were about 70 times higher than those in the cultivated rice. The results from the maximum likelihood Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade test suggested that the significant reduction in nucleotide diversity in rice cultivars could be caused by artificial selection. We propose that the straw-white hull was selected as an important visual phenotype of nonshattered grains during rice domestication.
21264494	OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Plant morphogenesis is highly dependent on the regulation of cell division and expansion. The organization of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall is a key determinant of cell expansion. Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library. It is reported here that OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that exhibits typical structural features of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor protein. The T-DNA insertion in OsBC1L4 results in abnormal cell expansion. A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components. OsBC1L4 was expressed in all tissues/organs examined, with a low level in leaves. OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs). Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis.
21266659	Seventy million years of concerted evolution of a homoeologous chromosome pair, in parallel, in major Poaceae lineages.	2011	Plant Cell	Whole genome duplication ~70 million years ago provided raw material for Poaceae (grass) diversification. Comparison of rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), and Brachypodium distachyon genomes revealed that one paleo-duplicated chromosome pair has experienced very different evolution than all the others. For tens of millions of years, the two chromosomes have experienced illegitimate recombination that has been temporally restricted in a stepwise manner, producing structural stratification in the chromosomes. These strata formed independently in different grass lineages, with their similarities (low sequence divergence between paleo-duplicated genes) preserved in parallel for millions of years since the divergence of these lineages. The pericentromeric region of this homeologous chromosome pair accounts for two-thirds of the gene content differences between the modern chromosomes. Both intriguing and perplexing is a distal chromosomal region with the greatest DNA similarity between surviving duplicated genes but also with the highest concentration of lineage-specific gene pairs found anywhere in these genomes and with a significantly elevated gene evolutionary rate. Intragenomic similarity near this chromosomal terminus may be important in hom(e)ologous chromosome pairing. Chromosome structural stratification, together with enrichment of autoimmune response-related (nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat) genes and accelerated DNA rearrangement and gene loss, confer a striking resemblance of this grass chromosome pair to the sex chromosomes of other taxa.
21274511	Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of a novel recessive gene xa34(t) for resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	A new bacterial blight recessive resistance gene xa34(t) was identified from the descendant of somatic hybridization between an aus rice cultivar (cv.) BG1222 and susceptible cv. IR24 against Chinese race V (isolate 5226). The isolate was used to test the resistance or susceptibility of F(1) progenies and reciprocal crosses of the parents. The results showed that F(1) progenies appeared susceptibility there were 128R (resistant):378S (susceptible) and 119R:375S plants in F(2) populations derived from two crosses of BG1222/IR24 and IR24/BG1222, respectively, which both calculates into a 1R:3S ratio. 320 pairs of stochastically selected SSR primers were used for genes' initial mapping. The screened results showed that two SSR markers, RM493 and RM446, found on rice chromosome 1 linked to xa34(t). Linkage analysis showed that these two markers were on both sides of xa34(t) with the genetic distances 4.29 and 3.05 cM, respectively. The other 50 SSR markers in this region were used for genes' fine mapping. The further results indicated that xa34(t) was mapped to a 1.42 cM genetic region between RM10927 and RM10591. In order to further narrow down the genomic region of xa34(t), 43 of insertion/deletion (Indel) markers (BGID1-43) were designed according to the sequences comparison between japonica and indica rice. Parents' polymorphic detection and linkage assay showed that the Indel marker BGID25 came closer to the target gene with a 0.4 cM genetic distance. A contig map corresponding to the locus was constructed based on the reference sequences aligned by the xa34(t) linked markers. Consequently, the locus of xa34(t) was defined to a 204 kb interval flanked by markers RM10929 and BGID25.
21278127	Distinct roles of protein disulfide isomerase and P5 sulfhydryl oxidoreductases in multiple pathways for oxidation of structurally diverse storage proteins in rice.	2011	Plant Cell	In the rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm, storage proteins are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which prolamins are sorted to protein bodies (PBs) called type-I PB (PB-I). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family oxidoreductase PDIL2;3, an ortholog of human P5, contains a conserved structural disulfide in the redox-inactive thioredoxin-like (TRX) domain and was efficiently targeted to the surface of PB-I in a redox active site-dependent manner, whereas PDIL1;1, an ortholog of human PDI, was localized in the ER lumen. Complementation analyses using PDIL1;1 knockout esp2 mutant indicated that the a and a' TRX domains of PDIL1;1 exhibited similar redox activities and that PDIL2;3 was unable to perform the PDIL1;1 functions. PDIL2;3 knockdown inhibited the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin (crP10) in the core of PB-I. Conversely, crP10 knockdown dispersed PDIL2;3 into the ER lumen. Glutathione S-transferase-PDIL2;3 formed a stable tetramer when it was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant PDIL2;3 tetramer facilitated α-globulin(C79F) mutant protein to form nonnative intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro. These results indicate that PDIL2;3 and PDIL1;1 are not functionally redundant in sulfhydryl oxidations of structurally diverse storage proteins and play distinct roles in PB development. We discuss PDIL2;3-dependent and PDIL2;3-independent oxidation pathways that sustain disulfide bonds of crP10 in PB-I.
21282525	Pollen semi-sterility1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein important for male meiosis, anther dehiscence, and fertility in rice.	2011	Plant Cell	In flowering plants, male meiosis produces four microspores, which develop into pollen grains and are released by anther dehiscence to pollinate female gametophytes. The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating male meiosis in rice (Oryza sativa) remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that PSS1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein. PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles. Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis. The PSS1-green fluorescent protein fusion is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of rice protoplasts. Substitution of a conserved Arg (Arg-289) to His in the PSS1 motor domain nearly abolishes its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity. Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant. Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice.
21284756	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering.	2011	Plant J	Oryza sativa (rice) flowers in response to photoperiod, and is a facultative short-day (SD) plant. Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome). On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice. We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the Hd1-deficient background. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd3 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a putative transcriptional regulator with two plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motifs. To identify the role of Ehd3 within the gene regulatory network for rice flowering, we compared the transcript levels of genes related to rice flowering in wild-type plants and ehd3 mutants. Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction. Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1. Our results demonstrate that the PHD-finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice.
21293909	Arabidopsis SAP5 functions as a positive regulator of stress responses and exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	AtSAP5, one of approximately 14 members of the Stress Associated Protein gene family in Arabidopsis, was identified by its expression in response to salinity, osmotic, drought and cold stress. AtSAP5 shows strong homology to OSISAP1, an A20/AN1-type zinc finger protein implicated in stress tolerance in rice. To evaluate the function of AtSAP5 in the regulation of abiotic stress responses, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that over-express AtSAP5 (35S::AtSAP5) were characterized, along with wild-type and T-DNA knock-down plants. Plants that over-express AtSAP5 showed increased tolerance to environmental challenges including salt stress, osmotic stress and water deficit. Comparison of gene expression patterns between 35S::AtSAP5 transgenic plants and wild-type plants under normal conditions and water deficit stress indicated that over-expression of AtSAP5 correlates with up-regulation of drought stress responsive gene expression. Analysis of transgenic plants that express GFP-AtSAP5 showed that it is localized primarily in nuclei of root cells and recombinant AtSAP5 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. These results indicate that AtSAP5 has E3 ligase activity and acts as a positive regulator of stress responses in Arabidopsis.
21297036	Rice MADS3 regulates ROS homeostasis during late anther development.	2011	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic C-class gene, MADS3, was previously shown to be required for stamen identity determination during early flower development. Here, we describe a role for MADS3 in regulating late anther development and pollen formation. Consistent with this role, MADS3 is highly expressed in the tapetum and microspores during late anther development, and a newly identified MADS3 mutant allele, mads3-4, displays defective anther walls, aborted microspores, and complete male sterility. During late anther development, mads3-4 exhibits oxidative stress-related phenotypes. Microarray analysis revealed expression level changes in many genes in mads3-4 anthers. Some of these genes encode proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis; among them is MT-1-4b, which encodes a type 1 small Cys-rich and metal binding protein. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that MADS3 is associated with the promoter of MT-1-4b, and recombinant MT-1-4b has superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Reducing the expression of MT-1-4b causes decreased pollen fertility and an increased level of superoxide anion in transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that MADS3 is a key transcriptional regulator that functions in rice male reproductive development, at least in part, by modulating ROS levels through MT-1-4b.
21307283	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis.	2011	Plant Cell	Multicellular organisms contain a large number of formins; however, their physiological roles in plants remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that formin homology 5 (FH5), a type II formin mutated in rice morphology determinant (rmd), plays a crucial role in determining rice (Oryza sativa) morphology. FH5/RMD encodes a formin-like protein consisting of an N-terminal phosphatase tensin (PTEN)-like domain, an FH1 domain, and an FH2 domain. The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape. Cytological analysis showed that rmd mutants have severe cell elongation defects and abnormal microtubule and microfilament arrays. FH5/RMD is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues, and its protein localization to the chloroplast surface is mediated by the PTEN domain. Biochemical assays demonstrated that recombinant FH5 protein can nucleate actin polymerization from monomeric G-actin or actin/profilin complexes, cap the barbed end of actin filaments, and bundle actin filaments in vitro. Moreover, FH5 can directly bind to and bundle microtubules through its FH2 domain in vitro. Our findings suggest that the rice formin protein FH5 plays a critical role in determining plant morphology by regulating actin dynamics and proper spatial organization of microtubules and microfilaments.
21307285	BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development.	2011	Plant Cell	The actin cytoskeleton is an important regulator of cell expansion and morphogenesis in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the actin cytoskeleton to these processes remain largely unknown. Here, we report the functional analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) FH5/BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (BUI1), which encodes a formin-type actin nucleation factor and affects cell expansion and plant morphogenesis in rice. The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response. Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion. Map-based cloning revealed that BUI1 encodes the class II formin FH5. FH5 contains a phosphatase tensin-like domain at its amino terminus and two highly conserved formin-homology domains, FH1 and FH2. In vitro biochemical analyses indicated that FH5 is capable of nucleating actin assembly from free or profilin-bound monomeric actin. FH5 also interacts with the barbed end of actin filaments and prevents the addition and loss of actin subunits from the same end. Interestingly, the FH2 domain of FH5 could bundle actin filaments directly and stabilize actin filaments in vitro. Consistent with these in vitro biochemical activities of FH5/BUI1, the amount of filamentous actin decreased, and the longitudinal actin cables almost disappeared in bui1 cells. The FH2 or FH1FH2 domains of FH5 could also bind to and bundle microtubules in vitro. Thus, our study identified a rice formin protein that regulates de novo actin nucleation and spatial organization of the actin filaments, which are important for proper cell expansion and rice morphogenesis.
21309865	Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice.	2011	Plant J	Organisms are covered extracellularly with cuticular waxes that consist of various fatty acids. In higher plants, extracellular waxes act as indispensable barriers to protect the plants from physical and biological stresses such as drought and pathogen attacks. However, the effect of fatty acid composition on plant development under normal growth conditions is not well understood. Here we show that the ONION1 (ONI1) gene, which encodes a fatty acid elongase (β-ketoacyl CoA synthase) involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, is required for correct fatty acid composition and normal shoot development in rice. oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very-long-chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination. These mutants also showed abnormal expression of a KNOX family homeobox gene. ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs. These results show that fatty acid elongase is required for formation of the outermost cell layer, and this layer is indispensable for entire shoot development in rice.
21309868	Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice.	2011	Plant J	Root hair growth requires intensive cell-wall modification. This study demonstrates that root hair-specific expansin As, a sub-clade of the cell wall-loosening expansin proteins, are required for root hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified a gene encoding EXPA17 (OsEXPA17) from a rice mutant with short root hairs. Promoter::reporter transgenic lines exhibited exclusive OsEXPA17 expression in root hair cells. The OsEXPA17 mutant protein (OsexpA17) contained a point mutation, causing a change in the amino acid sequence (Gly104→Arg). This amino acid alteration is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved disulfide bond in the mutant. Suppression of OsEXPA17 by RNA interference further confirmed requirement for the gene in root hair elongation. Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots. These results demonstrate that members of the root hair EXPA sub-clade play a crucial role in root hair cell elongation in Graminaceae.
21309870	Alternative targeting of Arabidopsis plastidic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD1 involves cysteine-dependent interaction with G6PD4 in the cytosol.	2011	Plant J	Arabidopsis peroxisomes contain an incomplete oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway (OPPP), consisting of 6-phosphogluconolactonase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase isoforms with peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS). To start the pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is required; however, G6PD isoforms with obvious C-terminal PTS1 or N-terminal PTS2 motifs are lacking. We used fluorescent reporter fusions to explore possibly hidden peroxisomal targeting information. Among the six Arabidopsis G6PD isoforms only plastid-predicted G6PD1 with free C-terminal end localized to peroxisomes. Detailed analyses identified SKY as an internal PTS1-like signal; however, in a medial G6PD1 reporter fusion with free N- and C-terminal ends this cryptic information was overruled by the transit peptide. Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed selective protein-protein interactions of G6PD1 with catalytically inactive G6PD4, and of both G6PD isoforms with plastid-destined thioredoxin m2 (Trx(m2) ). Serine replacement of redox-sensitive cysteines conserved in G6PD4 abolished the G6PD4-G6PD1 interaction, albeit analogous changes in G6PD1 did not. In planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) demonstrated that the G6PD4-G6PD1 interaction results in peroxisomal import. BiFC also confirmed the interaction of Trx(m2) with G6PD4 (or G6PD1) in plastids, but co-expression analyses revealed Trx(m2) -mediated retention of medial G6PD4 (but not G6PD1) reporter fusions in the cytosol that was stabilized by CxxC¹¹³S exchange in Trx(m2) . Based on preliminary findings with plastid-predicted rice G6PD isoforms, we dismiss Arabidopsis G6PD4 as non-functional. G6PD4 orthologs (new P0 class) apparently evolved to become cytosolic redox switches that confer thioredoxin-relayed alternative targeting to peroxisomes.
21316795	OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	The A20/AN1 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) play pivotal roles in animal immune responses and plant stress responses. From previous gibberellin (GA) microarray data and A20/AN1 ZFP family member association, we chose Oryza sativa dwarf rice with overexpression of gibberellin-induced gene (OsDOG) to examine its function in the GA pathway. OsDOG was induced by gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and repressed by the GA-synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol. Different transgenic lines with constitutive expression of OsDOG showed dwarf phenotypes due to deficiency of cell elongation. Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3. Adding exogenous GA rescued the constitutive expression phenotypes of the transgenic lines. OsDOG has a novel function in regulating GA homeostasis and in negative maintenance of plant cell elongation in rice.
21318369	Expression of the rice CDPK-7 in sorghum: molecular and phenotypic analyses.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important source for food, feed, and possesses many agronomic attributes attractive for a biofuels feedstock. A warm season crop originating from the semi-arid tropics, sorghum is relatively susceptible to both cold and freezing stress. Enhancing the ability of sorghum to tolerate cold and freezing offers a route to expand the acreage for production, and provides a potential drought avoidance strategy during flowering, an important parameter for protection of yield. Targeted perturbation of the signal transduction pathway, that is triggered by exposure to abiotic stress in plants, has been demonstrated in model systems as an avenue to augment tolerance. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are key players in a plant's response to environmental assaults. To test the impact of modulating CDPK activity in sorghum as a means to enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, we introduced a constitutively expressed rice CDPK-7 (OsCDPK-7) gene construct. Sorghum transformants carrying this cassette, were not improved in cold or salt stress under the conditions tested. However, a lesion mimic phenotype and up-regulation of a number of pathogen related proteins, along with transcripts linked to photosynthesis were observed. These results demonstrate that modulating the Ca signaling cascade in planta via unregulated enhanced CDPK activity can lead to off-type effects likely due to the broadly integrated nature of these enzymes in signaling.
21318372	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of dense and erect panicle 3, DEP3, which confers high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Architecture of the rice inflorescence, which is determined mainly by the morphology, number and length of primary and secondary inflorescence branches, is an important agronomical trait. In the current study, we characterized a novel dense and erect panicle (EP) mutant, dep3, derived from the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Hwacheong treated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. The panicle of the dep3 mutant remained erect from flowering to full maturation, whereas the panicle of the wild type plant began to droop after flowering. The dep3 mutation also regulated other panicle characteristics, including panicle length, grain shape and grain number per panicle. Anatomical observations revealed that the dep3 mutant had more small vascular bundles and a thicker culm than wild type plants, explaining the EP phenotype. Genetic analysis indicated that the phenotype with the dense and EP was controlled by a single recessive gene, termed dep3. The DEP3 gene was identified as the candidate via a map-based cloning approach and was predicted to encode a patatin-like phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily domain-containing protein. The mutant allele gene carried a 408 bp genomic deletion within LOC_Os06g46350, which included the last 47 bp coding region of the third exon and the first 361 bp of the 3'-untranslated region. Taken together, our results indicated that the patatin-like PLA2 might play a significant role in the formation of vascular bundles, and that the dep3 mutant may provide another EP resource for rice breeding programs.
21325138	Mutation of rice BC12/GDD1, which encodes a kinesin-like protein that binds to a GA biosynthesis gene promoter, leads to dwarfism with impaired cell elongation.	2011	Plant Cell	The kinesins are a family of microtubule-based motor proteins that move directionally along microtubules and are involved in many crucial cellular processes, including cell elongation in plants. Less is known about kinesins directly regulating gene transcription to affect cellular physiological processes. Here, we describe a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, gibberellin-deficient dwarf1 (gdd1), that has a phenotype of greatly reduced length of root, stems, spikes, and seeds. This reduced length is due to decreased cell elongation and can be rescued by exogenous gibberellic acid (GA₃) treatment. GDD1 was cloned by a map-based approach, was expressed constitutively, and was found to encode the kinesin-like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (BC12). Microtubule cosedimentation assays revealed that BC12/GDD1 bound to microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed the expression of ent-kaurene oxidase (KO2), which encodes an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, was downregulated in gdd1. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GDD1 bound to the element ACCAACTTGAA in the KO2 promoter. In addition, GDD1 was shown to have transactivation activity. The level of endogenous GAs was reduced in gdd1, and the reorganization of cortical microtubules was altered. Therefore, BC12/GDD1, a kinesin-like protein with transcription regulation activity, mediates cell elongation by regulating the GA biosynthesis pathway in rice.
21327937	High-resolution genetic mapping and candidate gene identification of the SLP1 locus that controls glume development in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Stunted lemma palea 1 (slp1) is a rice mutant that displays dwarfism, shortened inflorescence lengths, severely degenerated lemmas/paleas, and sterility. The SLP1 locus was mapped between markers RM447 and D275 in the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 8, using the F2 progeny derived from the cross between the Slp1/slp1 mutant (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica) and the variety Taichung Native 1 (TN1, O. sativa subsp. indica). The SLP1 locus was further delimited to a 46.4-kb genomic region containing three putative genes: OsSPL16, OsMADS45, and OsMADS37. Comparisons of the sequence variations and expression levels of the three candidate genes between wild-type plants and homozygous slp1 mutants suggested that a missense mutation in the sixth amino acid of the OsSPL16 protein was likely responsible for the slp1 mutant phenotypes.
21331630	OsIRO2 is responsible for iron utilization in rice and improves growth and yield in calcareous soil.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Iron (Fe) deficiency, a worldwide agricultural problem on calcareous soil with low Fe availability, is also a major human nutritional deficit. Plants induce Fe acquisition systems under conditions of low Fe availability. Previously, we reported that an Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, OsIRO2, is responsible for regulation of the genes involved in Fe homeostasis in rice. Using promoter-GUS transformants, we showed that OsIRO2 is expressed throughout a plant's lifetime in a spatially and temporally similar manner to the genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and TOM1, which is involved in Fe absorption and translocation. During germination, OsIRO2 expression was detected in embryos. OsIRO2 expression in vegetative tissues was restricted almost exclusively to vascular bundles of roots and leaves, and to the root exodermis under Fe-sufficient conditions, and expanded to all tissues of roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. OsIRO2 expression was also detected in flowers and developing seeds. Plants overexpressing OsIRO2 grew better, and OsIRO2-repressed plants showed poor growth compared to non-transformant rice after germination. OsIRO2 overexpression also resulted in improved tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soil. In addition to increased Fe content in shoots, the overexpression plants accumulated higher amounts of Fe in seeds than non-transformants when grown on calcareous soil. These results suggest that OsIRO2 is synchronously expressed with genes involved in Fe homeostasis, and performs a crucial function in regulation not only of Fe uptake from soil but also Fe transport during germination and Fe translocation to grain during seed maturation.
20926385	Identification of a residue in helix 2 of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins that influences water permeability.	2010	J Biol Chem	Molecular selection, ion exclusion, and water permeation are well known regulatory mechanisms in aquaporin. Water permeability was found to be diverse in different subgroups of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), even though the residues surrounding the water holes remained the same across the subgroups. Upon homology modeling and structural comparison, a conserved Ala/Ile(Val) residue difference was identified in helix 2 that affected the conformation of the NPA region and consequently influenced the water permeability. The residue difference was found to be conservative within the two subgroups of PIPs in rice as well as in other plants. Functional tests further confirmed the prediction via site-directed mutagenesis where replacement of Ala(103) or Ala(102) in respective OsPIP1;1 or OsPIP1;3 with Val yielded 7.0- and 2.2-fold increases in water transportation, and substitution of Ile(98) or Val(95) in respective OsPIP2;3 or OsPIP2;7 with Ala resulted in 73 or 52% reduction of water transportation. Based on structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed that the difference in water permeability was attributed to the orientation variations of helix 2 that modified water-water and water-protein interactions.
21178306	Allelic interaction at seed-shattering loci in the genetic backgrounds of wild and cultivated rice species.	2010	Genes Genet Syst	It is known that the common cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated from Asian wild rice, O. rufipogon. Among the morphological differences between them, loss of seed shattering is one of the striking characters specific for the cultivated forms. In order to understand the genetic control on shattering habit, QTL analysis was carried out using BC(2)F(1) backcross population between O. sativa cv. Nipponbare (a recurrent parent) and O. rufipogon acc. W630 (a donor parent). As a result, two strong QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1 and 4, and they were found to be identical to the two major seed-shattering loci, qSH1 and sh4, respectively. The allelic interaction at these loci was further examined using two sets of backcross populations having reciprocal genetic backgrounds, cultivated and wild. In the genetic background of cultivated rice, the wild qSH1 allele has stronger effect on seed shattering than that of sh4. In addition, the wild alleles at both qSH1 and sh4 loci showed semi-dominant effects. On the other hand, in the genetic background of wild rice, non-shattering effects of Nipponbare alleles at both loci were examined to inspect rice domestication from a viewpoint of seed shattering. It was serendipitous that the backcross plants individually having Nipponbare homozygous alleles at either shattering locus (qSH1 or sh4) shed all the seeds. This fact strongly indicates that the non-shattering behavior was not obtained by a single mutation in the genetic background of wild rice. Probably, some other minor genes are still associated with the formation or activation of abscission layer, which enhance the seed shattering.
21217807	Dissecting the genetic basis for the effect of rice chalkiness, amylose content, protein content, and rapid viscosity analyzer profile characteristics on the eating quality of cooked rice using the chromosome segment substitution line population across eight environments.	2011	Genome	Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and stability analysis were carried out for 16 rice (Oryza sativa L.) quality traits across eight environments, by using a set of chromosome segment substitution lines with 'Asominori' as genetic background. The 16 quality traits include percentage of grain with chalkiness (PGWC), area of chalky endosperm (ACE), amylose content (AC), protein content (PC), peak viscosity, hot paste viscosity, cool paste viscosity, breakdown viscosity (BDV), setback viscosity (SBV), consistency viscosity, cooked-rice luster (LT), scent, tenderness (TD), viscosity, elasticity, and the integrated values of organleptic evaluation (IVOE). A total of 132 additive effect QTLs are detected for the 16 quality straits in the eight environments. Among these QTLs, 56 loci were detected repeatedly in at least three environments. Interestingly, several QTL clusters were observed for multiple quality traits. Especially, one QTL cluster near the G1149 marker on chromosome 8 includes nine QTLs: qPGWC-8, qACE-8, qAC-8, qPC-8a, qBDV-8a, qSBV-8b, qLT-8a, qTD-8a, and qIVOE-8a, which control PGWC, ACE, AC, PC, BDV, SBV, LT, TD, and IVOE, respectively. Moreover, this QTL cluster shows high stability and repeatability in all eight environments. In addition, one QTL cluster was located near the C2340 marker on chromosome 1 and another was detected near the XNpb67 marker on chromosome 2; each cluster contained five loci. Near the C563 marker on chromosome 3, one QTL cluster with four loci was found. Also, there were nine QTL clusters that each had two or three loci; however, their repeatability in different environments was relatively lower, and the genetic contribution rate was relatively smaller. Considering the correlations among all of the 16 quality traits with QTL cluster distributions, we can conclude that the stable and major QTL cluster on chromosome 8 is the main genetic basis for the effect of rice chalkiness, AC, PC, and rapid viscosity analyzer profile characteristics on the eating quality of cooked rice. Consequently, this QTL cluster is a novel gene resource for controlling rice high-quality traits and should be of great significance for research on formation mechanism and molecule improvement of rice quality.
21037241	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Lysine is the most deficient essential amino acid in cereal grains. A bifunctional lysine-degrading enzyme, lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH), is one of the key regulators determining free lysine content in plants. In rice (Oryza sativa. L), a bifunctional OsLKR/SDH is predominantly present in seeds. Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF. OsLKR/SDH was highly expressed in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm. Mutation analyses in planta, trans-activation reporter assays in vivo and electrophorestic mobility shift assays in vitro showed that the RPBF-recognizing prolamin box (AAAG) and the RISBZ1-recognizing GCN4 motif (TGAG/CTCA) act as important cis-elements for proper expression of OsLKR/SDH like SSP genes. However, mutation of the GCN4 motif within ProOsLKR/SDH did not alter the spatial expression pattern, whereas mutation of the GCN4 motif within ProGluB-1 did alter spatial expression. Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain. This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively. The same combinations of TF and cis-elements are involved in the regulation of OsLKR/SDH and SSP genes, but there is a distinct difference in their regulation mechanisms.
20938801	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Plant Mol Biol	In this article, we report an independent work of positional cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene in rice. The merit of our work is that we used a genuine null mutant, in which the wild-type allele was completely deleted. This allowed us to identify the mutant phenotypes accurately without the interference of residual function of the target gene. OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase. But its main and crucial roles are in regulating the development of all floral organs, especially in specifying the identity of stamens. Interestingly, OsJAG does not affect the number of floral organ primordial and so of floral organs in each whorl, suggesting that OsJAG does not influence the initiation of floral organ primordia, but affect the developmental fate of all floral organs after their primordia have initiated. Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil. The stamen appears to be more sensitive to the mutation. All the six stamens in a mutant floret were thoroughly transformed into six pistil-like organs developed at the presumptive positions of the stamens in whorl 3.
21062870	Rice expression atlas in reproductive development.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Gene expression throughout the reproductive process in rice (Oryza sativa) beginning with primordia development through pollination/fertilization to zygote formation was analyzed. We analyzed 25 stages/organs of rice reproductive development including early microsporogenesis stages with 57,381 probe sets, and identified around 26,000 expressed probe sets in each stage. Fine dissection of 25 reproductive stages/organs combined with detailed microarray profiling revealed dramatic, coordinated and finely tuned changes in gene expression. A decrease in expressed genes in the pollen maturation process was observed in a similar way with Arabidopsis and maize. An almost equal number of ab initio predicted genes and cloned genes which appeared or disappeared coordinated with developmental stage progression. A large number of organ-/stage-specific genes were identified; notably 2,593 probe sets for developing anther, including 932 probe sets corresponding to ab initio predicted genes. Analysis of cell cycle-related genes revealed that several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), cyclins and components of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were expressed specifically in reproductive organs. Cell wall biosynthesis or degradation protein genes and transcription factor genes expressed specifically in reproductive stages were also newly identified. Rice genes homologous to reproduction-related genes in other plants showed expression profiles both consistent and inconsistent with their predicted functions. The rice reproductive expression atlas is likely to be the most extensive and most comprehensive data set available, indispensable for unraveling functions of many specific genes in plant reproductive processes that have not yet been thoroughly analyzed.
20941508	Global expression profiling of rice microRNAs by one-tube stem-loop reverse transcription quantitative PCR revealed important roles of microRNAs in abiotic stress responses.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous small RNA molecules (20-24 nucleotides) that have pivotal roles in regulating gene expression mostly at posttranscriptional levels in plants. Plant microRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of diverse biological processes including growth and stress responses. However, the information about microRNAs in regulating abiotic stress responses in rice is limited. We optimized a one-tube stem-loop reverse transcription quantitative PCR (ST-RT qPCR) for high-throughput expression profiling analysis of microRNAs in rice under normal and stress conditions. The optimized ST-RT qPCR method was as accurate as small RNA gel blotting and was more convenient and time-saving than other methods in quantifying microRNAs. With this method, 41 rice microRNAs were quantified for their relative expression levels after drought, salt, cold, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Thirty-two microRNAs showed induced or suppressed expression after stress or ABA treatment. Further analysis suggested that stress-responsive cis-elements were enriched in the promoters of stress-responsive microRNA genes. The expressions of five and seven microRNAs were significantly affected in the rice plant with defects in stress tolerance regulatory genes OsSKIPa and OsbZIP23, respectively. Some of the predicted target genes of these microRNAs were also related to abiotic stresses. We conclude that ST-RT qPCR is an efficient and reliable method for expression profiling of microRNAs and a significant portion of rice microRNAs participate in abiotic stress response and regulation.
20949308	Molecular characterization, expression pattern, and functional analysis of the OsIRL gene family encoding intracellular Ras-group-related LRR proteins in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Leucine-rich repeat proteins constitute a large gene family and play important roles in plant growth and development. Among them, Arabidopsis PIRL is a plant-specific class of intracellular Ras-group-related leucine-rich repeat proteins. In this study, we identified eight homologues of PIRLs in rice and designated them as OsIRL proteins. We described the gene structures, chromosome localizations, protein motifs, and phylogenetic relationships of the OsIRL gene family. The expression profiles of OsIRL genes were analyzed throughout the entire rice life cycle, along with light and three hormone stress conditions, using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray data. All OsIRL genes were expressed in at least one experimental stage and exhibited divergent expression patterns, with several genes showing preferential expression at specific stages. OsIRL4 and OsIRL5 showed higher expression levels under light compared to dark. OsIRL4 and OsIRL7 exhibited significant differential expression in response to hormone treatments. Six T-DNA or Tos17 insertion lines for five individual OsIRL genes were identified and examined morphologically. The comprehensive expression profile elucidated in this investigation together with the characterized insertion lines will provide a solid foundation for in-depth dissection of OsIRL functions.
21097897	OsLEA1a, a new Em-like protein of cereal plants.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Proteins abundant in seeds during the late stages of development, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, are associated with desiccation tolerance. More than 100 of the group I LEA genes, also termed Em genes, have been identified from plants, bacteria and animals. The wide distribution indicates the functional importance of these genes. In the present study, we characterized a novel Em-like gene, OsLEA1a of rice (Oryza sativa). The encoded OsLEA1a protein has an N-terminal sequence similar to that of other plant Em proteins but lacks a 20-mer motif that is the most significant feature of typical Em proteins. The location of the sole intron indicates that the second exon of OsLEA1a is the mutated product of a typical Em gene. Transcriptome analysis revealed OsLEA1a mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues. Structural analysis revealed that the OsLEA1a protein adopts high amounts of disordered conformations in solution and undergoes desiccation-induced conformational changes. Macromolecular interaction studies revealed that OsLEA1a protein interacts with non-reducing sugars and phospholipids but not poly-l-lysine. Thus, although the OsLEA1a protein lost its 20-mer motif, it is still involved in the formation of bioglasses with non-reducing sugars or plasma membrane. However, the protein does not function as a chaperone as do other groups of hydrophilic LEA proteins. The orthologs of the OsLEA1a gene had been identified from various grasses but not in dicot plants. Genetic analysis indicated that rice OsLEA1a locates at a 193 kb segment in chromosome 1 and is conserved in several published cereal genomes. Thus, the ancestor of Em-like genes might have evolved after the divergence of monocot plants.
21051443	Pdk1 kinase regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice. In eukaryotes, AGC kinase family proteins are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1). In Arabidopsis, AtPdk1 directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, which functions as a second messenger in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the functions of Pdk1 are poorly understood in plants. We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice. OsPdk1 interacts with OsOxi1 and phosphorylates the Ser283 residue of OsOxi1 in vitro. To investigate whether OsPdk1 is involved in immunity that is triggered by microbial-associated molecular patterns, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of OsPdk1 in response to chitin elicitor. Like OsOxi1, OsPdk1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to chitin elicitor, suggesting that OsPdk1 participates in signal transduction through pathogen recognition. The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.
20971065	Transgenically expressed rice germin-like protein1 in tobacco causes hyper-accumulation of H2O2 and reinforcement of the cell wall components.	2010	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (OsGLP1), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco. In the present study, the transgenic tobacco plants were analyzed further to decipher the detailed physiological and biochemical functions of the OsGLP1 and its associated SOD activity. The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active OsGLP1 showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H(2)O(2) upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively. Histological staining revealed enhanced cross-linking of the cell wall components in the stem tissues of the transgenic plants. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the biopolymer from the stem tissues of the transgenic and untransformed plants revealed differential banding pattern of the spectra corresponding to various functional groups. Our findings demonstrate that the OsGLP1 with its inherent SOD activity is responsible for hyper-accumulation of H(2)O(2) and reinforcement of the cell wall components.
20876569	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein.	2010	J Biol Chem	YchF is a subfamily of the Obg family in the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases. The wide distribution of YchF homologues in both eukarya and bacteria suggests that they are descendents of an ancient protein, yet their physiological roles remain unclear. Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1). The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed. The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants. This work suggests that during evolution, an ancestral P-loop GTPase/ATPase may acquire new regulation and function(s) by the evolution of a lineage-specific regulatory protein.
21107422	Sugar transporters for intercellular exchange and nutrition of pathogens.	2010	Nature	Sugar efflux transporters are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development. Despite broad biological importance, the identity of sugar efflux transporters has remained elusive. Using optical glucose sensors, we identified a new class of sugar transporters, named SWEETs, and show that at least six out of seventeen Arabidopsis, two out of over twenty rice and two out of seven homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the single copy human protein, mediate glucose transport. Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain. The metazoan homologues may be involved in sugar efflux from intestinal, liver, epididymis and mammary cells.
20888318	Rice ternary MADS protein complexes containing class B MADS heterodimer.	2010	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	To investigate ternary MADS protein complexes involved in the regulation of floral organ development in rice, we identified MADS proteins interacting with the class B MADS heterodimers, OsMADS16-OsMADS4 and OsMADS16-OsMADS2, using yeast three-hybrid assay. The class B heterodimers interacted with OsMADS6, 7, 8, 14 and 17, which belong to AP1-like, SEP-like or AGL6-like MADS proteins, generating ternary complexes. The entire region of the K and C domains of OsMADS4 was required for the formation of the OsMADS16-OsMADS4-OsMADS6 and OsMADS16-OsMADS4-OsMADS7 ternary complexes. Analysis results of transgenic plants concomitantly suppressing OsMADS4 and OsMADS6, together with the results of previous studies, suggest that the OsMADS16-OsMADS4-OsMADS6 ternary complex plays an important role in floral development, especially lodicule development.
20937890	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, but its trivalent ionic form is highly toxic to all organisms at low concentrations. How Al enters cells has not been elucidated in any organisms. Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice. Nrat1 belongs to the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family, but shares a low similarity with other Nramp members. When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex. Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells. Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals. Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1). We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles.
20878348	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Seed germination is an important character for plant growth and seed quality. We identified a rice mutant that was delayed in its germination. There, T-DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation. Overexpression of the gene enhanced seed germination. OsDSG1 is most similar to Arabidopsis AIP2, an E3 ligase targeting ABI3.Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that our OsDSG1 binds to OsABI3, indicating that OsDSG1 is a rice ortholog of AIP2. Self-ubiquitination assay indicated that bacterially expressed OsDSG1 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds. In addition to the delayed-germination phenotype, mutant plants were shorter and had greater tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses. In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased. By contrast, expressions of OsGAMYB and its downstream genes that encode hydrolytic enzymes were markedly reduced. These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds. Finally, we observed that the germination rates of various rice cultivars depended upon the transcript levels of OsDSG1 and other ABA-signaling genes.
20849820	Crystallographic analysis reveals a unique conformation of the ADP-bound novel rice kinesin K16.	2010	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical studies revealed that the novel rice plant-specific kinesin K16 has several unique enzymatic characteristics as compared to conventional kinesins. The ADP-free form of K16 is very stable, whereas the ADP-free form of conventional kinesins is labile. In the present study, the crystal structure of the novel rice kinesin motor domain (K16MD) complexed with Mg-ADP was determined at 2.4 Å resolutions. The overall structure of K16MD is similar to that of conventional kinesin motor domains, as expected from the high amino acid sequence similarity (43.2%). However, several unique structures in K16 were observed. The position and length of the L5, L11, and L12 loops, which are key functional regions, were different from those observed in conventional kinesins. Moreover, the neck-linker region of the ADP-bound K16MD showed an ordered conformation at a position quite different from that previously observed in conventional kinesins. These structural differences may reflect the unique enzymatic characteristics of rice kinesin K16.
20713616	Coexpression analysis identifies Rice Starch Regulator1, a rice AP2/EREBP family transcription factor, as a novel rice starch biosynthesis regulator.	2010	Plant Physiol	Starch biosynthesis is important for plant development and is a critical factor in crop quality and nutrition. As a complex metabolic pathway, the regulation of starch biosynthesis is still poorly understood. We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch biosynthesis by gene coexpression analysis in rice (Oryza sativa). Starch synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in seeds; sink tissues) and type II (in vegetative tissues; source tissues), and 307 and 621 coexpressed genes are putatively involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice seeds and vegetative tissues, respectively. Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1), an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and RSR1 deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds. Seeds of the knockout mutant rsr1 consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature. In addition, rsr1 mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield. In contrast, RSR1 overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature. Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in rsr1 results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in RSR1-overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch. These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of RSR1, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition.
20962882	Genetic effects of major QTLs controlling low-temperature germinability in different genetic backgrounds in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Genome	The effects of QTLs are demonstrated basically within the population used in the original QTL analysis as the difference between the alleles of the parental varieties. For the efficient use of QTLs in breeding programs, it is necessary to assess whether the QTL exhibits its genetic effect when it is introgressed into different genetic backgrounds. Extensive studies of tolerance to low temperature at the seed germination stage (called low-temperature germinability) in rice revealed that 2 major QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 11, qLTG3-1 and qLTG11, have large effects. This study assessed the effects of these 2 QTLs from an aus variety, Kasalath, in different genetic backgrounds of 3 japonica varieties, Hoshinoyume, Hayamasari, and Koshihikari. Backcrossed progenies and chromosome segment substitution lines showed that both qLTG3-1 and qLTG11 were effective in the Hoshinoyume and Koshihikari backgrounds, while only qLTG3-1 was effective in the Hayamasari background. The results in this study demonstrated that these 2 QTLs are useful for the improvement of low-temperature germinability in rice breeding programs. The results also indicated that low-temperature germinability in rice is governed by an epistatic interaction of qLTG11.
21070404	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice.	2010	Plant J	Chitin is a major molecular pattern for various fungi, and its fragments, chitin oligosaccharides, are known to induce various defense responses in plant cells. A plasma membrane glycoprotein, CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) and a receptor kinase, CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase) (also known as LysM-RLK1), were identified as critical components for chitin signaling in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. However, it is not known whether each plant species requires both of these two types of molecules for chitin signaling, nor the relationships between these molecules in membrane signaling. We report here that rice cells require a LysM receptor-like kinase, OsCERK1, in addition to CEBiP, for chitin signaling. Knockdown of OsCERK1 resulted in marked suppression of the defense responses induced by chitin oligosaccharides, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for chitin signaling in rice. The results of a yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that both CEBiP and OsCERK1 have the potential to form hetero- or homo-oligomers. Immunoprecipitation using a membrane preparation from rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharides suggested the ligand-induced formation of a receptor complex containing both CEBiP and OsCERK1. Blue native PAGE and chemical cross-linking experiments also suggested that a major portion of CEBiP exists as homo-oligomers even in the absence of chitin oligosaccharides.
21115813	An NADPH-dependent genetic switch regulates plant infection by the rice blast fungus.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae breaches the tough outer cuticle of the rice leaf by using specialized infection structures called appressoria. These cells allow the fungus to invade the host plant and proliferate rapidly within leaf tissue. Here, we show that a unique NADPH-dependent genetic switch regulates plant infection in response to the changing nutritional and redox conditions encountered by the pathogen. The biosynthetic enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) integrates control of glucose-6-phosphate metabolism and nitrogen source utilization by regulating the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the generation of NADPH, and the activity of nitrate reductase. We report that Tps1 directly binds to NADPH and, thereby, regulates a set of related transcriptional corepressors, comprising three proteins, Nmr1, Nmr2, and Nmr3, which can each bind NADP. Targeted deletion of any of the Nmr-encoding genes partially suppresses the nonpathogenic phenotype of a Δtps1 mutant. Tps1-dependent Nmr corepressors control the expression of a set of virulence-associated genes that are derepressed during appressorium-mediated plant infection. When considered together, these results suggest that initiation of rice blast disease by M. oryzae requires a regulatory mechanism involving an NADPH sensor protein, Tps1, a set of NADP-dependent transcriptional corepressors, and the nonconsuming interconversion of NADPH and NADP acting as signal transducer.
20940349	Reducing rice seed storage protein accumulation leads to changes in nutrient quality and storage organelle formation.	2010	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) seed storage proteins (SSPs) are synthesized and deposited in storage organelles in the endosperm during seed maturation as a nitrogen source for germinating seedlings. We have generated glutelin, globulin, and prolamin knockdown lines and have examined their effects on seed quality. A reduction of one or a few SSP(s) was compensated for by increases in other SSPs at both the mRNA and protein levels. Especially, reduction of glutelins or sulfur-rich 10-kD prolamin levels was preferentially compensated by sulfur-poor or other sulfur-rich prolamins, respectively, indicating that sulfur-containing amino acids are involved in regulating SSP composition. Furthermore, a reduction in the levels of 13-kD prolamin resulted in enhancement of the total lysine content by 56% when compared with the wild type. This observation can be mainly accounted for by the increase in lysine-rich proteins. Although reducing the level of glutelins slightly decreased protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), the simultaneous reduction of glutelin and globulin levels altered the inner structure of PSVs, implicating globulin in framing PSV formation. Knock down of 13-kD prolamins not only reduced the size of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies (PBs) but also altered the rugged peripheral structure. In contrast, PBs became slightly smaller or unchanged by severe suppression of 10- or 16-kD prolamins, respectively, indicating that individual prolamins have distinct functions in the formation of PBs. Extreme increases or decreases in sulfur-poor prolamins resulted in the production of small PBs, suggesting that the ratio of individual prolamins is crucial for proper aggregation and folding of prolamins.
20959420	Global gene profiling of laser-captured pollen mother cells indicates molecular pathways and gene subfamilies involved in rice meiosis.	2010	Plant Physiol	Pollen mother cells (PMCs) represent a critical early stage in plant sexual reproduction in which the stage is set for male gamete formation. Understanding the global molecular genetics of this early meiotic stage has so far been limited to whole stamen or floret transcriptome studies, but since PMCs are a discrete population of cells in developmental synchrony, they provide the potential for precise transcriptome analysis and for enhancing our understanding of the transition to meiosis. As a step toward identifying the premeiotic transcriptome, we performed microarray analysis on a homogenous population of rice (Oryza sativa) PMCs isolated by laser microdissection and compared them with those of tricellular pollen and seedling. Known meiotic genes, including OsSPO11-1, PAIR1, PAIR2, PAIR3, OsDMC1, OsMEL1, OsRAD21-4, OsSDS, and ZEP1, all showed preferential expression in PMCs. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways significantly enriched in PMC-preferential genes are DNA replication and repair pathways. Our genome-wide survey showed that, in the buildup to meiosis, PMCs accumulate the molecular machinery for meiosis at the mRNA level. We identified 1,158 PMC-preferential genes and suggested candidate genes and pathways involved in meiotic recombination and meiotic cell cycle control. Regarding the developmental context for meiosis, the DEF-like, AGL2-like, and AGL6-like subclades of MADS box transcription factors are PMC-preferentially expressed, the trans-zeatin type of cytokinin might be preferentially synthesized, and the gibberellin signaling pathway is likely active in PMCs. The ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway is enriched in the 127 genes that are expressed in PMCs but not in tricellular pollen or seedling.
21105928	OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells.	2010	Plant J	Rice glutelins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as precursors (pro-glutelins), and are transported to protein storage vacuoles, where they are processed into mature proteins. The molecular basis of this process is largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures. Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted. The gene corresponding to the gpa1 mutation was found to be OsRab5a, which encodes a small GTPase. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, OsRab5a protein was found to co-localize predominantly with AtVSR2, a molecular marker for the pre-vacuolar compartments (PVC). We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice.
20924648	Role of OsNPR1 in rice defense program as revealed by genome-wide expression analysis.	2010	Plant Mol Biol	NPR1 is a central regulator of salicylic-acid (SA)-mediated defense signaling in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the characterization of OsNPR1, an Oryzae sativa (rice) ortholog of NPR1, focusing on its role in blast disease resistance and identification of OsNPR1-regulated genes. Blast resistance tests using OsNPR1 knockdown and overexpressing rice lines demonstrated the essential role of OsNPR1 in benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced blast resistance. Genome-wide transcript profiling using OsNPR1-knockdown lines revealed that 358 genes out of 1,228 BTH-upregulated genes and 724 genes out of 1,069 BTH-downregulated genes were OsNPR1-dependent with respect to BTH responsiveness, thereby indicating that OsNPR1 plays a more vital role in gene downregulation. The OsNPR1-dependently downregulated genes included many of those involved in photosynthesis and in chloroplast translation and transcription. Reduction of photosynthetic activity after BTH treatment and its negation by OsNPR1 knockdown were indeed reflected in the changes in Fv/Fm values in leaves. These results imply the role of OsNPR1 in the reallocation of energy and resources during defense responses. We also examined the OsNPR1-dependence of SA-mediated suppression of ABA-induced genes.
21062869	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Here we report on the characterization of rice osa-miR827 and its two target genes, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2, which encode SPX-MFS proteins predicted to be implicated in phosphate (Pi) sensing or transport. We first show by Northern blot analysis that osa-miR827 is strongly induced by Pi starvation in both shoots and roots. Hybridization of osa-miR827 in situ confirms its strong induction by Pi starvation, with signals concentrated in mesophyll, epidermis and ground tissues of roots. In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation. OsSPX-MFS1 mRNA is mainly expressed in shoots under sufficient Pi supply while its expression is reduced on Pi starvation, revealing a direct relationship between induction of osa-miR827 and down-regulation of OsSPX-MFS1. In contrast, OsSPX-MFS2 responds in a diametrically opposed manner to Pi starvation. The accumulation of OsSPX-MFS2 mRNA is dramatically enhanced under Pi starvation, suggesting the involvement of complex regulation of osa-miR827 and its two target genes. We further produced transgenic rice lines overexpressing osa-miR827 and T-DNA knockout mutant lines in which the expression of osa-miR827 is abolished. Compared with wild-type controls, both target mRNAs exhibit similar changes, their expression being reduced and increased in overexpressing and knockout lines, respectively. This suggests that OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions. We propose that this is a complex mechanism comprising fine tuning of spatial or temporal regulation of both targets by osa-miR827.
21041976	Identification of novel Mlo family members in wheat and their genetic characterization.	2010	Genes Genet Syst	Mlo is a plant-specific gene family, which is known to show stress responses in various plants. To reveal the genetic characteristics of the Mlo family in wheat, we isolated wheat Mlo members from a database and studied their expression in young shoots and roots under salt and osmotic stress conditions. In an in silico investigation, we identified seven Mlo members in wheat and named them TaMlo-1~TaMlo-7. None of the wheat Mlo showed significant induction or reduction of their expression under salt or osmotic stress, but organ-specific expression was observed in several TaMlo members. TaMlo-1, TaMlo-2, and TaMlo-5 were constitutively expressed in both shoots and roots, but TaMlo-3 and TaMlo-4 showed root-specific expression, and TaMlo-7 showed dominant expression in shoots. TaMlo-6 was weakly expressed in both shoots and roots. Phylogenetic analysis classified the plant Mlo members into six classes; four of them were comprised of angiosperm Mlo members, and the remaining two consisted of fern and moss Mlo members. The seven wheat Mlo members were classified into four angiosperm Mlo classes, similar to those of Arabidopsis and rice, indicating that the formation of each of the Mlo classes preceded the divergence of dicots and monocots. The differentiation of the expressional patterns among the seven TaMlo members was not related to their phylogenetic classification. This result suggested that the organ specific expression of individual Mlo members occurred relatively recently in their evolution.
21098734	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3.	2010	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) gene xa13 is a recessive resistance allele of Os-8N3, a member of the NODULIN3 (N3) gene family, located on rice chromosome 8. Os-8N3 is a susceptibility (S) gene for Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight, and the recessive allele is defeated by strains of the pathogen producing any one of the type III effectors AvrXa7, PthXo2, or PthXo3, which are all members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. Both AvrXa7 and PthXo3 induce the expression of a second member of the N3 gene family, here named Os-11N3. Insertional mutagenesis or RNA-mediated silencing of Os-11N3 resulted in plants with loss of susceptibility specifically to strains of X. oryzae pv oryzae dependent on AvrXa7 or PthXo3 for virulence. We further show that AvrXa7 drives expression of Os-11N3 and that AvrXa7 interacts and binds specifically to an effector binding element within the Os-11N3 promoter, lending support to the predictive models for TAL effector binding specificity. The result indicates that variations in the TAL effector repetitive domains are driven by selection to overcome both dominant and recessive forms of resistance to bacterial blight in rice. The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease.
21098733	A rice gid1 suppressor mutant reveals that gibberellin is not always required for interaction between its receptor, GID1, and DELLA proteins.	2010	Plant Cell	To investigate gibberellin (GA) signaling using the rice (Oryza sativa) GA receptor GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) mutant gid1-8, we isolated a suppressor mutant, Suppressor of gid1-1 (Sgd-1). Sgd-1 is an intragenic mutant containing the original gid1-8 mutation (L45F) and an additional amino acid substitution (P99S) in the loop region. GID1(P99S) interacts with the rice DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), even in the absence of GA. Substitution of the 99th Pro with other amino acids revealed that substitution with Ala (P99A) caused the highest level of GA-independent interaction. Physicochemical analysis using surface plasmon resonance revealed that GID1(P99A) has smaller K(a) (association) and K(d) (dissociation) values for GA(4) than does wild-type GID1. This suggests that the GID1(P99A) lid is at least partially closed, resulting in both GA-independent and GA-hypersensitive interactions with SLR1. One of the three Arabidopsis thaliana GID1s, At GID1b, can also interact with DELLA proteins in the absence of GA, so we investigated whether GA-independent interaction of At GID1b depends on a mechanism similar to that of rice GID1(P99A). Substitution of the loop region or a few amino acids of At GID1b with those of At GID1a diminished its GA-independent interaction with GAI while maintaining the GA-dependent interaction. Soybean (Glycine max) and Brassica napus also have GID1s similar to At GID1b, indicating that these unique GID1s occur in various dicots and may have important functions in these plants.
20889913	A novel factor FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 is involved in regulation of rice grain size and starch quality.	2010	Plant Cell	Rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm accumulates a massive amount of storage starch and storage proteins during seed development. However, little is known about the regulatory system involved in the production of storage substances. The rice flo2 mutation resulted in reduced grain size and starch quality. Map-based cloning identified FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2), a member of a novel gene family conserved in plants, as the gene responsible for the rice flo2 mutation. FLO2 harbors a tetratricopeptide repeat motif, considered to mediate a protein-protein interactions. FLO2 was abundantly expressed in developing seeds coincident with production of storage starch and protein, as well as in leaves, while abundant expression of its homologs was observed only in leaves. The flo2 mutation decreased expression of genes involved in production of storage starch and storage proteins in the endosperm. Differences between cultivars in their responsiveness of FLO2 expression during high-temperature stress indicated that FLO2 may be involved in heat tolerance during seed development. Overexpression of FLO2 enlarged the size of grains significantly. These results suggest that FLO2 plays a pivotal regulatory role in rice grain size and starch quality by affecting storage substance accumulation in the endosperm.
21070413	Perception of the chitin oligosaccharides contributes to disease resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2010	Plant J	Chitin is a component of fungal cell walls, and its fragments act as elicitors in many plants. The plasma membrane glycoprotein CEBiP, which possesses LysM domains, is a receptor for the chitin elicitor (CE) in rice. Here, we report that the perception of CE by CEBiP contributes to disease resistance against the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and that enhanced responses to CE by engineering CEBiP increase disease tolerance. Knockdown of CEBiP expression allowed increased spread of the infection hyphae. To enhance defense responses to CE, we constructed chimeric genes composed of CEBiP and Xa21, which mediate resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight. The expression of either CRXa1 or CRXa3, each of which contains the whole extracellular portion of CEBiP, the whole intracellular domain of XA21, and the transmembrane domain from either CEBiP or XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after treatment with CE. Rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor exhibited necrotic lesions in response to CE and became more resistant to M. oryzae. Deletion of the first LysM domain in CRXA1 abolished these cellular responses. These results suggest that CEs are produced and recognized through the LysM domain of CEBiP during the interaction between rice and M. oryzae and imply that engineering pattern recognition receptors represents a new strategy for crop protection against fungal diseases.
20884799	Implementing a rational and consistent nomenclature for serine/arginine-rich protein splicing factors (SR proteins) in plants.	2010	Plant Cell	Growing interest in alternative splicing in plants and the extensive sequencing of new plant genomes necessitate more precise definition and classification of genes coding for splicing factors. SR proteins are a family of RNA binding proteins, which function as essential factors for constitutive and alternative splicing. We propose a unified nomenclature for plant SR proteins, taking into account the newly revised nomenclature of the mammalian SR proteins and a number of plant-specific properties of the plant proteins. We identify six subfamilies of SR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), three of which are plant specific. The proposed subdivision of plant SR proteins into different subfamilies will allow grouping of paralogous proteins and simple assignment of newly discovered SR orthologs from other plant species and will promote functional comparisons in diverse plant species.
20950890	Proteomics analysis of rice seedling responses to ovine saliva.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Grazing is accompanied by a multitude of processes including wounding, saliva deposition, and defoliation. Previous studies have focused on the effects of the grazing or clipping intensity on plant regrowth, survival, and composition in the grassland. However, the impact of saliva deposition on plants is poorly understood. In this study, rice was used as a model plant to study the differentially expressed proteins after ovine saliva treatment. The shoots of 2-week-old seedlings were crosscut and the lower parts were daubed with ovine saliva at the cut surface. After 2, 6, 12 and 24h, proteomics analysis was performed using proteins extracted from the saliva-treated shoots. The results showed that proteins involved in multiple pathways were differentially expressed in response to ovine saliva, including catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxin (Prx), ATP synthase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Moreover, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) data showed that most of the genes were also regulated at the transcript level. Our results indicate the ovine saliva induces an early response in the rice seedling by stress-related pathways. This study provides information about the response of rice seedlings to ovine saliva at the protein level.
20889230	Comparison of the role of gibberellins and ethylene in response to submergence of two lowland rice cultivars, Senia and Bomba.	2011	J Plant Physiol	We examined the gibberellin (GA) and ethylene regulation of submergence-induced elongation in seedlings of the submergence-tolerant lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs Senia and Bomba. Elongation was enhanced after germination to facilitate water escape and reach air. We found that submergence-induced elongation depends on GA because it was counteracted by paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis), an effect that was negated by GA(3). Moreover, in the cv Senia, submergence increased the content of active GA(1) and its immediate precursors (GA(53), GA(19) and GA(20)) by enhancing expression of several GA biosynthesis genes (OsGA20ox1 and -2, and OsGA3ox2), but not by decreasing expression of several OsGA2ox (GA inactivating genes). Senia seedlings, in contrast to Bomba seedlings, did not elongate in response to ethylene or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC; an ethylene precursor) application, and submergence-induced elongation was not reduced in the presence of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP; an ethylene perception inhibitor). Ethylene emanation was similar in Senia seedlings grown in air and in submerged-grown seedlings following de-submergence, while it increased in Bomba. The expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes (OsACS1, -2 and -3, and OsACO1) was not affected in Senia, but expression of OsACS5 was rapidly enhanced in Bomba upon submergence. Our results support the conclusion that submergence elongation enhancement of lowland rice is due to alteration of GA metabolism leading to an increase in active GA (GA(1)) content. Interestingly, in the cv Senia, in contrast to cv Bomba, this was triggered through an ethylene-independent mechanism.
21056641	Evolutionary analysis of three gibberellin oxidase genes in rice, Arabidopsis, and soybean.	2011	Gene	GAs are plant hormones that play fundamental roles in plant growth and development. GA2ox, GA3ox, and GA20ox are three key enzymes in GA biosynthesis. These enzymes belong to the 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase superfamily and are independently encoded by different gene families. To date, genome-wide comparative analyses of GA oxidases in plant species have not been thoroughly carried out. In the present work, 61 GA oxidase family genes from rice (Oryza sativa), Arabidopsis, and soybean (Glycine max) were identified and a full study of these genes including phylogenetic tree construction, gene structure, gene family expansion and analysis of functional motifs was performed. Based on phylogeny, most of the GA oxidases were divided into four subgroups that reflected functional classifications. Intron/intron average length of GA oxidase genes in rice analysis revealed that GA oxidase genes in rice experienced substantial evolutionary divergence. Segmental duplication events were mainly found in soybean genome. However, in rice and Arabidopsis, no single expansion pattern exhibited dominance, indicating that GA oxidase genes from these species might have been subjected to a more complex evolutionary mechanism. In addition, special functional motifs were discovered in GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox, which suggested that different functional motifs are associated with differences in protein function. Taken together our results suggest that GA oxidase family genes have undergone divergent evolutionary routes, especially at the monocot-dicot split, with dynamic evolution occurring in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean.
21265890	The fertility restorer gene, Rf2, for Lead Rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility of rice encodes a mitochondrial glycine-rich protein.	2011	Plant J	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is associated with a mitochondrial mutation that causes an inability to produce fertile pollen. The fertility of CMS plants is restored in the presence of a nuclear-encoded fertility restorer (Rf) gene. In Lead Rice-type CMS, discovered in the indica variety 'Lead Rice', fertility of the CMS plant is restored by the single nuclear-encoded gene Rf2 in a gametophytic manner. We performed map-based cloning of Rf2, and proved that it encodes a protein consisting of 152 amino acids with a glycine-rich domain. Expression of Rf2 mRNA was detected in developing and mature anthers. An RF2-GFP fusion was shown to be targeted to mitochondria. Replacement of isoleucine by threonine at amino acid 78 of the RF2 protein was considered to be the cause of functional loss in the rf2 allele. As Rf2 does not encode a pentatricopeptide repeat protein, unlike a majority of previously identified Rf genes, the data from this study provide new insights into the mechanism for restoring fertility in CMS.
21115808	Allelic variation in the perennial ryegrass FLOWERING LOCUS T gene is associated with changes in flowering time across a range of populations.	2011	Plant Physiol	The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene and its orthologs in other plant species (e.g. rice [Oryza sativa] OsFTL2/Hd3a) have an established role in the photoperiodic induction of flowering response. The genomic and phenotypic variations associated with the perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) ortholog of FT, designated LpFT3, was assessed in a diverse collection of nine European germplasm populations, which together constituted an association panel of 864 plants. Sequencing and genotyping of a series of amplicons derived from the nine populations, containing the complete exon and intron sequences as well as 5' and 3' noncoding sequences of LpFT3, identified a total of seven haplotypes. Genotyping assays designed to detect the genomic variation showed that three haplotypes were present in approximately equal proportions and represented 84% of the total, with a fourth representing a further 11%. Of the three major haplotypes, two were predicted to code for identical protein products and the third contained two amino acid substitutions. Association analysis using either a mixed model with a relationship matrix to correct for population structure and relatedness or structured association with further correction using genomic control indicated significant associations between LpFT3 and variation in flowering time. These associations were corroborated in a validation population segregating for the same major alleles. The most "diagnostic" region of genomic variation was situated 5' of the coding sequence. Analysis of this region identified that the interhaplotype variation was closely associated with sequence motifs that were apparently conserved in the 5' region of orthologs of LpFT3 from other plant species. These may represent cis-regulatory elements involved in influencing the expression of this gene.
21265893	Lr34 multi-pathogen resistance ABC transporter: molecular analysis of homoeologous and orthologous genes in hexaploid wheat and other grass species.	2011	Plant J	The Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) disease resistance gene Lr34 confers durable, race non-specific protection against three fungal pathogens, and has been a highly relevant gene for wheat breeding since the green revolution. Lr34, located on chromosome 7D, encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Both wheat cultivars with and without Lr34-based resistance encode a putatively functional protein that differ by only two amino acid polymorphisms. In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in hexaploid wheat and other grasses. In hexaploid wheat we found an expressed and putatively functional Lr34 homoeolog located on chromosome 4A, designated Lr34-B. Another homoeologous Lr34 copy, located on chromosome 7A, was disrupted by the insertion of repetitive elements. Protein sequences of LR34-B and LR34 were 97% identical. Orthologous Lr34 genes were detected in the genomes of Oryza sativa (rice) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum). Zea mays (maize), Brachypodium distachyon and Hordeum vulgare (barley) lacked Lr34 orthologs, indicating independent deletion of this particular ABC transporter. Lr34 was part of a gene-rich island on the wheat D genome. We found gene colinearity on the homoeologous A and B genomes of hexaploid wheat, but little microcolinearity in other grasses. The homoeologous LR34-B protein and the orthologs from rice and sorghum have the susceptible haplotype for the two critical polymorphisms distinguishing the LR34 proteins from susceptible and resistant wheat cultivars. We conclude that the particular Lr34-haplotype found in resistant wheat cultivars is unique. It probably resulted from functional gene diversification that occurred after the polyploidization event that was at the origin of cultivated bread wheat.
21288266	Uncoupling phosphate deficiency from its major effects on growth and transcriptome via PHO1 expression in Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant J	Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth in both natural and agricultural contexts. Pi-deficiency leads to a strong decrease in shoot growth, and triggers extensive changes at the developmental, biochemical and gene expression levels that are presumably aimed at improving the acquisition of this nutrient and sustaining growth. The Arabidopsis thaliana PHO1 gene has previously been shown to participate in the transport of Pi from roots to shoots, and the null pho1 mutant has all the hallmarks associated with shoot Pi deficiency. We show here that A. thaliana plants with a reduced expression of PHO1 in roots have shoot growth similar to Pi-sufficient plants, despite leaves being strongly Pi deficient. Furthermore, the gene expression profile normally triggered by Pi deficiency is suppressed in plants with low PHO1 expression. At comparable levels of shoot Pi supply, the wild type reduces shoot growth but maintains adequate shoot vacuolar Pi content, whereas the PHO1 underexpressor maintains maximal growth with strongly depleted Pi reserves. Expression of the Oryza sativa (rice) PHO1 ortholog in the pho1 null mutant also leads to plants that maintain normal growth and suppression of the Pi-deficiency response, despite the low shoot Pi. These data show that it is possible to unlink low shoot Pi content with the responses normally associated with Pi deficiency through the modulation of PHO1 expression or activity. These data also show that reduced shoot growth is not a direct consequence of Pi deficiency, but is more likely to be a result of extensive gene expression reprogramming triggered by Pi deficiency.
20960223	Origins of functional nucleotide polymorphisms in a major quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	qLTG3-1 is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling tolerance to low-temperature at the seed germination stage (termed low-temperature germinability) in rice using a population derived from the cross between Italica Livorno from Italy and Hayamasari from Japan. Map-based cloning identified that qLTG3-1 encodes a protein of unknown function. The molecular identification of this major QTL could make it possible to identify allelic variation and favorable alleles for rice breeding programs. The present study examined the identification of qLTG3-1 alleles and their distribution among 62 landraces of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) collected from 19 different countries, termed the rice core collection. In the coding region, a single non-synonymous substitution and 3 in-frame insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) were detected. The almost completely conserved protein alignment of qLTG3-1 was also identified among 5 Oryza species, suggesting that the function of qLTG3-1 is critical for seed germination or for rice growth by pleiotropic effects of the gene. The functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs), a 71-bp deletion found in Hayamasari and an amino acid substitution found in Nipponbare, was identified in varieties from Japan. These alleles with FNPs might be adapted to rice cultivation in specific local conditions. The present results may contribute to the utilization of favorable alleles of qLTG3-1 for the improvement of low-temperature germinability in rice breeding programs.
21175891	Temporal and spatial regulation of DROOPING LEAF gene expression that promotes midrib formation in rice.	2011	Plant J	Genes involved in the differentiation and development of tissues and organs are temporally and spatially regulated in plant development. The DROOPING LEAF (DL) gene, a member of the YABBY gene family, promotes midrib formation in the leaf and carpel specification in the flower. Consistent with these functions, DL is initially expressed in the central region of the leaf primordia (presumptive midrib) and in the presumptive carpel primordia in the meristem. To understand the regulatory mechanism underlying DL expression, we tried to identify cis-regulatory regions required for temporal and spatial expression of this gene. We found that the cis region responsible for the presumptive midrib-specific expression in the leaf primordia is located in intron 2. Next, we confined the region to a sequence of about 200bp, which corresponds to a conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) identified by phylogenetic footprinting. In addition, a sequence termed DG1, incorporating a 5' upstream region of about 7.4kb, and introns 1 and 2, was shown to be sufficient to induce DL in the presumptive midrib, and to suppress it in other regions in the leaf primordia. By contrast, the regulatory region required for carpel-specific expression was not included in the DG1 sequence. We modified Oryza sativa (rice) plant architecture by expressing an activated version of DL (DL-VP16) in a precise manner using the DG1 sequence: the resulting transgenic plant produced a midrib in the distal region of the leaf blade, where there is no midrib in wild type, and formed more upright leaves compared with the wild type.
21136139	Functional characterisation of OsCPK21, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that confers salt tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Calcium acts as a messenger in various signal transduction pathways in plants. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles in regulating downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. In rice, the CDPKs constitute a large multigene family consisting of 29 genes, but the biological functions and functional divergence or redundancy of most of these genes remain unclear. Using a mini-scale full-length cDNA overexpressor (FOX) gene hunting system, we generated 250 independent transgenic rice plants overexpressing individual rice CDPKs (CDPK FOX-rice lines). These CDPK FOX-rice lines were screened for salt stress tolerance. The survival rate of the OsCPK21-FOX plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants grown under high salinity conditions. The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants. Several ABA- and high salinity-inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants. These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress.
21055780	Phosphorylation-mediated regulation of a rice ABA responsive element binding factor.	2011	Phytochemistry	OREB1 is a rice ABRE binding factor characterized by the presence of multiple highly-conserved phosphorylation domains (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and two kinase recognition motifs, RXXS/T and S/TXXE/D, within different functional domains. An in vitro kinase assay showed that OREB1 is phosphorylated not only by the SnRK2 kinase, but also by other Ser/Thr protein kinases, such as CaMKII, CKII, and SnRK3. Furthermore, the N-terminal phosphorylation domain C1 was found to be differentially phosphorylated by the SnRK2/SnRK3 kinase and by hyperosmotic/cold stress, suggesting that the C1 domain may function in decoding different signals. The phosphorylation-mediated regulation of OREB1 activity was investigated through mutation of the SnRK2 recognition motif RXXS/T within each phosphorylation module. OREB1 contains a crucial nine-amino acid transactivation domain located near the phosphorylation module C1. Deletion of the C1 domain increased OREB1 activity, whereas mutation of Ser 44, Ser 45, and Ser 48 of the C1 domain to aspartates decreased OREB1 activity. In the C2 domain, a double mutation of Ser 118 and Ser 120 to alanines suppressed OREB1 activity. These findings strongly suggest that selective phosphorylation of the C1 or C2 modules may positively or negatively regulate OREB1 transactivation. In addition, mutation of Ser 385 of the C4 domain to alanines completely abolished the interaction between OREB1 and a rice 14-3-3 protein, GF14d, suggesting that SnRK2-mediated phosphorylation may regulate this interaction. These results indicate that phosphorylation domains of OREB1 are not functionally redundant and regulate at least three different functions, including transactivation activity, DNA binding, and protein interactions. The multisite phosphorylation of OREB1 is likely a key for the fine control of its activity and signal integration in the complex stress signaling network of plant cells.
21112065	Probing the role of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolism in defense responses against Bipolaris oryzae infection in rice leaves by a suicide substrate of tryptophan decarboxylase.	2011	Phytochemistry	Tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites, including serotonin and its hydroxycinnamic acid amides, markedly accumulate in rice leaves in response to pathogen attack. These compounds have been implicated in the physical defense system against pathogen invasion by being deposited in cell walls. Serotonin is biosynthesized from tryptophan via tryptamine, and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) catalyzes the first committed reaction. In this study, (S)-α-(fluoromethyl)tryptophan (S-αFMT) was utilized to investigate the effects of the inhibition of TDC on the defense responses of rice leaves. S-αFMT, enantiospecifically synthesized from L-tryptophan, effectively inhibited TDC activity extracted from rice leaves infected by Bipolaris oryzae. The inhibition rate increased dependently on the incubation time, indicating that S-αFMT served as a suicide substrate. Treatment of rice seedlings with S-αFMT suppressed accumulation of serotonin, tryptamine, and hydroxycinnamic acid amides of serotonin in a dose-dependent manner in B. oryzae-inoculated leaves. The lesions formed on seedlings treated with S-αFMT lacked deposition of brown materials, and those leaves were severely damaged in comparison with leaves without S-αFMT treatment. Administrating tryptamine to S-αFMT-treated leaves restored accumulation of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites as well as deposition of brown material. In addition, tryptamine administration reduced damage caused by fungal infection. Accordingly, the accumulation of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites was suggested to be part of the effective defense mechanism of rice.
21075959	Cyanide, a coproduct of plant hormone ethylene biosynthesis, contributes to the resistance of rice to blast fungus.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) plants carrying the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae restrict invaded fungus in infected tissue via hypersensitive reaction or response (HR), which is accompanied by rapid ethylene production and formation of small HR lesions. Ethylene biosynthesis has been implicated to be important for blast resistance; however, the individual roles of ethylene and cyanide, which are produced from the precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, remain unevaluated. In this study, we found that Pi-i-mediated resistance was compromised in transgenic rice lines, in which ethylene biosynthetic enzyme genes were silenced and then ethylene production was inhibited. The compromised resistance in transgenic lines was recovered by exogenously applying cyanide but not ethephon, an ethylene-releasing chemical in plant tissue. In a susceptible rice cultivar, treatment with cyanide or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid induced the resistance to blast fungus in a dose-dependent manner, while ethephon did not have the effect. Cyanide inhibited the growth of blast fungus in vitro and in planta, and application of flavonoids, secondary metabolites that exist ubiquitously in the plant kingdom, enhanced the cyanide-induced inhibition of fungal growth. These results suggested that cyanide, whose production is triggered by HR in infected tissue, contributes to the resistance in rice plants via restriction of fungal growth.
21175892	CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.	2011	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces momilactone diterpenoids as both phytoalexins and allelochemicals. Strikingly, the rice genome contains a biosynthetic gene cluster for momilactone production, located on rice chromosome 4, which contains two cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock-down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation. Here we attempted biochemical characterization of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, which was ultimately achieved by complete gene recoding, enabling functional recombinant expression in bacteria. With these synthetic gene constructs it was possible to demonstrate that while CYP99A2 does not exhibit significant activity with diterpene substrates, CYP99A3 catalyzes consecutive oxidations of the C19 methyl group of the momilactone precursor syn-pimara-7,15-diene to form, sequentially, syn-pimaradien-19-ol, syn-pimaradien-19-al, and syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid. These are presumably intermediates in momilactone biosynthesis, as a C19 carboxylic acid moiety is required for formation of the core 19,6-γ-lactone ring structure. We further were able to detect syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid in rice plants, which indicates physiological relevance for the observed activity of CYP99A3. In addition, we found that CYP99A3 also oxidized syn-stemod-13(17)-ene at C19 to produce, sequentially, syn-stemoden-19-ol, syn-stemoden-19-al, and syn-stemoden-19-oic acid, albeit with lower catalytic efficiency than with syn-pimaradiene. Although the CYP99A3 syn-stemodene-derived products were not detected in planta, these results nevertheless provide a hint at the currently unknown metabolic fate of this diterpene in rice. Regardless of any wider role, our results strongly indicate that CYP99A3 acts as a multifunctional diterpene oxidase in momilactone biosynthesis.
21071600	Manipulating broad-spectrum disease resistance by suppressing pathogen-induced auxin accumulation in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Breeding crops with the quality of broad-spectrum disease resistance using genetic resources is one of the principal goals of crop improvement. However, the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance remains largely unknown. Here, we show that GH3-2, encoding an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, mediates a broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola and fungal Magnaporthe grisea in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA, the major form of auxin in rice, results in rice more vulnerable to the invasion of different types of pathogens, which is at least partly due to IAA-induced loosening of the cell wall, the natural protective barrier of plant cells to invaders. X. oryzae pv oryzae, X. oryzae pv oryzicola, and M. grisea secrete IAA, which, in turn, may induce rice to synthesize its own IAA at the infection site. IAA induces the production of expansins, the cell wall-loosening proteins, and makes rice vulnerable to pathogens. GH3-2 is likely contributing to a minor quantitative trait locus for broad-spectrum resistance. Activation of GH3-2 inactivates IAA by catalyzing the formation of an IAA-amino acid conjugate, which results in the suppression of expansin genes. Thus, GH3-2 mediates basal resistance by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation. It is expected that, regulated by a pathogen-induced strong promoter, GH3-2 alone may be used for breeding rice with a broad-spectrum disease resistance.
21161331	ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	"zebra" mutants have alternating green and chlorotic crossbands on leaf blades and are widely distributed in monocotyledonous crops. Most recently, we cloned the first responsible gene from rice, ZEBRA2, which also leads to the phenotype of rice preharvest sprouting. ZEBRA2, a single-copy gene in the rice genome, encodes a carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cis-lycopene to all-trans lycopene. ZEBRA2 shares high identity with known CRTISOs from other species. Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs. Consistent with the alteration in agronomic traits, the zebra2 mutant exhibits decreased photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. Mutation of the ZEBRA2 gene results in the accumulation of all-trans-lycopene precursor, prolycopene (7Z,9Z,7'Z,9'Z tetra cis-lycopene), in dark-grown zebra2 tissues. Light-grown zebra2 mutant exhibits the characteristic "zebra" phenotype and decreased level of lutein, the xanthophyll that is essential for efficient chl triplet quenching. More severe phenotype of the zebra2 mutant under high light intensity indicates that "zebra" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages. We conclude that ZEBRA2 is involved in photoprotection in rice.
21223385	OsPUB15, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions to reduce cellular oxidative stress during seedling establishment.	2011	Plant J	The plant U-box (PUB) protein functions as an E3 ligase to poly-ubiquitinate a target protein for its degradation or post-translational modification. Here, we report functional roles for OsPUB15, which encodes a cytosolic U-box protein in the class-II PUB family. Self-ubiquitination assays showed that bacterially expressed MBP-OsPUB15 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. A T-DNA insertional mutation in OsPUB15 caused severe growth retardation and a seedling-lethal phenotype. Mutant seeds did not produce primary roots, and their shoot development was significantly delayed. Transgenic plants expressing the OsPUB15 antisense transcript phenocopied these mutant characters. The abnormal phenotypes were partially rescued by two antioxidants, catechin and ascorbic acid. Germinating seeds in the dark also recovered the rootless defect. Levels of H2O2 and oxidized proteins were higher in the knock-out mutant compared with the wild type. OsPUB15 transcript levels were increased upon H2O2, salt and drought stresses; plants overexpressing the gene grew better than the wild type under high salinity. These results indicate that PUB15 is a regulator that reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress and cell death.
20580815	Chromosomal conservation and sequence diversity of ribosomal RNA genes of two distant Oryza species.	2010	Genomics	Contrary to the chromosomal polymorphism of 45S ribosomal genes (45S rDNA) loci in other Oryza species, each of Oryza australiensis and Oryza brachyantha has only one 45S rDNA locus at the most conserved position of 45S rDNAs in Oryza. O. australiensis and O. brachyantha are known phylogenetically distant and have extremely different genome sizes among diploid Oryza species. This study reveals that the sequences and organizations of intergenic spacer (IGS) for 45S rDNA of both O. australiensis and O. brachyantha are different from other Oryza species. The IGS of O. australiensis contains 13 tandem repeats and only one transcriptional initiation site, while there are four tandem repeats and three transcriptional initiation sites in the IGS of O. brachyantha. Our results suggest different evolution processes of orthologous rDNA loci in the genus Oryza. Here we also demonstrate an efficient strategy to study locus-specific IGS before whole genome sequences data are available.
20202129	Expression analysis and functional characterization of the monosaccharide transporters, OsTMTs, involving vacuolar sugar transport in rice (Oryza sativa).	2010	New Phytol	In Arabidopsis, the compartmentation of sugars into vacuoles is known to be facilitated by sugar transporters. However, vacuolar sugar transporters have not been studied in detail in other plant species. To characterize the rice (Oryza sativa) tonoplast monosaccharide transporters, OsTMT1 and OsTMT2, we analysed their subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expression patterns using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assay and in situ hybridization analysis, and assessed sugar transport ability using isolated vacuoles. Expression of OsTMT-GFP fusion protein in rice and Arabidopsis revealed that the OsTMTs localize at the tonoplast. Analyses of OsTMT promoter-GUS transgenic rice indicated that OsTMT1 and OsTMT2 are highly expressed in bundle sheath cells, and in vascular parenchyma and companion cells in leaves, respectively. Both genes were found to be preferentially expressed in the vascular tissues of roots, the palea/lemma of spikelets, and in the main vascular tissues and nucellar projections on the dorsal side of the seed coats. Glucose uptake studies using vacuoles isolated from transgenic mutant Arabidopsis (tmt1-2-3) expressing OsTMT1 demonstrated that OsTMTs are capable of transporting glucose into vacuoles. Based on expression analysis and functional characterization, our present findings suggest that the OsTMTs play a role in vacuolar glucose storage in rice.
20229250	Genomic structure and evolution of the Pi2/9 locus in wild rice species.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a devastating disease of rice worldwide. Among the 85 mapped resistance (R) genes against blast, 13 have been cloned and characterized. However, how these genes originated and how they evolved in the Oryza genus remains unclear. We previously cloned the rice blast R-genes Pi2, Pi9, and Piz-t, and analyzed their genomic structure and evolution in cultivated rice. In this study, we determined the genomic sequences of the Pi2/9 locus in four wild Oryza species representing three genomes (AA, BB and CC). The number of Pi2/9 family members in the four wild species ranges from two copies to 12 copies. Although these genes are conserved in structure and categorized into the same subfamily, sequence duplications and subsequent inversions or uneven crossing overs were observed, suggesting that the locus in different wild species has undergone dynamic changes. Positive selection was found in the leucine-rich repeat region of most members, especially in the largest clade where Pi9 is included. We also provide evidence that the Pi9 gene is more related to its homologues in the recurrent line and other rice cultivars than to those in its alleged donor species O. minuta, indicating a possible origin of the Pi9 gene from O. sativa. Comparative sequence analysis between the four wild Oryza species and the previously established reference sequences in cultivated rice species at the Pi2/9 locus has provided extensive and unique information on the genomic structure and evolution of a complex R-gene cluster in the Oryza genus.
19932463	Analysis of collinear regions of Oryza AA and CC genomes.	2009	J Genet Genomics	Comparative analyses of genome structure and sequence of closely related species have yielded insights into the evolution and function of plant genomes. A total of 103,844 BAC end sequences delegated approximately 73.8 Mb of O. officinalis that belongs to the CC genome type of the rice genus Oryza were obtained and compared with the genome sequences of rice cultivar, O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. We found that more than 45% of O. officinalis genome consists of repeat sequences, which is higher than that of Nipponbare cultivar. To further investigate the evolutionary divergence of AA and CC genomes, two BAC-contigs of O. officinalis were compared with the collinear genomic regions of Nipponbare. Of 57 genes predicted in the AA genome orthologous regions, 39 had orthologs in the regions of the CC genome. Alignment of the orthologous regions indicated that the CC genome has undergone expansion in both genic and intergenic regions through primarily retroelement insertion. Particularly, the density of RNA transposable elements was 17.95% and 1.78% in O. officinalis and O. sativa, respectively. This explains why the orthologous region is about 100 kb longer in the CC genome in comparison to the AA genome.
20963607	Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes.	2011	Planta	We previously cloned a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene (OsNHX1) from rice (Oryza sativa). Here we identified four additional NHX-type antiporter genes in rice (OsNHX2 through OsNHX5) and performed molecular and functional analyses of those genes. The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5). OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration. The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA. When we studied the expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters. In addition, each promoter had a unique expression pattern. OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains. Our results suggest that the members of this gene family play important roles in the compartmentalization into vacuoles of the Na+ and K+ that accumulate in the cytoplasm and that the differential regulation of antiporter gene expression in different rice tissues may be an important factor determining salt tolerance in rice.
15032821	Cloning and characterization of the gene for a phloem-specific glutathione S-transferase from rice leaves.	2004	Physiol Plant	The N-terminal amino-acid sequence was determined for a major rice phloem protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa, named RPP31. The corresponding full-length rice EST-clone was cloned based on the amino acid sequence. The predicted total amino-acid sequence of RPP31 shared high similarity with plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Recombinant RPP31 produced in Escherichia coli and rice phloem sap showed GST activity. Immunocytological analysis indicated that RPP31 is localized in the phloem region of leaves. In mature leaves, the signal was restricted to sieve element-companion cell complexes, and was stronger in sieve elements than in companion cells. Although some plant GSTs are known to be induced by xenobiotics, the amount of RPP31 was not affected by treatments with an herbicide, pretilachlor, and/or its safener, fenclorim. These results suggest that RPP31 is an active GST restricted to the phloem region of normal rice leaves.
21249365	Genetic and molecular analysis of a purple sheath somaclonal mutant in japonica rice.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Natural and artificially induced mutants have provided valuable resources for plant genetic studies and crop improvement. In this study, we investigated the genetic and molecular basis of the purple sheath trait in a somaclonal mutant Z418, which was regenerated from a green sheath rice variety C418 through tissue culture. The purple sheath trait in Z418 was heritable and stable based on our 10 years of evaluation. Genetic analysis revealed that the purple sheath trait of the mutant was controlled by a single dominant gene. To map the gene, we scored 89 polymorphic SSRs markers in a F(2) population of 232 plants derived from a cross between Z418 and HX-3, an indica variety with green sheath trait. The gene was initially mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6 between two SSR markers, RPM5 and RM402, with a genetic distance of 1.1 and 10.3 cM, respectively. Thirty-one SSR and indel markers located within the target region were further used to fine-map the gene to a 153-kb interval between two SSR markers (RPM8 and RPM11). The OsC1 gene, which locates within the region and encodes a MYB family transcription factor, was chosen as the candidate gene controlling the purple sheath trait in Z418. Sequencing analysis revealed that OsC1 gene and its transcript in Z418 was 34 bp longer than that in C418. The possible mechanisms for the gene mutation, the developmental and tissue-specific expression of purple anthocyanin pigmentation in Z418, were finally discussed.
8811865	rbohA, a rice homologue of the mammalian gp91phox respiratory burst oxidase gene.	1996	Plant J	It has been hypothesized that plants contain respiratory burst oxidase which, upon activation, oxidize NADPH and generate extracellular superoxide, O2.-. These proteins are proposed to play a central role in defence against pathogens. However, plant DNA sequences that encode proteins with similarity to components of respiratory burst oxidase have not previously been reported. This paper describes the complete cDNA and genomic DNA sequence of the rice rbohA (for respiratory burst oxidase homologue) gene. The predicted RbohA product is most similar to the main catalytic subunit, gp91phox, of the respiratory burst oxidase of neutrophils. Reverse transcriptase PCR detects rbohA transcripts in both roots and shoots of healthy rice plants.
20584133	Seeing red: the origin of grain pigmentation in US weedy rice.	2010	Mol Ecol	Weedy forms of crop species infest agricultural fields worldwide and are a leading cause of crop losses, yet little is known about how these weeds evolve. Red rice (Oryza sativa), a major weed of cultivated rice fields in the US, is recognized by the dark-pigmented grain that gives it its common name. Studies using neutral molecular markers have indicated a close relationship between US red rice and domesticated rice, suggesting that the weed may have originated through reversion of domesticated rice to a feral form. We have tested this reversion hypothesis by examining molecular variation at Rc, the regulatory gene responsible for grain pigmentation differences between domesticated and wild rice. Loss-of-function mutations at Rc account for the absence of proanthocyanidin pigments in cultivated rice grains, and the major rc domestication allele has been shown to be capable of spontaneous reversion to a functional form through additional mutations at the Rc locus. Using a diverse sample of 156 weedy, domesticated and wild Oryzas, we analysed DNA sequence variation at Rc and its surrounding 4 Mb genomic region. We find that reversion of domestication alleles does not account for the pigmented grains of weed accessions; moreover, we find that haplotypes characterizing the weed are either absent or very rare in cultivated rice. Sequences from genomic regions flanking Rc are consistent with a genomic footprint of the rc selective sweep in cultivated rice, and they are compatible with a close relationship of red rice to Asian Oryzas that have never been cultivated in the US.
21121088	The molecular basis of white pericarps in African domesticated rice: novel mutations at the Rc gene.	2010	J Evol Biol	Repeated phenotypic evolution can occur at both the inter- and intraspecific level and is especially prominent in domesticated plants, where artificial selection has favoured the same traits in many different species and varieties. The question of whether repeated evolution reflects changes at the same or different genes in each lineage can now be addressed using the domestication and improvement genes that have been identified in a variety of crops. Here, we document the genetic basis of nonpigmented ('white') pericarps in domesticated African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and compare it with the known genetic basis of the same trait in domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). In some cases, white pericarps in African rice are apparently caused by unique mutations at the Rc gene, which also controls pericarp colour variation in Asian rice. In one case, white pericarps appear to reflect changes at a different gene or potentially a cis-regulatory region.
20227044	ELE restrains empty glumes from developing into lemmas.	2010	J Genet Genomics	Although there is evident homology among reproductive organs when comparing Poaceae (grass) and eudicots, the identity of grass specific organs, such as lodicules, palea, lemma, and glumes has been the subject of a vast and largely inconclusive discussion. Here we provide some direct evidence to support the idea that the empty glumes of rice (Oryza sativa) are counterparts of lemmas. We show that the development of empty glumes is regulated by ELE (elongated empty glume), which belongs to a plant specific novel gene family. Mutations at the ELE locus cause elongated empty glumes, which mimic the lemmas and have the epidermal morphology of lemmas with four or five vascular bundles. As a nuclear-localized gene, ELE is specifically expressed at the empty glumes of immature spikelets, and its ectopic expression causes many floral development defects, including lemma-like palea, extra palea-like structures, elongated lodicules, extra stamens and stigmas. Our result suggests that empty glumes are lemmas of the sterile florets located at the lateral side of the rice spikelet, and ELE acts as a regulator restraining its growth to maintain its small size in wild-type plants.
21035096	Expression of CENH3 alleles in synthesized allopolyploid Oryza species.	2010	J Genet Genomics	Synthesized allopolyploids are valuable materials for comparative analyses of two or more distinct genomes, such as the expression changes (activation, inactivation or differential expression) of orthologous genes following allopolyploidization. CENH3 is a centromere- specific histone H3 variant and has been regarded as a central component in kinetochore formation and centromere function. In this study, interspecific hybrids of Oryza genus (AA × CC, AA × CCDD) and their backcross progenies were produced, and the genome constitutions were identified as AC, ACC, ACD, AACD, or AA(CD) by Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). We further cloned and sequenced the CENH3 genes from O. sativa (AA), O. officinalis (CC) and O. latifolia (CCDD). Sequencing of RT-PCR products revealed that CENH3_C2 and CENH3_D, the two CENH3 alleles from O. latifolia, showed polymorphism in several sites, while CENH3_C2 and CENH3_C1 from O. officinalis were different at only two amino acids positions. Moreover, we found that the CENH3 genes from both parents are expressed in interspecific hybrids and their progenies. Specifically, based on our cDNA sequencing data, the ratio of expression level between CENH3_A and CENH3_C1 was approximately 1 in AC and 0.5 in ACC genomes, respectively. As a result, the CENH3 expression patterns shed more light on the inter-coordination between varied centromeric DNA sequences and highly conserved kinetochore protein in synthesized allopolyploids of Oryza genus.
20495565	Regulation of OsSPL14 by OsmiR156 defines ideal plant architecture in rice.	2010	Nat Genet	Increasing crop yield is a major challenge for modern agriculture. The development of new plant types, which is known as ideal plant architecture (IPA), has been proposed as a means to enhance rice yield potential over that of existing high-yield varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a semidominant quantitative trait locus, IPA1 (Ideal Plant Architecture 1), which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and substantially enhances rice grain yield. The IPA1 quantitative trait locus encodes OsSPL14 (SOUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14) and is regulated by microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR156 in vivo. We demonstrate that a point mutation in OsSPL14 perturbs OsmiR156-directed regulation of OsSPL14, generating an 'ideal' rice plant with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield. Our study suggests that OsSPL14 may help improve rice grain yield by facilitating the breeding of new elite rice varieties.
23572921	Isolation and Expression analysis of OsPME1, encoding for a putative Pectin Methyl Esterase from Oryza sativa (subsp. indica).	2009	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Pectin Methyl Esterases (PMEs) play an essential role during plant development by affecting the mechanical properties of the plant cell walls. Recent studies indicated that PMEs play important role in pollen tube development. In this study, we isolated a 1.3 kb cDNA clone from rice panicle cDNA library. It contained a 1038 bp of open reading frame (ORF) encoding for a putative pectin methyl esterase of 345 aminoacids with a 20 aminoacid signal peptide and was hence designated as OsPME1 (Oryza sativaPectin Methyl Esterase 1). It contained the structural arrangement GXYXE and GXXDFIF, found in the active groups of all PMEs. OsPME1 gene product shared varying identities, ranging from 52 % to 33 % with PMEs from other plant species belonging to Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Amaranthaceae and Funariaceae. Southern blot analysis indicated that PME1 exists as a single copy in the rice genome. Expression pattern analysis revealed that OsPME1 is expressed only in pollen grains, during the later stages of their development and was also regulated by various abiotic stress treatments and phytohormones. Functional characterization of this pollen specific PME from rice would enable us to understand its role in pollen development.
18818927	Molecular analyses of the rice tubby-like protein gene family and their response to bacterial infection.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Tubby-like protein family has been identified in various multicellular organisms, indicating its fundamental functions in the organisms. However, the roles of plant tubby-like proteins are unknown. In this study, we have defined the tubby-like protein gene (OsTLP) family with 14 members in rice. Most of the OsTLPs harbor a tubby domain in their carboxyl terminus and an F-box domain in the amino terminus. The expression of all the OsTLPs was induced on infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The maximal expression levels were observed at 2-8 h after infection for all the genes. Eight of the 14 OsTLPs were also responsive to wounding. All the OsTLPs showed differential expression in different tissues at different developmental stages. However, four pairs of the 14 OsTLPs, with each pair having high sequence similarity and distributing on the similar position of different chromosomes, showed similar expression pattern in different tissues, indicating their direct relationship in evolution. These results suggest that the OsTLP family is involved in host-pathogen interaction and it may be also associated with other physiological and developmental activities.
20450965	Genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships in genus Oryza revealed by using highly variable regions of chloroplast DNA.	2010	Gene	We studied the phylogeny of the genus Oryza using chloroplast DNA sequences. To identify regions containing sufficient variation for elucidating the relationship of closely related species with fine resolution and high reliability, we first compared the complete chloroplast sequences of Oryza sativa japonica, O. sativa indica, and O. nivara, and identified regions containing many variant sites. Nucleotide sequences of the variant regions were newly determined in 19 Oryza species including 58 cultivated and wild strains. An in silico pre-analysis of the whole chloroplast genome and subsequent nucleotide sequencing of the regions with the greatest number of variant sites, which were disclosed to be hot spots by the in silico pre-analysis, enabled us to examine genetic diversity in the genus Oryza with excellent resolution. Based on phylogenetic trees constructed using highly diverged regions in the chloroplast genome, we discuss the maternal relationships among Oryza species.
20202171	ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development.	2010	Plant J	The zebra-necrosis (zn) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) produces transversely green/yellow-striped leaves. The mutant phenotype is formed by unequal impairment of chloroplast biogenesis before emergence from the leaf sheath under alternate light/dark or high/low temperatures (restrictive), but not under constant light and temperature (permissive) conditions. Map-based cloning revealed that ZN encodes a thylakoid-bound protein of unknown function. Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development. Necrotic lesions often occur in the yellow sectors as a result of an excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phenotypic severity (leaf variegation and necrosis) and ROS levels are positively correlated with an increase in light intensity under restrictive conditions. In the mutant leaves, chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism, ROS scavenging activities, maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), and structures and functions of the photosynthetic complexes are normal in the Chl-containing cells, suggesting that ROS are mainly generated from the defective plastids of the Chl-free cells. The PSII activity of normal chloroplasts is hypersensitive to photoinhibition because the recovery rates of PSII are much slower. In the PSII repair, the degradation of damaged D1 is not impaired, suggesting a reduced activity of new D1 synthesis, possibly because of higher levels of ROS generated from the Chl-free cells by excess light. Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness.
17891605	Identification of six new box C/D snoRNA gene clusters from rice.	2007	IUBMB Life	Here we have identified 18 different box C/D snoRNAs encoded in six new gene clusters by the screening of Oryza sativa (rice) genome sequences using a computer program that we have designed to search for non-canonical box C and D sequences. Among this snoRNA collection, five are homologues of snoRNAs previously reported in other plants. One snoRNA is implicated to guide methylation at a corresponding site also modified in yeast rRNA but not in any other plants species yet examined. The other 12 snoRNAs are implicated in guiding 12 completely novel rRNA 2'-O-ribose methylation sites. We have verified the methylation of these rRNA sites by dNTP-concentration dependent primer extension assay. The expression of all snoRNAs reported here was experimentally confirmed by primer extension assay. Polycistronic precursor transcripts from the gene clusters have been demonstrated by RT-PCR. Thus it is highly likely that each of the rice snoRNA gene clusters identified here is transcribed in a polycistronic way, regardless of whether or not they are encoded within introns. This indicates that the mode of polycistronic expression of snoRNA clusters is widespread in rice, as is the case in Arabidopsis thaliana.
20713469	Contrasting evolutionary patterns of the Rp1 resistance gene family in different species of Poaceae.	2011	Mol Biol Evol	Disease-resistance genes (R-genes) in plants show complex evolutionary patterns. We investigated the evolution of the Rp1 R-gene family in Poaceae, and 409 Rp1 fragments were sequenced from 21 species. Our data showed that the common ancestor of Poaceae had two Rp1 loci, but the number of Rp1 locus in extant species varies from one to five. Some wheat and Zea genotypes have dozens of Rp1 homologues in striking contrast to one or two copies in Brachypodium distachyon. The large number of diverse Rp1 homologues in Zea was the result of duplications followed by extensive sequence exchanges among paralogues, and all genes in maize have evolved in a pattern of Type I R-genes. The high frequency of sequence exchanges did not cause concerted evolution in Zea species, but concerted evolution was obvious between Rp1 homologues from genera Zea and Sorghum. Differentiation of Type I and Type II Rp1 homologues was observed in Oryza species, likely occurred in their common ancestor. One member (Type II R-gene) in the Oryza Rp1 cluster did not change sequences with its paralogues, whereas the other paralogues (Type I R-genes) had frequent sequence exchanges. The functional Pi37 resistance gene in rice was generated through an unequal crossover between two neighboring paralogues followed by four point mutations. The Rp1 homologues in wheat and barley were most divergent, probably due to lack of sequence exchanges among them. Our results shed more light on R-gene evolution, particularly on the differentiation of Type I and Type II R-genes.
20182746	RNase T2 genes from rice and the evolution of secretory ribonucleases in plants.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	The plant RNase T2 family is divided into two different subfamilies. S-RNases are involved in rejection of self-pollen during the establishment of self-incompatibility in three plant families. S-like RNases, on the other hand, are not involved in self-incompatibility, and although gene expression studies point to a role in plant defense and phosphate recycling, their biological roles are less well understood. Although S-RNases have been subjects of many phylogenetic studies, few have included an extensive analysis of S-like RNases, and genome-wide analyses to determine the number of S-like RNases in fully sequenced plant genomes are missing. We characterized the eight RNase T2 genes present in the Oryza sativa genome; and we also identified the full complement of RNase T2 genes present in other fully sequenced plant genomes. Phylogenetics and gene expression analyses identified two classes among the S-like RNase subfamily. Class I genes show tissue specificity and stress regulation. Inactivation of RNase activity has occurred repeatedly throughout evolution. On the other hand, Class II seems to have conserved more ancestral characteristics; and, unlike other S-like RNases, genes in this class are conserved in all plant species analyzed and most are constitutively expressed. Our results suggest that gene duplication resulted in high diversification of Class I genes. Many of these genes are differentially expressed in response to stress, and we propose that protein characteristics, such as the increase in basic residues can have a defense role independent of RNase activity. On the other hand, constitutive expression and phylogenetic conservation suggest that Class II S-like RNases may have a housekeeping role.
21253568	A novel RNA-recognition-motif protein is required for premeiotic G1/S-phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	PLoS Genet	The molecular mechanism for meiotic entry remains largely elusive in flowering plants. Only Arabidopsis SWI1/DYAD and maize AM1, both of which are the coiled-coil protein, are known to be required for the initiation of plant meiosis. The mechanism underlying the synchrony of male meiosis, characteristic to flowering plants, has also been unclear in the plant kingdom. In other eukaryotes, RNA-recognition-motif (RRM) proteins are known to play essential roles in germ-cell development and meiosis progression. Rice MEL2 protein discovered in this study shows partial similarity with human proline-rich RRM protein, deleted in Azoospermia-Associated Protein1 (DAZAP1), though MEL2 also possesses ankyrin repeats and a RING finger motif. Expression analyses of several cell-cycle markers revealed that, in mel2 mutant anthers, most germ cells failed to enter premeiotic S-phase and meiosis, and a part escaped from the defect and underwent meiosis with a significant delay or continued mitotic cycles. Immunofluorescent detection revealed that T7 peptide-tagged MEL2 localized at cytoplasmic perinuclear region of germ cells during premeiotic interphase in transgenic rice plants. This study is the first report of the plant RRM protein, which is required for regulating the premeiotic G1/S-phase transition of male and female germ cells and also establishing synchrony of male meiosis. This study will contribute to elucidation of similarities and diversities in reproduction system between plants and other species.
20195612	Fertility restoration by Ifr1 in rice with BT-type cytoplasmic male sterility is associated with a reduced level, but not processing, of atp6-orf79 co-transcribed RNA.	2010	Plant Cell Rep	BT-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in rice is associated with accumulation of unprocessed dicistronic RNA containing a duplicated atp6 (B-atp6) and an unusual open reading frame, orf79, encoding a cytotoxic peptide in mitochondria. The male-sterile state of BT-type CMS is stably maintained by backcrossing the plants with line Taichung 65 (T65) that has no restorer gene and is completely suppressed by the presence of the Rf1 gene through the processing of B-atp6-orf79 RNA. A variant of the T65 line, T65(T), has a weak restoration function conferred by the Ifr1 gene, which is genetically independent of the Rf1 gene. However, not much is known about the mechanism(s). In a study to examine whether the mechanism involved in fertility restoration by Ifr1 is analogous to restoration mediated by Rf1, the transcript profile of B-atp6-orf79 in male-sterile plants was compared with that in fertility restored plants obtained by crossing male-sterile plants with T65(T). The cellular level of unprocessed B-atp6-orf79 RNA was reduced in the restored plants, but no change in processing efficiency or the quantity of B-atp6-orf79 DNA was detected. These results suggest that Ifr1 restores fertility through reducing either the transcription rate of B-atp6-orf79 or the stability of its primary transcripts, a mechanism distinct from that involved in fertility restoration of BT-type CMS by Rf1.

17157544	Novel transgenic rice overexpressing anthocyanidin synthase accumulates a mixture of flavonoids leading to an increased antioxidant potential.	2007	Metab Eng	In addition to their plant-associated functions, flavonoids act as antioxidants against harmful free radicals in animals. Genetic engineering of food crops for a mix of antioxidant flavonoids is highly beneficial in promoting human health. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) is one of the four dioxygenases (DOX) of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the formation of anthocyanidins from leucoanthocyanidins. To investigate whether ANS mediates different DOX reactions of the pathway and produces a mix of flavonoids, the rice ANS cDNA was cloned and overexpressed in a rice mutant Nootripathu (NP). This mutant accumulates proanthocyanidins exclusively in pericarp and absolutely no anthocyanins in any tissue. In silico sequence analysis revealed that ANS contains a double-stranded beta helix and shows high sequence similarity with other DOXs of the pathway including flavonol synthase, flavonone 3beta-hydroxylase and flavone synthase I. Bacterially expressed ANS protein converted dihydroquercetin to quercetin and Pro(35S):ANS complemented the maize a2 mutant in producing anthocyanins in aleurone, suggesting that ANS functions as a DOX with different flavonoid substrates. Similarly, transgenic NP plants overexpressing Pro(MAS):ANS channeled the proanthocaynidin precursors to the production of anthocyanins in pericarp. Transgenics showed approximately ten and four-fold increase in the ANS transcripts and enzyme activity, respectively. As a result, these plants showed an increased accumulation of a mixture of flavonoids and anthocyanins, with a concomitant decrease in proanthocyanidins, suggesting that ANS may act directly on different flavonoid substrates of DOX reactions. Thus, overexpression of ANS in a rice mutant resulted in novel transgenic rice with a mixture of flavonoids and an enhanced antioxidant potential.
20522726	Orthologous comparisons of the Hd1 region across genera reveal Hd1 gene lability within diploid Oryza species and disruptions to microsynteny in Sorghum.	2010	Mol Biol Evol	Heading date is one of the most important quantitative traits responsible for the domestication of rice. We compared a 155-kb reference segment of the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genome surrounding Hd1, a major heading date gene in rice, with orthologous regions from nine diploid Oryza species that diverged over a relatively short time frame (∼16 My) to study sequence evolution around a domestication locus. The orthologous Hd1 region from Sorghum bicolor was included to compare and contrast the evolution in a more distant relative of rice. Consistent with other observations at the adh1/adh2, monoculm1, and sh2/a1 loci in grass species, we found high gene colinearity in the Hd1 region amidst size differences that were lineage specific and long terminal repeat retrotransposon driven. Unexpectedly, the Hd1 gene was deleted in O. glaberrima, whereas the O. rufipogon and O. punctata copies had degenerative mutations, suggesting that other heading date loci might compensate for the loss or nonfunctionality of Hd1 in these species. Compared with the japonica Hd1 region, the orthologous region in sorghum exhibited micro-rearrangements including gene translocations, seven additional genes, and a gene triplication and truncation event predating the divergence from Oryza.
20584132	Molecular evolution of shattering loci in U.S. weedy rice.	2010	Mol Ecol	Cultivated rice fields worldwide are plagued with weedy rice, a conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). The persistence of weedy rice has been attributed, in part, to its ability to shatter (disperse) seed prior to crop harvesting. In the United States, separately evolved weedy rice groups have been shown to share genomic identity with exotic domesticated cultivars. Here, we investigate the shattering phenotype in a collection of U.S. weedy rice accessions, as well as wild and cultivated relatives. We find that all U.S. weedy rice groups shatter seeds easily, despite multiple origins, and in contrast to a decrease in shattering ability seen in cultivated groups. We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering. Our data constitute the strongest evidence to date of an evolution of weeds from domesticated backgrounds. The combination of a shared cultivar sh4 allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests that U.S. weedy rice have re-acquired the shattering trait after divergence from their progenitors through alternative genetic mechanisms.
20416079	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication.	2010	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Various evolutionary models have been proposed to interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, which provides substrates on which evolution selection could act. In particular, domestication, as a special selection, has played important role in crop cultivation with divergence of many genes controlling important agronomic traits. Recent studies have indicated that a pair of duplicate genes was often sub-functionalized from their ancestral functions held by the parental genes. We previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase (CWI) gene GIF1 that plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the promoter region. Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function through independent selection.

RESULTS: Through synteny analysis, we show that GIF1 and another cell-wall invertase gene OsCIN1 were paralogues derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses. Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region. GIF1 and OsCIN1 have evolved into different expression patterns and probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity. Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other unrecognized biological process.

CONCLUSION: How gene duplication and divergence contribute to genetic novelty and morphological adaptation has been an interesting issue to geneticists and biologists. Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop. Our results also further support the established hypothesis that gene duplication with sub-functionalization could be one solution for genetic adaptive conflict.
20429951	Sequence variation and selection of small RNAs in domesticated rice.	2010	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Endogenous non-coding small RNAs (21-24 nt) play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants. Domestication selection is the most important evolutionary force in shaping crop genomes. The extent of polymorphism at small RNA loci in domesticated rice and whether small RNA loci are targets of domestication selection have not yet been determined.

RESULTS: A polymorphism survey of 94 small RNA loci (88 MIRNAs, four TAS3 loci and two miRNA-like long hairpins) was conducted in domesticated rice, generating 2 Mb of sequence data. Many mutations (substitution or insertion/deletion) were observed at small RNA loci in domesticated rice, e.g. 12 mutation sites were observed in the mature miRNA sequences of 11 MIRNAs (12.5% of the investigated MIRNAs). Several small RNA loci showed significant signals for positive selection and/or potential domestication selection.

CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variation at miRNAs and other small RNAs is higher than expected in domesticated rice. Like protein-coding genes, non-coding small RNA loci could be targets of domestication selection and play an important role in rice domestication and improvement.
20585576	OsPIE1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING1, is essential for embryo development.	2010	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The SWR1 complex is important for the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin necessary to robustly regulate gene expression during growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the catalytic subunit of the SWR1-like complex, encoded by PIE1 (PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING1), has been shown to function in multiple developmental processes including flowering time pathways and petal number regulation. However, the function of the PIE1 orthologs in monocots remains unknown.

METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We report the identification of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog, OsPIE1. Although OsPIE1 does not exhibit a conserved exon/intron structure as Arabidopsis PIE1, its encoded protein is highly similar to PIE1, sharing 53.9% amino acid sequence identity. OsPIE1 also has a very similar expression pattern as PIE1. Furthermore, transgenic expression of OsPIE1 completely rescued both early flowering and extra petal number phenotypes of the Arabidopsis pie1-2 mutant. However, homozygous T-DNA insertional mutants of OsPIE1 in rice were embryonically lethal, in contrast to the viable mutants in the orthologous genes for yeast, Drosophila and Arabidopsis (Swr1, DOMINO and PIE1, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our results suggest that OsPIE1 is the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis PIE1 and plays an essential role in rice embryo development.
20852017	The bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae overcomes rice defenses by regulating host copper redistribution.	2010	Plant Cell	Pathogen effectors are virulence factors causing plant diseases. How the host targets of these effectors facilitate pathogen infection is largely unknown. An effector of Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) transcriptionally activates rice (Oryza sativa) susceptibility gene Xa13 to cause bacterial blight disease. Xa13 encodes an indispensable plasma membrane protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes with unknown biochemical function. We show that the XA13 protein cooperates with two other proteins, COPT1 and COPT5, to promote removal of copper from xylem vessels, where Xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease. Copper, an essential micronutrient of plants and an important element for a number of pesticides in agriculture, suppresses Xoo growth. Xoo strain PXO99 is more sensitive to copper than other strains; its infection of rice is associated with activation of XA13, COPT1, and COPT5, which modulate copper redistribution in rice. The involvement of XA13 in copper redistribution has led us to propose a mechanism of bacterial virulence.
20653085	Ecological divergence in the presence of gene flow in two closely related Oryza species (Oryza rufipogon and O. nivara).	2010	Mol Ecol	Ecological divergence plays a prominent role in the process of speciation, but how divergence occurs in the face of gene flow is still less clear, and remains controversial among evolutionists. Here we investigated the nucleotide diversity, divergence and gene flow between Oryza nivara and O. rufipogon using sequences of seven chloroplast and nuclear loci. By analysing samples from 26 wild populations across the geographic ranges of the two species, we showed that both species were highly structured and O. rufipogon maintained a higher level of species-wide diversity than O. nivara. Notably, phylogenetic, amova and FST analyses were unable to detect significant nucleotide differentiation between the two species. We estimated that the two species began to diverge at c. 0.16 million years ago. Our coalescent-based simulations strongly rejected the simple isolation model of zero migration between species, but rather provided unambiguous evidence of bidirectional gene flow between species, particularly from O. rufipogon to O. nivara. Our simulations also indicated that gene flow was recurrent during the divergence process rather than arising from secondary contact after allopatric divergence. In conjunction with different morphological and life-history traits and habitat preference in the two species, this study supports the hypothesis that these Oryza species are better treated as ecotypes that diverged quite recently and are still under the process of divergence. Importantly, we demonstrate the ecological divergence between O. rufipogon and O. nivara in the presence of significant gene flow, implying that natural selection plays a primary role in driving the divergence of the two Oryza species.
16514016	Characterization of the plant-specific BREVIS RADIX gene family reveals limited genetic redundancy despite high sequence conservation.	2006	Plant Physiol	To date, the function of most genes in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome is unknown. Here we present the first analysis of the novel, plant-specific BRX (BREVIS RADIX) gene family. BRX has been identified as a modulator of root growth through a naturally occurring loss-of-function allele. The biochemical function of BRX is enigmatic, however several domains in BRX are conserved in the proteins encoded by the related BRX-like (BRXL) genes. The similarity between Arabidopsis BRXL proteins within these domains ranges from 84% to 93%. Nevertheless, analysis of brx brx-like multiple mutants indicates that functional redundancy of BRXLs is limited. This results mainly from differences in protein activity, as demonstrated by assaying the propensity of constitutively expressed BRXL cDNAs to rescue the brx phenotype. Among the genes tested, only BRXL1 can replace BRX in this assay. Nevertheless, BRXL1 does not act redundantly with BRX in vivo, presumably because it is expressed at a much lower level than BRX. BRX and BRXL1 similarity is most pronounced in a characteristic tandem repeat domain, which we named BRX domain. One copy of this domain is also present in the PRAF (PH, RCC1, and FYVE)-like family proteins. The BRX domain mediates homotypic and heterotypic interactions within and between the BRX and PRAF protein families in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and therefore likely represents a novel protein-protein interaction domain. The importance of this domain for BRX activity in planta is underscored by our finding that expression of the C-terminal fragment of BRX, comprising the two BRX domains, is largely sufficient to rescue the brx phenotype.
16673940	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection.	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
17334827	A novel mutated acetolactate synthase gene conferring specific resistance to pyrimidinyl carboxy herbicides in rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is the first common enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of branched-chain amino acids. Mutations of specific amino acids in ALS have been known to confer resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides such as sulfonylureas and pyrimidinyl carboxy (PC) herbicides. However, mutations conferring exclusive resistance to PC have not yet been reported to date. We selected PC resistant rice calli, which were derived from anther culture, using one of the PCs, bispyribac-sodium (BS), as a selection agent. Two lines of BS-resistant plants carrying a novel mutation, the 95th Glycine to Alanine (G95A), in ALS were obtained. In vitro ALS activity assay indicated that the recombinant protein of G95A-mutated ALS (ALS-G95A) conferred highly specific resistance to PC herbicides. In order to determine if the ALS-G95A gene could be used as a selection marker for rice transformation, the ALS-G95A gene was connected to ubiquitin promoter and introduced into rice. PC resistant plants containing integrated ALS-G95A gene were obtained after selection with BS as a selection agent. In conclusion, novel G95A mutated ALS gene confers highly specific resistant to PC-herbicides and can be used as a selection marker.
16473545	Negative regulation of defence and stress genes by EAR-motif-containing repressors.	2006	Trends Plant Sci	Although positive control or activation mechanism(s) involved in plant defence- and stress-related gene expression is relatively well studied, little is known about what keeps defensive armoury under control when not needed. Recent reports suggest that transcriptional repression of gene expression by EAR-motif-containing repressor proteins plays a key role in modulating plant defence and stress responses.
21119645	New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield.	2010	Nat Commun	The use of fertilizer results in tall rice plants that are susceptible to lodging and results in reduced plant yields. In this study, using chromosome segment substitution lines, we identified an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for culm strength, which was designated STRONG CULM2 (SCM2). Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure. A near-isogenic line carrying SCM2 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene. Although SCM2 is a gain-of-function mutant of APO1, it does not have the negative effects reported for APO1 overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology. The identification of lodging-resistance genes by QTL analysis combined with positional cloning is a useful approach for improving lodging resistance and overall productivity in rice.
20163552	The role of the rice aquaporin Lsi1 in arsenite efflux from roots.	2010	New Phytol	*When supplied with arsenate (As(V)), plant roots extrude a substantial amount of arsenite (As(III)) to the external medium through as yet unidentified pathways. The rice (Oryza sativa) silicon transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1, an aquaporin channel) is the major entry route of arsenite into rice roots. Whether Lsi1 also mediates arsenite efflux was investigated. *Expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced arsenite efflux, indicating that Lsi1 facilitates arsenite transport bidirectionally. *Arsenite was the predominant arsenic species in arsenate-exposed rice plants. During 24-h exposure to 5 mum arsenate, rice roots extruded arsenite to the external medium rapidly, accounting for 60-90% of the arsenate uptake. A rice mutant defective in Lsi1 (lsi1) extruded significantly less arsenite than the wild-type rice and, as a result, accumulated more arsenite in the roots. By contrast, Lsi2 mutation had little effect on arsenite efflux to the external medium. *We conclude that Lsi1 plays a role in arsenite efflux in rice roots exposed to arsenate. However, this pathway accounts for only 15-20% of the total efflux, suggesting the existence of other efflux transporters.
15111712	Dof domain proteins: plant-specific transcription factors associated with diverse phenomena unique to plants.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Dof (DNA-binding with one finger) domain proteins are plant-specific transcription factors with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which presumably includes a single C(2)-C(2) zinc finger. During the past decade, numerous Dof domain proteins have been identified in both monocots and dicots including maize, barley, wheat, rice, tobacco, Arabidopsis, pumpkin, potato, and pea. Biochemical, molecular biological and molecular genetic analyses revealed that Dof domain proteins function as a transcriptional activator or a repressor involved in diverse plant-specific biological processes. Although more physiological roles of Dof domain proteins would be elucidated in future because of numerous Dof domain proteins in plants, it is already evident that the Dof domain proteins play critical roles as transcriptional regulators in plant growth and development. Here I summarize our current knowledge about Dof domain proteins.
12475498	The Dof family of plant transcription factors.	2002	Trends Plant Sci	Dof proteins are members of a major family of plant transcription factors. The proteins have similar DNA-binding properties because of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. However, recent studies are disclosing their diverse roles in gene expression when associated with plant-specific phenomena including light, phytohormone and defense responses, seed development and germination. Based on the structural diversity indicated by the complete catalog of Arabidopsis Dof proteins, Dof genes appear to have evolved multiple times, preceding and paralleling the diversification of angiosperms. Such gene multiplication might have led to the functional diversification of Dof proteins proceeding differently in distinct plant species.
15316287	Genome-wide analysis of the GRAS gene family in rice and Arabidopsis.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Members of the GRAS gene family encode transcriptional regulators that have diverse functions in plant growth and development such as gibberellin signal transduction, root radial patterning, axillary meristem formation, phytochrome A signal transduction, and gametogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis identified 57 and 32 GRAS genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. Here, we provide a complete overview of this gene family, describing the gene structure, gene expression, chromosome localization, protein motif organization, phylogenetic analysis, and comparative analysis between rice and Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis divides the GRAS gene family into eight subfamilies, which have distinct conserved domains and functions. Both genome/segmental duplication and tandem duplication contributed to the expansion of the GRAS gene family in the rice and Arabidopsis genomes. The existence of GRAS-like genes in bryophytes suggests that GRAS is an ancient family of transcription factors, which arose before the appearance of land plants over 400 million years ago.
17655651	DWARF10, an RMS1/MAX4/DAD1 ortholog, controls lateral bud outgrowth in rice.	2007	Plant J	Plant architecture is mostly determined by shoot branching patterns. Apical dominance is a well-known control mechanism in the development of branching patterns, but little is known regarding its role in monocots such as rice. Here, we show that the concept of apical dominance can be applied to tiller bud outgrowth of rice. In dwarf10 (d10), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced. D10 is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching. D10 expression predominantly occurs in vascular cells in most organs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of D10 mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin. Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1). No such effects were found for D3 or HTD1, the MAX2 and MAX3 orthologs, respectively, of rice. These findings imply that D10 transcription might be a critical step in the regulation of the branching inhibitor pathway. In addition, we present observations that suggest that FINE CULM1 (FC1), a rice ortholog of teosinte branched 1 (tb1), possibly works independently of the branching inhibitor pathway.
19825016	SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 (AP1M1) and is responsible for spotted leaf and early senescence in rice (Oryza sativa).	2010	New Phytol	To expand our understanding of cell death in plant defense responses, we isolated a novel rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf mutant (spl28) that displays a lesion mimic phenotype in the absence of pathogen attack through treatment of Hwacheongbyeo (an elite Korean japonica cultivar) with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Early stage development of the spl28 mutant was normal. However, after flowering, spl28 mutants exhibited a significant decrease in chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, and photosystem II efficiency, and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phytoalexin, callose, and autofluorescent phenolic compounds that localized in or around the lesions. The spl28 mutant also exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight. Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that SPL28 encodes a clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1, medium subunit micro 1 (AP1M1), which is involved in the post-Golgi trafficking pathway. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of SPL28 (SPL28::GFP) localized to the Golgi apparatus, and expression of SPL28 complemented the membrane trafficking defect of apm1-1 Delta yeast mutants. SPL28 was ubiquitously expressed and contained a highly conserved adaptor complex medium subunit (ACMS) family domain. SPL28 appears to be involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, and SPL28 dysfunction causes the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions, leading to the initiation of leaf senescence.

21637817	OsSpo11-4, a rice homologue of the archaeal TopVIA protein, mediates double-strand DNA cleavage and interacts with OsTopVIB.	2011	PLoS One	DNA topoisomerase VI from Archaea, a heterotetrameric complex composed of two TopVIA and two TopVIB subunits, is involved in altering DNA topology during replication, transcription and chromosome segregation by catalyzing DNA strand transfer through transient double-strand breaks. The sequenced yeast and animal genomes encode only one homologue of the archaeal TopVIA subunit, namely Spo11, and no homologue of the archaeal TopVIB subunit. In yeast, Spo11 is essential for initiating meiotic recombination and this function appears conserved among other eukaryotes. In contrast to yeast and animals, studies in Arabidopsis and rice have identified three Spo11/TopVIA homologues and one TopVIB homologue in plants. Here, we further identified two novel Spo11/TopVIA homologues (named OsSpo11-4 and OsSpo11-5, respectively) that exist just in the monocot model plant Oryza sativa, indicating that at least five Spo11/TopVIA homologues are present in the rice genome. To reveal the biochemical function of the two novel Spo11/TopVIA homologues, we first examined the interactions among OsSpo11-1, OsSpo11-4, OsSpo11-5, and OsTopVIB by yeast two-hybrid assay. The results showed that OsSpo11-4 and OsTopVIB can self-interact strongly and among the 3 examined OsSpo11 proteins, only OsSpo11-4 interacted with OsTopVIB. Pull-down assay confirmed the interaction between OsSpo11-4 and OsTopVIB, which indicates that OsSpo11-4 may interact with OsTopVIB in vivo. Further in vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that among the above 4 proteins, only OsSpo11-4 exhibited double-strand DNA cleavage activity and its enzymatic activity appears dependent on Mg(2+) and independent of OsTopVIB, despite its interaction with OsTopVIB. We further analyzed the biological function of OsSpo11-4 by RNA interference and found that down-regulated expression of OsSpo11-4 led to defects in male meiosis, indicating OsSpo11-4 is required for meiosis.
21646530	Artificial selection for a green revolution gene during japonica rice domestication.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The semidwarf phenotype has been extensively selected during modern crop breeding as an agronomically important trait. Introduction of the semidwarf gene, semi-dwarf1 (sd1), which encodes a gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, made significant contributions to the "green revolution" in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here we report that SD1 was involved not only in modern breeding including the green revolution, but also in early steps of rice domestication. We identified two SNPs in O. sativa subspecies (ssp.) japonica SD1 as functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) responsible for shorter culm length and low gibberellin biosynthetic activity. Genetic diversity analysis among O. sativa ssp. japonica and indica, along with their wild ancestor O. rufipogon Griff, revealed that these FNPs clearly differentiate the japonica landrace and O. rufipogon. We also found a dramatic reduction in nucleotide diversity around SD1 only in the japonica landrace, not in the indica landrace or O. rufipogon. These findings indicate that SD1 has been subjected to artificial selection in rice evolution and that the FNPs participated in japonica domestication, suggesting that ancient humans already used the green revolution gene.
21602323	Developing rice with high yield under phosphorus deficiency: Pup1 sequence to application.	2011	Plant Physiol	The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Phosphorus uptake1 (Pup1) confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency in soil and is currently one of the most promising QTLs for the development of tolerant rice (Oryza sativa) varieties. To facilitate targeted introgression of Pup1 into intolerant varieties, the gene models predicted in the Pup1 region in the donor variety Kasalath were used to develop gene-based molecular markers that are evenly distributed over the fine-mapped 278-kb QTL region. To validate the gene models and optimize the markers, gene expression analyses and partial allelic sequencing were conducted. The markers were tested in more than 80 diverse rice accessions revealing three main groups with different Pup1 allele constitution. Accessions with tolerant (group I) and intolerant (group III) Pup1 alleles were distinguished from genotypes with Kasalath alleles at some of the analyzed loci (partial Pup1; group II). A germplasm survey additionally confirmed earlier data showing that Pup1 is largely absent from irrigated rice varieties but conserved in varieties and breeding lines adapted to drought-prone environments. A core set of Pup1 markers has been defined, and sequence polymorphisms suitable for single-nucleotide polymorphism marker development for high-throughput genotyping were identified. Following a marker-assisted backcrossing approach, Pup1 was introgressed into two irrigated rice varieties and three Indonesian upland varieties. First phenotypic evaluations of the introgression lines suggest that Pup1 is effective in different genetic backgrounds and environments and that it has the potential to significantly enhance grain yield under field conditions.
20924028	Root-specific transcript profiling of contrasting rice genotypes in response to salinity stress.	2011	Mol Plant	Elevated salinity imposes osmotic and ion toxicity stresses on living cells and requires a multitude of responses in order to enable plant survival. Building on earlier work profiling transcript levels in rice (Oryza sativa) shoots of FL478, a salt-tolerant indica recombinant inbred line, and IR29, a salt-sensitive cultivar, transcript levels were compared in roots of these two accessions as well as in the roots of two additional salt-tolerant indica genotypes, the landrace Pokkali and the recombinant inbred line IR63731. The aim of this study was to compare transcripts in the sensitive and the tolerant lines in order to identify genes likely to be involved in plant salinity tolerance, rather than in responses to salinity per se. Transcript profiles of several gene families with known links to salinity tolerance are described (e.g. HKTs, NHXs). The putative function of a set of genes identified through their salt responsiveness, transcript levels, and/or chromosomal location (i.e. underneath QTLs for salinity tolerance) is also discussed. Finally, the parental origin of the Saltol region in FL478 is further investigated. Overall, the dataset presented appears to be robust and it seems likely that this system could provide a reliable strategy for the discovery of novel genes involved in salinity tolerance.
16617180	A plant locus essential for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) biosynthesis originated from a fusion of four eubacterial genes.	2006	J Biol Chem	Phylloquinone is a compound present in all photosynthetic plants serving as cofactor for Photosystem I-mediated electron transport. Newly identified seedling-lethal Arabidopsis thaliana mutants impaired in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone possess reduced Photosystem I activity. The affected gene, called PHYLLO, consists of a fusion of four previously individual eubacterial genes, menF, menD, menC, and menH, required for the biosynthesis of phylloquinone in photosynthetic cyanobacteria and the respiratory menaquinone in eubacteria. The fact that homologous men genes reside as polycistronic units in eubacterial chromosomes and in plastomes of red algae strongly suggests that PHYLLO derived from a plastid operon during endosymbiosis. The principle architecture of the fused PHYLLO locus is conserved in the nuclear genomes of plants, green algae, and the diatom alga Thalassiosira pseudonana. The latter arose from secondary endosymbiosis of a red algae and a eukaryotic host indicating selective driving forces for maintenance and/or independent generation of the composite gene cluster within the nuclear genomes. Besides, individual menF genes, encoding active isochorismate synthases (ICS), have been established followed by splitting of the essential 3' region of the menF module of PHYLLO only in genomes of higher plants. This resulted in inactivation of the ICS activity encoded by PHYLLO and enabled a metabolic branch from the phylloquinone biosynthetic route to independently regulate the synthesis of salicylic acid required for plant defense. Therefore, gene fusion, duplication, and fission events adapted a eubacterial multienzymatic system to the metabolic requirements of plants.
21515697	PERSISTENT TAPETAL CELL1 encodes a PHD-finger protein that is required for tapetal cell death and pollen development in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	In higher plants, timely degradation of tapetal cells, the innermost sporophytic cells of the anther wall layer, is a prerequisite for the development of viable pollen grains. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism underlying programmed tapetal cell development and degradation. Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT TAPETAL CELL1 (PTC1), which controls programmed tapetal development and functional pollen formation. The evolutionary significance of PTC1 was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PTC1 encodes a PHD-finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild-type tapetal cells initiate a typical apoptosis-like cell death. Even though ptc1 mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms1 in a lack of tapetal DNA fragmentation, delayed tapetal degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the ptc1 mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled tapetal proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis-like tapetal death. Microarray analysis indicated that 2,417 tapetum- and microspore-expressed genes, which are principally associated with tapetal development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in ptc1 anthers. Moreover, the regulatory role of PTC1 in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS1 and other rice anther developmental regulators. These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of PTC1/MS1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development.
21221134	Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence.	2011	Cell Res	Emerging evidence suggests that E3 ligases play critical roles in diverse biological processes, including innate immune responses in plants. However, the mechanism of the E3 ligase involvement in plant innate immunity is unclear. We report that a rice gene, OsBBI1, encoding a RING finger protein with E3 ligase activity, mediates broad-spectrum disease resistance. The expression of OsBBI1 was induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, as well as chemical inducers, benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid. Biochemical analysis revealed that OsBBI1 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Genetic analysis revealed that the loss of OsBBI1 function in a Tos17-insertion line increased susceptibility, while the overexpression of OsBBI1 in transgenic plants conferred enhanced resistance to multiple races of M. oryzae. This indicates that OsBBI1 modulates broad-spectrum resistance against the blast fungus. The OsBBI1-overexpressing plants showed higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation in cells and higher levels of phenolic compounds and cross-linking of proteins in cell walls at infection sites by M. oryzae compared with wild-type (WT) plants. The cell walls were thicker in the OsBBI1-overexpressing plants and thinner in the mutant plants than in the WT plants. Our results suggest that OsBBI1 modulates broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus by modifying cell wall defence responses. The functional characterization of OsBBI1 provides insight into the E3 ligase-mediated innate immunity, and a practical tool for constructing broad-spectrum resistance against the most destructive disease in rice.
21400109	Genetic diversity and domestication history of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) as inferred from multiple gene sequences.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Nucleotide variation in 14 unlinked nuclear genes was investigated in species-wide samples of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and its wild progenitor (O. barthii). Average estimates of nucleotide diversity were extremely low in both species (θ (sil) = 0.0007 for O. glaberrima; θ (sil) = 0.0024 for O. barthii). About 70% less diversity was found in O. glaberrima than in its progenitor O. barthii. Coalescent simulation indicated that such dramatic reduction of nucleotide diversity in African rice could be explained mainly by a severe bottleneck during its domestication. The progenitor of African rice maintained also low genetic diversity, which may be attributed to small effective population size in O. barthii. Self-pollinating would be another factor leading to the unusually low diversity in both species. Genealogical analyses showed that all O. glaberrima accessions formed a strongly supported cluster with seven O. barthii individuals that were sampled exclusively from the proposed domestication centers of African rice. Population structure and principal component analyses found that the O. glaberrima group was homogeneous with no obvious genetic subdivision, in contrast to the heterogeneous O. barthii cluster. These findings support a single domestication origin of African rice in areas of the Upper Niger and Sahelian Rivers.
20194759	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase intrinsically located in the chloroplast of rice plays a crucial role in ammonium assimilation.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a key enzyme of primary metabolism in bacteria, algae, and vascular plants, and is believed to be cytosolic. Here we show that rice (Oryza sativa L.) has a plant-type PEPC, Osppc4, that is targeted to the chloroplast. Osppc4 was expressed in all organs tested and showed high expression in the leaves. Its expression in the leaves was confined to mesophyll cells, and Osppc4 accounted for approximately one-third of total PEPC protein in the leaf blade. Recombinant Osppc4 was active in the PEPC reaction, showing V(max) comparable to cytosolic isozymes. Knockdown of Osppc4 expression by the RNAi technique resulted in stunting at the vegetative stage, which was much more marked when rice plants were grown with ammonium than with nitrate as the nitrogen source. Comparison of leaf metabolomes of ammonium-grown plants suggested that the knockdown suppressed ammonium assimilation and subsequent amino acid synthesis by reducing levels of organic acids, which are carbon skeleton donors for these processes. We also identified the chloroplastic PEPC gene in other Oryza species, all of which are adapted to waterlogged soil where the major nitrogen source is ammonium. This suggests that, in addition to glycolysis, the genus Oryza has a unique route to provide organic acids for ammonium assimilation that involves a chloroplastic PEPC, and that this route is crucial for growth with ammonium. This work provides evidence for diversity of primary ammonium assimilation in the leaves of vascular plants.
20840506	OsHMA3, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in rice by mediating efflux into vacuoles.	2011	New Phytol	• The cadmium (Cd) over-accumulating rice (Oryza sativa) cv Cho-Ko-Koku was previously shown to have an enhanced rate of root-to-shoot Cd translocation. This trait is controlled by a single recessive allele located at qCdT7. • In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates. The subcellular localization and Cd-transporting activity of the gene products were also investigated. • The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter. OsHMA3 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to vacuolar membranes in plants and yeast. An OsHMA3 transgene complemented Cd sensitivity in a yeast mutant that lacks the ability to transport Cd into vacuoles. By contrast, OsHMA3mc did not complement the Cd sensitivity of this yeast mutant, indicating that the OsHMA3mc transport function was lost. • We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating rice plants has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles. This defect results in Cd translocation to the shoots in higher concentrations. These data demonstrate the importance of vacuolar sequestration for Cd accumulation in rice.
21388416	Cadmium retention in rice roots is influenced by cadmium availability, chelation and translocation.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Analysis of rice plants exposed to a broad range of relatively low and environmentally realistic Cd concentrations showed that the root capacity to retain Cd ions rose from 49 to 79%, corresponding to increases in the external Cd²+ concentration in the 0.01-1 µM range. Fractioning of Cd ions retained by roots revealed that different events along the metal sequestration pathway (i.e. chelation by thiols, vacuolar compartmentalization, adsorption) contributed to Cd immobilization in the roots. However, large amounts of Cd ions (around 24% of the total amount) predictable as potentially mobile were still found in all conditions, while the amount of Cd ions loaded in the xylem seemed to have already reached saturation at 0.1 µM Cd²+, suggesting that Cd translocation may also play an indirect role in determining Cd root retention, especially at the highest external concentrations. In silico search and preliminary analyses in yeast suggest OsHMA2 as a good candidate for the control of Cd xylem loading in rice. Taken as a whole, data indicate Cd chelation, compartmentalization, adsorption and translocation processes as components of a complex 'firewall system' which acts in limiting Cd translocation from the root to the shoot and which reaches different equilibrium positions depending on Cd external concentration.
20796245	Chloroplast genome sequences from total DNA for plant identification.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Chloroplast DNA sequence data are a versatile tool for plant identification or barcoding and establishing genetic relationships among plant species. Different chloroplast loci have been utilized for use at close and distant evolutionary distances in plants, and no single locus has been identified that can distinguish between all plant species. Advances in DNA sequencing technology are providing new cost-effective options for genome comparisons on a much larger scale. Universal PCR amplification of chloroplast sequences or isolation of pure chloroplast fractions, however, are non-trivial. We now propose the analysis of chloroplast genome sequences from massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of total DNA as a simple and cost-effective option for plant barcoding, and analysis of plant relationships to guide gene discovery for biotechnology. We present chloroplast genome sequences of five grass species derived from MPS of total DNA. These data accurately established the phylogenetic relationships between the species, correcting an apparent error in the published rice sequence. The chloroplast genome may be the elusive single-locus DNA barcode for plants.
16887895	Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor in graminaceous plants.	2006	J Exp Bot	To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions.
21494675	Molecular aspect of good eating quality formation in Japonica rice.	2011	PLoS One	The composition of amylopectin is the determinant of rice eating quality under certain threshold of protein content and the ratio of amylose and amylopectin. In molecular biology level, the fine structure of amylopectin is determined by relative activities of starch branching enzyme (SBE), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), and soluble starch synthase (SSS) in rice grain under the same ADP-Glucose level. But the underlying mechanism of eating quality in molecular biology level remains unclear. This paper reports the differences on major parameters such as SNP and insertion-deletion sites, RNA expressions, and enzyme activities associated with eating quality of japonica varieties. Eight japonica rice varieties with significant differences in various eating quality parameters such as palatability and protein content were used in this experiment. Association analysis between nucleotide polymorphism and eating quality showed that S12 and S13 loci in SBE1, S55 in SSS1, S58 in SSS2A were significantly associated with apparent amylose content, alkali digestion value, setback viscosity, consistency viscosity, pasting temperature, which explained most of the variation in apparent amylose content, setback viscosity, and consistency viscosity; and explained almost all variations in alkali digestion value and pasting temperature. Thirty-five SNPs and insertion-deletions from SBE1, SBE3, GBSS1, SSS1, and SSS2A differentiated high or intermediate palatability rice varieties from low palatability rice varieties. Correlation analysis between enzyme activities and eating quality properties revealed that SBE25 and SSS15/W15 were positively correlated with palatability, whereas GBSS10 and GBSS15 were negatively correlated. Gene expressions showed that SBE1 and SBE3 expressions in high palatability varieties tended to be higher than middle and low palatability varieties. Collectively, SBE1, SBE3, SSS1, and SSS2A, especially SBE1 and SBE3 could improve eating quality, but GBSS1 decreased eating quality. The results indicated the possibility of developing high palatability cultivars through modification of key genes related to japonica rice eating quality formation in starch biosynthesis.
12897262	ARC6 is a J-domain plastid division protein and an evolutionary descendant of the cyanobacterial cell division protein Ftn2.	2003	Plant Cell	Replication of chloroplasts is essential for achieving and maintaining optimal plastid numbers in plant cells. The plastid division machinery contains components of both endosymbiotic and host cell origin, but little is known about the regulation and molecular mechanisms that govern the division process. The Arabidopsis mutant arc6 is defective in plastid division, and its leaf mesophyll cells contain only one or two grossly enlarged chloroplasts. We show here that arc6 chloroplasts also exhibit abnormal localization of the key plastid division proteins FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. Whereas in wild-type plants, the FtsZ proteins assemble into a ring at the plastid division site, chloroplasts in the arc6 mutant contain numerous short, disorganized FtsZ filament fragments. We identified the mutation in arc6 and show that the ARC6 gene encodes a chloroplast-targeted DnaJ-like protein localized to the plastid envelope membrane. An ARC6-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was localized to a ring at the center of the chloroplasts and rescued the chloroplast division defect in the arc6 mutant. The ARC6 gene product is related closely to Ftn2, a prokaryotic cell division protein unique to cyanobacteria. Based on the FtsZ filament morphology observed in the arc6 mutant and in plants that overexpress ARC6, we hypothesize that ARC6 functions in the assembly and/or stabilization of the plastid-dividing FtsZ ring. We also analyzed FtsZ localization patterns in transgenic plants in which plastid division was blocked by altered expression of the division site-determining factor AtMinD. Our results indicate that MinD and ARC6 act in opposite directions: ARC6 promotes and MinD inhibits FtsZ filament formation in the chloroplast.
20465413	Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco.	2010	Phytopathology	Lumazine synthase (LS) catalyzes the penultimate reaction in the multistep riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, which is involved in plant defenses. Plant defenses are often subject to synergistic effects of jasmonic acid and ethylene whereas LS is a regulator of jasmonic acid signal transduction. However, little is known about whether the enzyme contributes to defense responses. To study the role of LS in plant pathogen defenses, we generated transgenic tobacco expressing the rice (Oryza sativa) LS gene, OsLS. OsLS was cloned and found to have strong identity with its homologues in higher plants and less homology to microbial orthologues. The OsLS protein localized to chloroplasts in three OsLS-expressing transgenic tobacco (LSETT) lines characterized as enhanced in growth and defense. Compared with control plants, LSETT had higher content of both riboflavin and the cofactors flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. In LSETT, jasmonic acid and ethylene were elevated, the expression of defense-related genes was induced, levels of resistance to pathogens were enhanced, and resistance was effective to viral, bacterial, and oomycete pathogens. Extents of OsLS expression correlated with increases in flavin, jasmonic acid, and ethylene content, and correlated with increases in resistance levels, suggesting a role for OsLS in defense responses.
18987217	GRASSIUS: a platform for comparative regulatory genomics across the grasses.	2009	Plant Physiol	Transcription factors (TFs) are major players in gene regulatory networks and interactions between TFs and their target genes furnish spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. Establishing the architecture of regulatory networks requires gathering information on TFs, their targets in the genome, and the corresponding binding sites. We have developed GRASSIUS (Grass Regulatory Information Services) as a knowledge-based Web resource that integrates information on TFs and gene promoters across the grasses. In its initial implementation, GRASSIUS consists of two separate, yet linked, databases. GrassTFDB holds information on TFs from maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and rice (Oryza sativa). TFs are classified into families and phylogenetic relationships begin to uncover orthologous relationships among the participating species. This database also provides a centralized clearinghouse for TF synonyms in the grasses. GrassTFDB is linked to the grass TFome collection, which provides clones in recombination-based vectors corresponding to full-length open reading frames for a growing number of grass TFs. GrassPROMDB contains promoter and cis-regulatory element information for those grass species and genes for which enough data are available. The integration of GrassTFDB and GrassPROMDB will be accomplished through GrassRegNet as a first step in representing the architecture of grass regulatory networks. GRASSIUS can be accessed from www.grassius.org.
21510855	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The copper (Cu) transporter (COPT/Ctr) gene family has an important role in the maintenance of Cu homeostasis in different species. The rice COPT-type gene family consists of seven members (COPT1 to COPT7). However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport.

RESULTS: Here we report the molecular and functional characterization of the other five members of the rice COPT gene family (COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7). All members of the rice COPT family have the conserved features of known COPT/Ctr-type Cu transporter genes. Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5. COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 cooperating with COPT6 mediated a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacked the functions of ScCtr1 and ScCtr3 for Cu uptake. COPT7 alone could mediate a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast mutant. None of the seven COPTs alone or in cooperation could complement the phenotypes of S. cerevisiae mutants that lacked the transporter genes either for iron uptake or for zinc uptake. However, these COPT genes, which showed different tissue-specific expression patterns and Cu level-regulated expression patterns, were also transcriptionally influenced by deficiency of iron, manganese, or zinc.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 may cooperate with COPT6, respectively, and COPT7 acts alone for Cu transport in different rice tissues. The endogenous concentrations of iron, manganese, or zinc may influence Cu homeostasis by influencing the expression of COPTs in rice.
21118257	The isolation and characterization of Pik, a rice blast resistance gene which emerged after rice domestication.	2011	New Phytol	• The rice-rice blast pathosystem is of great interest, not only because of the damaging potential of rice blast to the rice crop, but also because both the pathogen and its host are experimentally amenable. The rice blast resistance gene Pik, which is one of the five classical alleles located at the Pik locus on the long arm of chromosome 11, confers high and stable resistance to many Chinese rice blast isolates. • The isolation and functional characterization of Pik were performed in the present study through genetic and genomic approaches. • A combination of Pik-1 and Pik-2 is required for the expression of Pik resistance. Both Pik-1 and Pik-2 encode coiled-coil nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins, and each shares a very high level of protein identity with corresponding proteins encoded by the Pik-m and Pik-p alleles. Pik could be distinguished from other Pik alleles, including Pik-m and Pik-p, by the allele-specific, single-nucleotide polymorphism T1-2944G. • The coupled genes probably did not evolve as a result of a duplication event, and are far from any NBS-LRR R gene characterized. Pik is a younger allele at the locus that probably emerged after rice domestication.
21556707	Different effects of night versus day high temperature on rice quality and accumulation profiling of rice grain proteins during grain filling.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	High temperature has adverse effects on rice yield and quality. The different influences of night high temperature (NHT) and day high temperature (DHT) on rice quality and seed protein accumulation profiles during grain filling in indica rice '9311' were studied in this research. The treatment temperatures of the control, NHT, and DHT were 28°C/20°C, 27°C/35°C, and 35°C/27°C, respectively, and all the treatments were maintained for 20 days. The result of rice quality analysis indicated that compared with DHT, NHT exerted less effect on head rice rate and chalkiness, whereas greater effect on grain weight. Moreover, the dynamic accumulation change profiles of 61 protein spots, differentially accumulated and successfully identified under NHT and DHT conditions, were performed by proteomic approach. The results also showed that the different suppressed extent of accumulation amount of cyPPDKB might result in different grain chalkiness between NHT and DHT. Most identified isoforms of proteins, such as PPDK and pullulanase, displayed different accumulation change patterns between NHT and DHT. In addition, compared with DHT, NHT resulted in the unique accumulation patterns of stress and defense proteins. Taken together, the mechanisms of seed protein accumulation profiles induced by NHT and DHT during grain filling should be different in rice, and the potential molecular basis is discussed in this study.
21396108	Comparative genomics reveals diversity among xanthomonads infecting tomato and pepper.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Bacterial spot of tomato and pepper is caused by four Xanthomonas species and is a major plant disease in warm humid climates. The four species are distinct from each other based on physiological and molecular characteristics. The genome sequence of strain 85-10, a member of one of the species, Xanthomonas euvesicatoria (Xcv) has been previously reported. To determine the relationship of the four species at the genome level and to investigate the molecular basis of their virulence and differing host ranges, draft genomic sequences of members of the other three species were determined and compared to strain 85-10.

RESULTS: We sequenced the genomes of X. vesicatoria (Xv) strain 1111 (ATCC 35937), X. perforans (Xp) strain 91-118 and X. gardneri (Xg) strain 101 (ATCC 19865). The genomes were compared with each other and with the previously sequenced Xcv strain 85-10. In addition, the molecular features were predicted that may be required for pathogenicity including the type III secretion apparatus, type III effectors, other secretion systems, quorum sensing systems, adhesins, extracellular polysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide determinants. Several novel type III effectors from Xg strain 101 and Xv strain 1111 genomes were computationally identified and their translocation was validated using a reporter gene assay. A homolog to Ax21, the elicitor of XA21-mediated resistance in rice, and a functional Ax21 sulfation system were identified in Xcv. Genes encoding proteins with functions mediated by type II and type IV secretion systems have also been compared, including enzymes involved in cell wall deconstruction, as contributors to pathogenicity.

CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic analyses revealed considerable diversity among bacterial spot pathogens, providing new insights into differences and similarities that may explain the diverse nature of these strains. Genes specific to pepper pathogens, such as the O-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide cluster, and genes unique to individual strains, such as novel type III effectors and bacteriocin genes, have been identified providing new clues for our understanding of pathogen virulence, aggressiveness, and host preference. These analyses will aid in efforts towards breeding for broad and durable resistance in economically important tomato and pepper cultivars.
21708230	Proteome profile of maize (Zea Mays L.) leaf tissue at the flowering stage after long-term adjustment to rice black-streaked dwarf virus infection.	2011	Gene	Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a viral disease and causes great yield loss. To better understand the effects of MRDD on plant growth and metabolism, comparative proteomic analysis of leaves from virus-infected and normal plants was performed. In order to eliminate the interference of Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase with low-abundance proteins, total proteins were pre-fractionated by 15% PEG and the proteins from supernatant and precipitated fractions were analyzed by 2-DE, subsequently. Out of approximately 1200 protein spots detected, less than 2% of the spots on the gels were overlapping between the fractions of precipitation and supernatant. We identified 91 differentially accumulated proteins that belong to multiple metabolic/biochemical pathways in plants. Further analysis of these identified proteins indicated that MRDD resulted in dramatic changes in the fundamental metabolism, including glycolysis and starch metabolism, and eventually the significant differences in morphology and development between virus-infected and normal plants. Moreover, MRDD occurrence increased the demands for G-proteins, antioxidant enzymes, lipoxygenases and UDP-glucosyltransferase BX9, which may play important roles in response of plant against virus infection. The results also suggested that MRDD is a complicated disease controlled by multigene participating in different pathways.
21655270	Activation of methanogenesis in arid biological soil crusts despite the presence of oxygen.	2011	PLoS One	Methanogenesis is traditionally thought to occur only in highly reduced, anoxic environments. Wetland and rice field soils are well known sources for atmospheric methane, while aerated soils are considered sinks. Although methanogens have been detected in low numbers in some aerated, and even in desert soils, it remains unclear whether they are active under natural oxic conditions, such as in biological soil crusts (BSCs) of arid regions. To answer this question we carried out a factorial experiment using microcosms under simulated natural conditions. The BSC on top of an arid soil was incubated under moist conditions in all possible combinations of flooding and drainage, light and dark, air and nitrogen headspace. In the light, oxygen was produced by photosynthesis. Methane production was detected in all microcosms, but rates were much lower when oxygen was present. In addition, the δ(13)C of the methane differed between the oxic/oxygenic and anoxic microcosms. While under anoxic conditions methane was mainly produced from acetate, it was almost entirely produced from H(2)/CO(2) under oxic/oxygenic conditions. Only two genera of methanogens were identified in the BSC-Methanosarcina and Methanocella; their abundance and activity in transcribing the mcrA gene (coding for methyl-CoM reductase) was higher under anoxic than oxic/oxygenic conditions, respectively. Both methanogens also actively transcribed the oxygen detoxifying gene catalase. Since methanotrophs were not detectable in the BSC, all the methane produced was released into the atmosphere. Our findings point to a formerly unknown participation of desert soils in the global methane cycle.
21683881	Tissue specificity and diurnal change in gene expression of the sucrose phosphate synthase gene family in rice.	2011	Plant Sci	The rice genome contains 5 isogenes for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), the key enzyme in sucrose synthesis; however, little is known about their transcriptional regulation. In order to determine the expression patterns of the SPS gene family in rice plants, we conducted an expression analysis in various tissues and developmental stages by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. At the transcript level, the rice SPS genes, particularly SPS1, were preferentially expressed in source tissues, whereas SPS2, SPS6, and SPS8 were expressed equally in source and sink tissues. We also investigated diurnal changes in SPS gene expression, SPS activity, and soluble sugar content in leaf blades. Interestingly, the expression of all the SPS genes, particularly that of SPS1 and SPS11, tended to be higher at night when the activation state of the SPS proteins was low, and the mRNA levels of SPS1 and SPS6 were negatively correlated with sucrose content. Furthermore, the temporal patterns of SPS gene expression and sugar content under continuous light conditions suggested the involvement of endogenous rhythm and/or sucrose sensing in the transcriptional regulation of SPS genes. Our data revealed differential expression patterns in the rice SPS gene family and part of the complex mechanisms of their transcriptional control.
21335436	Strategies for engineering a two-celled C(4) photosynthetic pathway into rice.	2011	J Exp Bot	Every day almost one billion people suffer from chronic hunger, and the situation is expected to deteriorate with a projected population growth to 9 billion worldwide by 2050. In order to provide adequate nutrition into the future, rice yields in Asia need to increase by 60%, a change that may be achieved by introduction of the C(4) photosynthetic cycle into rice. The international C(4) Rice Consortium was founded in order to test the feasibility of installing the C(4) engine into rice. This review provides an update on two of the many approaches employed by the C(4) Rice Consortium: namely, metabolic C(4) engineering and identification of determinants of leaf anatomy by mutant screens. The aim of the metabolic C(4) engineering approach is to generate a two-celled C(4) shuttle in rice by expressing the classical enzymes of the NADP-ME C(4) cycle in a cell-appropriate manner. The aim is also to restrict RuBisCO and glycine decarboxylase expression to the bundle sheath (BS) cells of rice in a C(4)-like fashion by specifically down-regulating their expression in rice mesophyll (M) cells. In addition to the changes in biochemistry, two-celled C(4) species show a convergence in leaf anatomy that include increased vein density and reduced numbers of M cells between veins. By screening rice activation-tagged lines and loss-of-function sorghum mutants we endeavour to identify genes controlling these key traits.
21127026	Physiological, genetic, and molecular characterization of a high-Cd-accumulating rice cultivar, Jarjan.	2011	J Exp Bot	Cadmium (Cd) in rice is a major source of Cd intake for people on a staple rice diet. The mechanisms underlying Cd accumulation in rice plant are still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the physiology and genetics of Cd transport in a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Jarjan) of rice (Oryza sativa). Jarjan showed 5- to 34-fold higher Cd accumulation in the shoots and grains than the cultivar Nipponbare, when it was grown in either a non-Cd-contaminated or a Cd-contaminated soil. A short-term uptake experiment showed no significant difference in Cd uptake by the roots between the two cultivars. However, Jarjan translocated 49% of the total Cd taken up to the shoots, whereas Nipponbare retained most of the Cd in the roots. In both concentration- and time-dependent experiments, Jarjan showed a superior capacity for root-to-shoot translocation of Cd. These results indicate that the high-Cd-accumulation phenotype in Jarjan results from efficient translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. Genetic analysis using an F(2) population derived from Jarjan and Nipponbare revealed that plants showing high- and low-Cd-accumulation phenotypes segregated in a 1:3 ratio, indicating that high accumulation in Jarjan is controlled by a single recessive gene. Furthermore, we isolated OsHMA3, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan. The OsHMA3 protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function. Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by OsHMA3 is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan.
21153026	Isolation and characterization of a rice glutathione S-transferase gene promoter regulated by herbicides and hormones.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	OsGSTL2, encoding glutathione S-transferase, is a lambda class gene on chromosome 3 of rice (Oryza sativa L.). RNA blot analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that the transcription of OsGSTL2 in rice roots treated with chlorsulfuron increased significantly. To further understand OsGSTL2 promoter activity, a DNA fragment (GST2171) of 2,171 bp upstream of the OsGSTL2 coding region was isolated. In silico sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains stress-regulated regulatory elements, hormone-responsive elements and three transposable elements. To define the core promoter sequence, a series of 5' truncation derivatives of GST2171 were fused to uidA gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into rice plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The expression of the GST2171::GUS transgene varied considerably. GUS staining indicated that the uidA gene is expressed in young seedlings, older leaves, flowering glumes and seeds, but not in older roots. Quantitative fluorescence assays revealed that the expression of the uidA gene is strong in young seedlings and decreases gradually over a period of 25 days. To our surprise, among the 5' truncation derivatives, the shortest promoter GST525 showed the highest GUS expression, and the second shortest promoter GST962 showed the lowest GUS expression. The uidA gene expression in the roots of transgenic rice seedlings is upregulated by chlorsulfuron, glyphosate, salicylic acid (SA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The possible roles of the repetitive elements on the OsGSTL2 promoter were discussed in terms of transcription repression and promoter induction by herbicides and hormones.
21539752	Evolution of an endofungal lifestyle: Deductions from the Burkholderia rhizoxinica genome.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Burkholderia rhizoxinica is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic zygomycete Rhizopus microsporus, the causative agent of rice seedling blight. The endosymbiont produces the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin for its host. It is vertically transmitted within vegetative spores and is essential for spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the evolution and genetic potential of this model organism, we analysed the whole genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454 - a type strain of endofungal Burkholderia species.

RESULTS: The genome consists of a structurally conserved chromosome and two plasmids. Compared to free-living Burkholderia species, the genome is smaller in size and harbors less transcriptional regulator genes. Instead, we observed accumulation of transposons over the genome. Prediction of primary metabolic pathways and transporters suggests that endosymbionts consume host metabolites like citrate, but might deliver some amino acids and cofactors to the host. The rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster shows evolutionary traces of horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we analysed gene clusters coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Notably, B. rhizoxinica lacks common genes which are dedicated to quorum sensing systems, but is equipped with a large number of virulence-related factors and putative type III effectors.

CONCLUSIONS: B. rhizoxinica is the first endofungal bacterium, whose genome has been sequenced. Here, we present models of evolution, metabolism and tools for host-symbiont interaction of the endofungal bacterium deduced from whole genome analyses. Genome size and structure suggest that B. rhizoxinica is in an early phase of adaptation to the intracellular lifestyle (genome in transition). By analysis of tranporters and metabolic pathways we predict how metabolites might be exchanged between the symbiont and its host. Gene clusters for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. In silico analyses of virulence-associated genes, secreted proteins and effectors might inspire future studies on molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.
21478444	The interconversion of UDP-arabinopyranose and UDP-arabinofuranose is indispensable for plant development in Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Cell	L-Ara, an important constituent of plant cell walls, is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. Nucleotide sugar mutases have been demonstrated to interconvert UDP-Larabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa). These enzymes belong to a small gene family encoding the previously named Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). RGPs are plant-specific cytosolic proteins that tend to associate with the endomembrane system. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the RGP protein family consists of five closely related members. We characterized all five RGPs regarding their expression pattern and subcellular localizations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Enzymatic activity assays of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli identified three of the Arabidopsis RGP protein family members as UDP-L-Ara mutases that catalyze the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-Arap. Coimmunoprecipitation and subsequent liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a distinct interaction network between RGPs in different Arabidopsis organs. Examination of cell wall polysaccharide preparations from RGP1 and RGP2 knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in total L-Ara content (12–31%) compared with wild-type plants. Concomitant downregulation of RGP1 and RGP2 expression results in plants almost completely deficient in cell wall–derived L-Ara and exhibiting severe developmental defects.
21538101	Inducibility of three salinity/abscisic acid-regulated promoters in transgenic rice with gusA reporter gene.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	The present study evaluates the pattern of stress inducibility of one natural promoter (from rice Rab16A) and two synthetically designed promoters, viz., 4X ABRE (abscisic acid-responsive element, having four tandem repeats of ABRE) and 2X ABRC (abscisic acid-responsive complex, having two tandem repeats of ABRE and two copies of coupling elements), in response to varying concentrations of NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA). Each promoter, independently linked to gusA (that encodes β glucuronidase, GUS), was introduced into rice (cv. Khitish) through particle bombardment. The T(2) progenies showed integration of gusA in their genome. The accumulation of gusA transcript, driven by each promoter in T(2) transgenics, increased with increasing salt/ABA concentration, with ABA being the better activator of each promoter. Induction in GUS expression, driven by different promoters, was noted on exogenous salt/ABA treatments in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum induction was observed with 2X ABRC promoter. All the three promoters could drive stress-inducible GUS expression in both vegetative and floral organs. However, prominent GUS expression was noted in the whole seed (both embryo and aleurone layer of endosperm) only by 2X ABRC, whereas it was localized only in the embryo for the other two promoters. Thus, our observation characterizes three efficient salinity/ABA-inducible promoters that have the potentiality in crop biotechnology to drive transgene expression for stress tolerance, whenever abiotic stress is encountered.
21495624	Plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins reduce nitrite to nitric oxide under anoxic conditions.	2011	Biochemistry	The ability of ferrous hemoglobins to reduce nitrite to form nitric oxide has been demonstrated for hemoglobins from animals, including myoglobin, blood cell hemoglobin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin. In all cases, the rate constants for the bimolecular reactions with nitrite are relatively slow, with maximal values of ~5 M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7. Combined with the relatively low concentrations of nitrite found in animal blood plasma (normally no greater than 13 μM), these slow reaction rates are unlikely to contribute significantly to hemoglobin oxidation, nitrite reduction, or NO production. Plants and cyanobacteria, however, must contend with much higher (millimolar) nitrite concentrations necessitated by assimilatory nitrogen metabolism during hypoxic growth, such as the conditions commonly found during flooding or in waterlogged soil. Here we report rate constants for nitrite reduction by a ferrous plant hemoglobin (rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin 1) and a ferrous cyanobacterial hemoglobin from Synechocystis that are more than 10 times faster than those observed for animal hemoglobins. These rate constants, along with the relatively high concentrations of nitrite present during hypoxia, suggest that plant and cyanobacterial hemoglobins could serve as anaerobic nitrite reductases in vivo.
21063744	Negative feedback regulation of microbe-associated molecular pattern-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients by protein phosphorylation.	2011	J Plant Res	Microbe/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs) often induce rises in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) and protein phosphorylation. Though they are postulated to play pivotal roles in plant innate immunity, their molecular links and the regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms for MAMP-induced Ca(2+) mobilization, we have established a transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) cell line stably expressing apoaequorin, and characterized the interrelationship among MAMP-induced changes in [Ca(2+)](cyt), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein phosphorylation. Oligosaccharide and sphingolipid MAMPs induced Ca(2+) transients mainly due to plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx, which were dramatically suppressed by a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (CA). Hydrogen peroxide and hypo-osmotic shock triggered similar [Ca(2+)](cyt) elevations, which were not affected by CA. MAMP-induced protein phosphorylation, which is promoted by CA, has been shown to be required for ROS production and MAPK activation, while it negatively regulates MAMPs-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and may play a crucial role in temporal regulation of [Ca(2+)](cyt) signature.
21414773	Response of compost maturity and microbial community composition to pentachlorophenol (PCP)-contaminated soil during composting.	2011	Bioresour Technol	Two composting piles were prepared by adding to a mixture of rice straw, vegetables and bran: (i) raw soil free from pentachlorophenol (PCP) contamination (pile A) and (ii) PCP-contaminated soil (pile B). It was shown by the results that compost maturity characterized by water soluble carbon (WSC), TOC/TN ratio, germination index (GI) and dehydrogenase activity (DA) was significantly affected by PCP exposure, which resulted in an inferior degree of maturity for pile B. DGGE analysis revealed an inhibited effect of PCP on compost microbial abundance. The bacteria community shifts were mainly consistent with composting factors such as temperature, pH, moisture content and substrates. By contrast, the fungal communities were more sensitive to PCP contamination due to the significant correlation between fungal community shifts and PCP removal. Therefore, the different microbial community compositions for properly evaluating the degree of maturity and PCP contamination were suggested.
21625436	NOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis and Rubisco formation in rice.	2011	PLoS One	NITRIC OXIDE-ASSOCIATED1 (NOA1) encodes a circularly permuted GTPase (cGTPase) known to be essential for ribosome assembly in plants. While the reduced chlorophyll and Rubisco phenotypes were formerly noticed in both NOA1-suppressed rice and Arabidopsis, a detailed insight is still necessary. In this study, by using RNAi transgenic rice, we further demonstrate that NOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll and Rubisco levels. When plants were grown at 30°C, the chlorophyll and Rubisco levels in OsNOA1-silenced plants were only slightly lower than those in WT. However, at 22°C, the silenced plants accumulated far less chlorophyll and Rubisco than WT. It was further revealed that the regulation of chlorophyll and Rubisco occurs at the anabolic level. Etiolated WT seedlings restored chlorophyll and Rubisco accumulations readily once returned to light, at either 30°C or 15°C. Etiolated OsNOA1-silenced plants accumulated chlorophyll and Rubisco to normal levels only at 30°C, and lost this ability at low temperature. On the other hand, de-etiolated OsNOA1-silenced seedlings maintained similar levels of chlorophyll and Rubisco as WT, even after being shifted to 15°C for various times. Further expression analyses identified several candidate genes, including OsPorA (NADPH: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A), OsrbcL (Rubisco large subunit), OsRALyase (Ribosomal RNA apurinic site specific lyase) and OsPuf4 (RNA-binding protein of the Puf family), which may be involved in OsNOA1-regulated chlorophyll biosynthesis and Rubisco formation. Overall, our results suggest OsNOA1 functions in a temperature-dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis, Rubisco formation and plastid development in rice.
21585388	OsSFR6 is a functional rice orthologue of SENSITIVE TO FREEZING-6 and can act as a regulator of COR gene expression, osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2011	New Phytol	The Arabidopsis protein SENSITIVE TO FREEZING-6 (AtSFR6) is required for cold- and drought-inducible expression of COLD-ON REGULATED (COR) genes and, as a consequence, AtSFR6 is essential for osmotic stress and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. Therefore, orthologues of AtSFR6 in crop species represent important candidate targets for future manipulation of stress tolerance. We identified and cloned a homologue of AtSFR6 from rice (Oryza sativa), OsSFR6, and confirmed its orthology in Arabidopsis. OsSFR6 was identified by homology searches, and a full-length coding region isolated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Oryza sativa cDNA. To test for orthology, OsSFR6 was expressed in an Arabidopsis sfr6 loss-of-function mutant background, and restoration of wild-type phenotypes was assessed. Searching the rice genome revealed a single homologue of AtSFR6. Cloning and sequencing the OsSFR6 coding region showed OsSFR6 to have 61.7% identity and 71.1% similarity to AtSFR6 at the predicted protein sequence level. Expression of OsSFR6 in the atsfr6 mutant background restored the wild-type visible phenotype, as well as restoring wild-type levels of COR gene expression and tolerance of osmotic and freezing stresses. OsSFR6 is an orthologue of AtSFR6, and thus a target for future manipulation to improve tolerance to osmotic and other abiotic stresses.
21516334	Molecular characterization and genomic mapping of the pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1) gene family in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	The group 1 pathogenesis-related (PR-1) proteins, known as hallmarks of defense pathways, are encoded by multigene families in plants as evidenced by the presence of 22 and 32 PR-1 genes in the finished Arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively. Here, we report the initial characterization and mapping of 23 PR-1-like (TaPr-1) genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which possesses one of the largest (>16,000 megabases) genomes among monocot crop plants. Sequence analysis revealed that the 23 TaPr-1 genes all contain intron-free open reading frames that encode a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a conserved PR-1-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaPr-1 genes form three major monophyletic groups along with their counterparts in other monocots; each group consists of genes encoding basic, basic with a C-terminal extension, and acidic PR-1 proteins, respectively, suggesting diversity and conservation of PR-1 gene functions in monocot plants. Mapping analysis assisted by untranslated region-specified discrimination (USD) markers and various cytogenetic stocks located the 23 TaPr-1 genes to seven different chromosomes, with the majority mapping to chromosomes of homoeologous groups 5 and 7. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that 12 TaPr-1 genes were induced or up-regulated upon pathogen challenge. Together, this study provides insights to the origin, evolution, homoeologous relationships, and expression patterns of the TaPr-1 genes. The data presented provide critical information for further genome-wide characterization of the wheat PR-1 gene family and the USD markers developed will facilitate genetic and functional analysis of PR-1 genes associated with plant defense and/or other important traits.
21332845	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant J	Jasmonates play important roles in development, stress responses and defense in plants. Here, we report the results of a study using a functional genomics approach that identified a rice basic helix-loop-helix domain gene, OsbHLH148, that conferred drought tolerance as a component of the jasmonate signaling module in rice. OsbHLH148 transcript levels were rapidly increased by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or abscisic acid, and abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity, low temperature and wounding. Transgenic over-expression of OsbHLH148 in rice confers plant tolerance to drought stress. Expression profiling followed by DNA microarray and RNA gel-blot analyses of transgenic versus wild-type rice identified genes that are up-regulated by OsbHLH148 over-expression. These include OsDREB and OsJAZ genes that are involved in stress responses and the jasmonate signaling pathway, respectively. OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine. Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex. The transcription level of OsJAZ1 increased upon exposure of rice to MeJA. These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance. Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate-regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148-OsJAZ-OsCOI1 signaling module in rice.
21249367	Comparative characterization, expression pattern and function analysis of the 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase gene family in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) belong to the old yellow enzyme family of flavoenzymes and form multiple subfamilies in angiosperm plants. In our previous study, a comparative genomic analysis showed that five OPR subfamilies (subs. I-V) occur in monocots, and two subfamilies (subs. I and II) in dicots. Here, a comparative study of five OsOPR genes, representing five subfamilies (I-V) in rice, was performed to provide insights into OPR biochemical properties and physiological importance. Comparative analysis of the three-dimensional structure by homology modeling indicated all five OsOPR proteins contained a highly conserved backbone with (α/β)(8)-barrels, while two middle variable regions (MVR i and ii) were also detected and defined. Analysis of enzymatic characteristics revealed that all five OsOPR fusion proteins exhibit distinct substrate specificity. Different catalytic activity was observed using racemic OPDA and trans-2-hexen-1-al as substrates, suggesting OsOPR family genes participate in two main branches of the octadecanoid pathway, including the allene oxide synthase and hydroperoxide lyase pathways which regulate various developmental processes and/or defense responses. The transcript profiles of five OsOPR genes exhibited strong tissue-specific and inducible expression patterns under abiotic stress, hormones and plant wounding treatments. Furthermore, the transcriptions of OsOPR04-1 (OsOPR11) and OsOPR08-1 (OsOPR7), representing subs. I and II, respectively, were observed in all six selected tissues and with all above-stress treatments. This suggests that these two subfamilies play an important role during different developmental stages and in response to stresses; while the expressions of OsOPR06-1 (OsOPR6), OsOPR01-1 (OsOPR10) and OsOPR02-1 (OsOPR8), representing subs. III, IV and V respectively, were strongly up-regulated with abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) treatments in roots, suggesting these three subfamilies play an important role in responding to hormones especially ABA and IAA signals in roots.
20955180	Screening for resistance against Pseudomonas syringae in rice-FOX Arabidopsis lines identified a putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene that confers resistance to major bacterial and fungal pathogens in Arabidopsis and rice.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Approximately 20,000 of the rice-FOX Arabidopsis transgenic lines, which overexpress 13,000 rice full-length cDNAs at random in Arabidopsis, were screened for bacterial disease resistance by dip inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). The identities of the overexpressed genes were determined in 72 lines that showed consistent resistance after three independent screens. Pst DC3000 resistance was verified for 19 genes by characterizing other independent Arabidopsis lines for the same genes in the original rice-FOX hunting population or obtained by reintroducing the genes into ecotype Columbia by floral dip transformation. Thirteen lines of these 72 selections were also resistant to the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. Eight genes that conferred resistance to Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis have been introduced into rice for overexpression, and transformants were evaluated for resistance to the rice bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. One of the transgenic rice lines was highly resistant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Interestingly, this line also showed remarkably high resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast, which is the most devastating rice disease in many countries. The causal rice gene, encoding a putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, was therefore designated as BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1. Our results demonstrate the utility of the rice-FOX Arabidopsis lines as a tool for the identification of genes involved in plant defence and suggest the presence of a defence mechanism common between monocots and dicots.
21390234	Gains in QTL detection using an ultra-high density SNP map based on population sequencing relative to traditional RFLP/SSR markers.	2011	PLoS One	Huge efforts have been invested in the last two decades to dissect the genetic bases of complex traits including yields of many crop plants, through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. However, almost all the studies were based on linkage maps constructed using low-throughput molecular markers, e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs), thus are mostly of low density and not able to provide precise and complete information about the numbers and locations of the genes or QTLs controlling the traits. In this study, we constructed an ultra-high density genetic map based on high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from low-coverage sequences of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of rice, generated using new sequencing technology. The quality of the map was assessed by validating the positions of several cloned genes including GS3 and GW5/qSW5, two major QTLs for grain length and grain width respectively, and OsC1, a qualitative trait locus for pigmentation. In all the cases the loci could be precisely resolved to the bins where the genes are located, indicating high quality and accuracy of the map. The SNP map was used to perform QTL analysis for yield and three yield-component traits, number of tillers per plant, number of grains per panicle and grain weight, using data from field trials conducted over years, in comparison to QTL mapping based on RFLPs/SSRs. The SNP map detected more QTLs especially for grain weight, with precise map locations, demonstrating advantages in detecting power and resolution relative to the RFLP/SSR map. Thus this study provided an example for ultra-high density map construction using sequencing technology. Moreover, the results obtained are helpful for understanding the genetic bases of the yield traits and for fine mapping and cloning of QTLs.
21444646	Genetic interaction of OsMADS3, DROOPING LEAF, and OsMADS13 in specifying rice floral organ identities and meristem determinacy.	2011	Plant Physiol	Grass plants develop unique floral patterns that determine grain production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the specification of floral organ identities and meristem determinacy, including the interaction among floral homeotic genes, remains largely unknown in grasses. Here, we report the interactions of rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic genes, OsMADS3 (a C-class gene), OsMADS13 (a D-class gene), and DROOPING LEAF (DL), in specifying floral organ identities and floral meristem determinacy. The interaction among these genes was revealed through the analysis of double mutants. osmads13-3 osmads3-4 displayed a loss of floral meristem determinacy and generated abundant carpelloid structures containing severe defective ovules in the flower center, which were not detectable in the single mutant. In addition, in situ hybridization and yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that OsMADS13 and OsMADS3 did not regulate each other's transcription or interact at the protein level. This indicates that OsMADS3 plays a synergistic role with OsMADS13 in both ovule development and floral meristem termination. Strikingly, osmads3-4 dl-sup6 displayed a severe loss of floral meristem determinacy and produced supernumerary whorls of lodicule-like organs at the forth whorl, suggesting that OsMADS3 and DL synergistically terminate the floral meristem. Furthermore, the defects of osmads13-3 dl-sup6 flowers appeared identical to those of dl-sup6, and the OsMADS13 expression was undetectable in dl-sup6 flowers. These observations suggest that DL and OsMADS13 may function in the same pathway specifying the identity of carpel/ovule and floral meristem. Collectively, we propose a model to illustrate the role of OsMADS3, DL, and OsMADS13 in the specification of flower organ identity and meristem determinacy in rice.
21679437	Meta-analysis of grain yield QTL identified during agricultural drought in grasses showed consensus.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: In the last few years, efforts have been made to identify large effect QTL for grain yield under drought in rice. However, identification of most precise and consistent QTL across the environments and genetics backgrounds is essential for their successful use in Marker-assisted Selection. In this study, an attempt was made to locate consistent QTL regions associated with yield increase under drought by applying a genome-wide QTL meta-analysis approach.

RESULTS: The integration of 15 maps resulted in a consensus map with 531 markers and a total map length of 1821 cM. Fifty-three yield QTL reported in 15 studies were projected on a consensus map and meta-analysis was performed. Fourteen meta-QTL were obtained on seven chromosomes. MQTL1.2, MQTL1.3, MQTL1.4, and MQTL12.1 were around 700 kb and corresponded to a reasonably small genetic distance of 1.8 to 5 cM and they are suitable for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). The meta-QTL for grain yield under drought coincided with at least one of the meta-QTL identified for root and leaf morphology traits under drought in earlier reports. Validation of major-effect QTL on a panel of random drought-tolerant lines revealed the presence of at least one major QTL in each line. DTY12.1 was present in 85% of the lines, followed by DTY4.1 in 79% and DTY1.1 in 64% of the lines. Comparative genomics of meta-QTL with other cereals revealed that the homologous regions of MQTL1.4 and MQTL3.2 had QTL for grain yield under drought in maize, wheat, and barley respectively. The genes in the meta-QTL regions were analyzed by a comparative genomics approach and candidate genes were deduced for grain yield under drought. Three groups of genes such as stress-inducible genes, growth and development-related genes, and sugar transport-related genes were found in clusters in most of the meta-QTL.

CONCLUSIONS: Meta-QTL with small genetic and physical intervals could be useful in Marker-assisted selection individually and in combinations. Validation and comparative genomics of the major-effect QTL confirmed their consistency within and across the species. The shortlisted candidate genes can be cloned to unravel the molecular mechanism regulating grain yield under drought.
21571948	Os-GIGANTEA confers robust diurnal rhythms on the global transcriptome of rice in the field.	2011	Plant Cell	The circadian clock controls physiological traits such as flowering time, photosynthesis, and growth in plants under laboratory conditions. Under natural field conditions, however, little is known about the significance of the circadian clock in plants. By time-course transcriptome analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves, using a newly isolated rice circadian clock-related mutant carrying a null mutation in Os-GIGANTEA (Os-GI), we show here that Os-GI controlled 75% (false discovery rate = 0.05) of genes among 27,201 genes tested and was required for strong amplitudes and fine-tuning of the diurnal rhythm phases of global gene expression in the field. However, transcripts involved in primary metabolism were not greatly affected by osgi. Time-course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected. By contrast, some transcripts and metabolites in the phenylpropanoid metabolite pathway were consistently affected. Thus, net primary assimilation of rice was still robust in the face of such osgi mutation-related circadian clock defects in the field, unlike the case with defects caused by Arabidopsis thaliana toc1 and ztl mutations in the laboratory.
21443693	Complex evolution of S5, a major reproductive barrier regulator, in the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relatives.	2011	New Phytol	• The hybrid sterility gene S5 comprises three types of alleles in cultivated rice. Such tri-allelic system provided a unique opportunity to study the molecular bases of evolutionary changes underlying reproductive isolation in plants. • We analysed the sequence diversity and evolutionary history of S5 in 138 Oryza accessions. We also examined the effect of the two functional variations (C819A and C1412T) in determining hybrid sterility by transformation. • Nineteen haplotypes were identified, which were classified into the indica-like, the japonica-like and the wide-compatibility gene (WCG)-like group, according to the sequence features of the tri-allelic system. The origin and evolutionary course of the three allelic groups were investigated, thus confirming the independent origins of indica and japonica subspecies. There were perfect associations between C819A and C1412T in the rice germplasm assayed, and the combination of C819 and C1412 was required for hybrid sterility. Evidence of positive selection in the WCG-like alleles suggested that they might have been favored by selection for higher compatibility in hybrids. • The complex evolution of S5 revealed the counteractive function of the three allelic groups at the species level. S5 might perform an important primary function in an evolutionary scale, and hybrid sterility acts as a 'byproduct' of this speciation gene.
21687735	Cloning and characterization of a putative TAC1 ortholog associated with leaf angle in maize (Zea mays L.).	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Modifying plant architecture to increase photosynthesis efficiency and reduce shade avoidance response is very important for further yield improvement when crops are grown in high density. Identification of alleles controlling leaf angle in maize is needed to provide insight into molecular mechanism of leaf development and achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The gene cloning was done by using comparative genomics, and then performing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to assay gene expression. The gene function was validated by sequence dissimilarity analysis and QTL mapping using a functional cleaved amplified polymorphism (CAP).

CONCLUSIONS: The leaf angle is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, ZmTAC1 (Zea mays L. Leaf Angle Control 1). ZmTAC1 has 4 exons encoding a protein with 263 amino acids, and its domains are the same as those of the rice OsTAC1 protein. ZmTAC1 was found to be located in the region of qLA2 by using the CAP marker and the F(2:3) families from the cross between Yu82 and Shen137. Real-time PCR analysis revealed ZmTAC1 expression was the highest in the leaf-sheath pulvinus, less in the leaf and shoot apical meristem, and the lowest in the root. A nucleotide difference in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) between the compact inbred line Yu82 ("CTCC") and the expanded inbred line Shen137 ("CCCC") influences the expression level of ZmTAC1, further controlling the size of the leaf angle. Sequence verification of the change in the 5'-UTR revealed ZmTAC1 with "CTCC" was present in 13 compact inbred lines and ZmTAC1 with "CCCC" was present in 18 expanded inbred lines, indicating ZmTAC1 had been extensively utilized in breeding with regard to the improvement of the maize plant architecture.
21715673	Investigating the contribution of the phosphate transport pathway to arsenic accumulation in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) may pose a significant health risk to consumers. Plants take up different As species using various pathways. Here, we investigated the contribution of the phosphate (Pi) transport pathway to As accumulation in rice grown hydroponically or under flooded soil conditions. In hydroponic experiments, a rice mutant defective in OsPHF1 (for phosphate transporter traffic facilitator1) lost much of the ability to take up Pi and arsenate and to transport them from roots to shoots, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing either the Pi transporter OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) or the transcription factor OsPHR2 (for phosphate starvation response2) had enhanced abilities of Pi and arsenate uptake and translocation. OsPT8 was found to have a high affinity for both Pi and arsenate, and its overexpression increased the maximum influx by 3- to 5-fold. In arsenate-treated plants, both arsenate and arsenite were detected in the xylem sap, with the proportion of the latter increasing with the exposure time. Under the flooded soil conditions, the phf1 mutant took up less Pi whereas the overexpression lines took up more Pi. But there were no similar effects on As accumulation and distribution. Rice grain contained predominantly dimethylarsinic acid and arsenite, with arsenate being a minor species. These results suggest that the Pi transport pathway contributed little to As uptake and transport to grain in rice plants grown in flooded soil. Transgenic approaches to enhance Pi acquisition from paddy soil through the overexpression of Pi transporters may not increase As accumulation in rice grain.
21497711	The physiological mechanism of a drooping leaf2 mutation in rice.	2011	Plant Sci	Here we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) drooping leaf2 mutant (named dl2). The dl2 allele affects both the midrib development and the total leaf venation pattern. Leaf anatomy results revealed the central vein lacks both clear cells and the adaxial small vascular bundle in dl2 mutant, which seemed to cause the drooping leaf phenotype. The dl2 leaves contain more small veins, and the size of the vascular cylinder in dl2 leaf is also altered. Furthermore, similar anatomy alteration was found in the dl2 roots. A reduction in the number of xylem and phloem poles in the central vascular cylinder in dl2 roots was observed and the diameter of cortical cell is also reduced. In addition, the alterations of the vegetative development such as the longer leaf blade and fewer adventitious and lateral roots were also observed in dl2. The physiological mechanism underlying the morphological and vascular alterations of dl2 was further studied. The result demonstrated that the dl2 vascular patterning distortions are strictly associated with a defective PAT (polar auxin transport) activity and sensitivity to different classes of polar auxin transport inhibitors. Finally, the drooping leaf phenotype of dl2 is coupled to a defective response to auxin.
21683590	Production of ferulic acid from lignocellulolytic agricultural biomass by Thermobifida fusca thermostable esterase produced in Yarrowia lipolytica transformant.	2011	Bioresour Technol	A gene (axe) encoding the AXE thermostable esterase in Thermobifida fusca NTU22 was cloned into a Yarrowia lipolytica P01g host strain. Recombinant expression resulted in extracellular esterase production at levels as high as 70.94 U/ml in Hinton flask culture broth, approximately 140 times higher than observed in a Pichia pastoris expression system. After 72 h of fermentation by the Y. lipolytica transformant in the fed-batch fermentor, the fermentation broth accumulated 41.11 U/ml esterase activity. Rice bran, wheat bran, bagasse and corncob were used as hydrolysis substrates for the esterase, with corncob giving the best ferulic acid yield. The corncob was incubated with T. fusca xylanase (Tfx) for 12h and then with the AXE esterase for an additional 12h. Ferulic acid accumulated to 396 μM in the culture broth, a higher concentration than with esterase alone or with Tfx and esterase together for 24 h.
21459770	Regulation of expression of starch synthesis genes by ethylene and ABA in relation to the development of rice inferior and superior spikelets.	2011	J Exp Bot	Later-flowering spikelets in a rice panicle, referred to as the inferior spikelets, are usually poorly filled and often limit the yield potential of some rice cultivars. The physiological and molecular mechanism for such poor grain filling remains unclear. In this study the differentially expressed genes in starch synthesis and hormone signalling between inferior and superior spikelets were comprehensively analysed and their relationships with grain filling was investigated. DNA microarray and real-time PCR analysis revealed that a group of starch metabolism-related genes showed enhanced expression profiles and had higher transcript levels in superior spikelets than in inferior ones at the early and middle grain-filling stages. Expression of the abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis genes, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (NCED1) and NCED5, and the ethylene synthesis genes, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 1 (ACO1) and ACO3, declined with development of the caryopses. Meanwhile, if compared with inferior spikelets, expression of these genes in superior spikelets decreased faster and had lower transcript profiles, especially for ethylene. ABA concentration and ethylene evolution rate showed similar trends to their gene expression. Exogenous supply of ABA reduced the sucrose synthase (SUS) mRNA level and its enzyme activity in detached rice grains, while exogenously supplied ethephon (an ethylene-releasing reagent) suppressed the expression of most starch synthesis genes; that is, SUS, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), and soluble starch synthase (SSS), and down-regulated their enzyme activities. In summary, it is concluded that the relatively high concentrations of ethylene and ABA in inferior spikelets suppress the expression of starch synthesis genes and their enzyme activities and consequently lead to a low grain-filling rate.
21625508	MoSfl1 is important for virulence and heat tolerance in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2011	PLoS One	The formation of appressoria, specialized plant penetration structures of Magnaporthe oryzae, is regulated by the MST11-MST7-PMK1 MAP kinase cascade. One of its downstream transcription factor, MST12, is important for penetration and invasive growth but dispensable for appressorium formation. To identify additional downstream targets that are regulated by Pmk1, in this study we performed phosphorylation assays with a protein microarray composed of 573 M. oryzae transcription factor (TF) genes. Three of the TF genes phosphorylated by Pmk1 in vitro were further analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. One of them, MoSFL1, was found to interact with Pmk1 in vivo. Like other Sfl1 orthologs, the MoSfl1 protein has the HSF-like domain. When expressed in yeast, MoSFL1 functionally complemented the flocculation defects of the sfl1 mutant. In M. oryzae, deletion of MoSFl1 resulted in a significant reduction in virulence on rice and barley seedlings. Consistent with this observation, the Mosfl1 mutant was defective in invasive growth in penetration assays with rice leaf sheaths. In comparison with that of vegetative hyphae, the expression level of MoSFL1 was increased in appressoria and infected rice leaves. The Mosfl1 mutant also had increased sensitivity to elevated temperatures. In CM cultures of the Mosfl1 and pmk1 mutants grown at 30°C, the production of aerial hyphae and melanization were reduced but their growth rate was not altered. When assayed by qRT-PCR, the transcription levels of the MoHSP30 and MoHSP98 genes were reduced 10- and 3-fold, respectively, in the Mosfl1 mutant. SFL1 orthologs are conserved in filamentous ascomycetes but none of them have been functionally characterized in non-Saccharomycetales fungi. MoSfl1 has one putative MAPK docking site and three putative MAPK phosphorylation sites. Therefore, it may be functionally related to Pmk1 in the regulation of invasive growth and stress responses in M. oryzae.
21710178	Transposition behavior of nonautonomous a hAT superfamily transposon nDart in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Transposable elements (TEs) have a significant impact on the evolution of gene function and genome structures. An endogenous nonautonomous transposable element nDart was discovered in an albino mutant that had an insertion in the Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase gene in rice. In this study, we elucidated the transposition behavior of nDart, the frequency of nDart transposition and characterized the footprint of nDart. Novel independent nDart insertions in backcrossed progenies were detected by DNA blotting analysis. In addition, germinal excision of nDart occurred at very low frequency compared with that of somatic excision, 0-13.3%, in the nDart1-4(3-2) and nDart1-A loci by a locus-specific PCR strategy. A total of 253 clones from somatic excision at five nDart loci in 10 varieties were determined. nDart rarely caused deletions beyond target site duplication (TSD). The footprint of nDart contained few transversions of nucleotides flanking to both sides of the TSD. The predominant footprint of nDart was an 8-bp addition. Precise excision of nDart was detected at a rate of only 2.2%, which occurred at two loci among the five loci examined. Furthermore, the results in this study revealed that a highly conserved mechanism of transposition is involved between maize Ac/Ds and rice Dart/nDart, which are two-component transposon systems of the hAT superfamily transposons in plant species.
21128943	The rice acyl-CoA-binding protein gene family: phylogeny, expression and functional analysis.	2011	New Phytol	• Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) show conservation in an acyl-CoA-binding domain (ACB domain) which binds acyl-CoA esters. Previous studies on plant ACBPs focused on eudicots, Arabidopsis and Brassica. Here, we report on the phylogeny and characterization of the ACBP family from the monocot Oryza sativa (rice). • Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using 16 plant genomes. Expression profiles of rice ACBPs under normal growth, as well as biotic and abiotic stress conditions, were examined by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions. In vitro acyl-CoA-binding assays were conducted using recombinant (His)₆-tagged ACBPs. • The ACBP family diversified as land plants evolved. Classes I and IV show lineage-specific gene expansion. Classes II and III are closely related phylogenetically. As in the eudicot Arabidopsis, six genes (designated OsACBP1 to OsACBP6) encode rice ACBPs, but their distribution into various classes differed from Arabidopsis. Rice ACBP mRNAs showed ubiquitous expression and OsACBP4, OsACBP5 and OsACBP6 were stress-responsive. All recombinant rice ACBPs bind [¹⁴C]linolenoyl-CoA besides having specific substrates. • Phylogeny, gene expression and biochemical analyses suggest that paralogues within and across classes are not redundant proteins. In addition to performing conserved basal functions, multidomain rice ACBPs appear to be associated with stress responses.
20955181	OsCD1 encodes a putative member of the cellulose synthase-like D sub-family and is essential for rice plant architecture and growth.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	The cell wall plays important roles in plant architecture and morphogenesis. The cellulose synthase-like super-families were reported to contain glycosyltransferases motif and are required for the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. Here, we describe a curled leaf and dwarf mutant, cd1, in rice, which exhibits multiple phenotypic traits such as the reduction of plant height and leaf width, curled leaf morphology and a decrease in the number of grains and in the panicle length. Map-based cloning indicates that a member of the cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) group is a candidate for OsCD1. RNAi transgenic plants with the candidate CSLD gene display a similar phenotype to the cd1 mutant, suggesting that OsCD1 is a member of the CSLD sub-family. Furthermore, sequence analysis indicates that OsCD1 contains the common D,D,D,QXXRW motif, which is a feature of the cellulose synthase-like super-family. Analysis of OsCD1 promoter with GUS fusion expression shows that OsCD1 exhibits higher expression in young meristem tissues such as fresh roots, young panicle and stem apical meristem. Cell wall composition analysis reveals that cellulose content and the level of xylose are significantly reduced in mature culm owing to loss of OsCD1 function. Take together, the work presented here is useful for expanding the understanding of cell wall biosynthesis.
21624033	Introduction of the ZmDof1 gene into rice enhances carbon and nitrogen assimilation under low-nitrogen conditions.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	The excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer to maximize crop yields causes negative environmental effects such as pollution and ecological imbalance. To overcome this problem, researchers have attempted to improve the nitrogen assimilation capacity of crops. Maize Dof1 (ZmDof1) is a plant-specific transcription factor shown to promote nitrogen assimilation in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) even under nitrogen-deficient conditions. The present study examines the effect of the introduction of the ZmDof1 gene on carbon and nitrogen assimilation in rice. ZmDof1 induced the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) genes in transgenic rice plants and transactivated the PEPC promoters in protoplast transient assays, showing similar effects in rice as in Arabidopsis. Transgenic rice expressing ZmDof1 and grown in the presence of 360 μm (nitrogen-sufficient) or 90 μm (nitrogen-deficient) of nitrogen concentrations showed modulation of metabolite content and gene expression associated with the anaplerotic pathway for the TCA cycle, suggesting an increased carbon flow towards nitrogen assimilation. Furthermore, increases in carbon and nitrogen amounts per seedling were found in Dof1 rice grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions. Nitrogen deficiency also resulted in the predominant distribution of nitrogen to roots, accompanied by significant increases in root biomass and modification of the shoot-to-root ratio. Measurement of the CO₂ gas exchange rate showed a significant increase in the net photosynthesis rate in Dof1 rice under nitrogen-deficient conditions. Taken these together, the present study displayed that ZmDof1 expression in rice could induce gene expressions such as PEPC genes, modulate carbon and nitrogen metabolites, increase nitrogen assimilation and enhance growth under low-nitrogen conditions.
21698458	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2011	Planta	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
21082325	Molecular analysis of an additional case of hybrid sterility in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Planta	Hybrid sterility hinders the exploitation of the heterosis displayed by japonica × indica rice hybrids. The variation in pollen semi-sterility observed among hybrids between the japonica recipient cultivar and each of two sets of chromosome segment substitution lines involving introgression from an indica cultivar was due to a factor on chromosome 5 known to harbor the gene S24. S24 was fine mapped to a 42 kb segment by analyzing a large F(2) population bred from the cross S24-NIL × Asominori, while the semi-sterility shown by the F(1) hybrid was ascribable to mitotic failure at the early bicellular pollen stage. Interestingly, two other pollen sterility genes (f5-Du and Sb) map to the same region (Li et al. in Chin Sci Bull 51:675-680, 2006; Wang et al. in Theor Appl Genet 112:382-387, 2006), allowing a search for candidate genes in the 6.4 kb overlap between the three genes. By sequencing the overlapped fragment in wild rice, indica cultivars and japonica cultivars, a protein ankyrin-3 encoded by the ORF2 was identified as the molecular base for S24. A cultivar Dular was found to have a hybrid-sterility-neutral allele, S24-n, in which an insertion of 30 bp was confirmed. Thus, it was possible to add one more case of molecular bases for the hybrid sterility. No gamete abortion is caused on heterozygous maternal genotype with an impaired sequence from the hybrid-sterility-neutral genotype. This result will be useful in understanding of wide compatibility in rice breeding.
21543899	Phylogenetic analysis of GRAS proteins from moss, lycophyte and vascular plant lineages reveals that GRAS genes arose and underwent substantial diversification in the ancestral lineage common to bryophytes and vascular plants.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	GRAS genes are a large family of streptophyte specific transcription factors that function in a diverse set of physiological and developmental processes. GRAS proteins of the HAIRY MERISTEM (HAM) sub-family are required for maintenance of shoot and root indeterminacy. The transcriptional targets of HAM proteins and the signaling inputs regulating HAM activity are completely unknown. Understanding the relationship of HAM proteins to other members of the GRAS family may inform hypotheses relating to cellular level HAM functions. I here report a phylogenetic analysis of GRAS proteins employing the complete set of known and probable GRAS proteins from the sequenced genomes of the flowering plants Arabidopsis and Rice, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, and the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. HAM proteins are most closely related to DELLA proteins, key components of gibberellin perception. However, GRAS proteins diversified into a minimum of twelve discreet monophyletic lineages, including the HAM and DELLA subfamilies, prior to divergence of the moss and flowering plant lineages. Substantial diversification of GRAS proteins at so early a point in land plant evolution suggests that relative relatedness sequence homology among GRAS proteins sub-families may not substantially reflect shared protein function.
21594748	Evolutionary history of the GH3 family of acyl adenylases in rosids.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	GH3 amino acid conjugases have been identified in many plant and bacterial species. The evolution of GH3 genes in plant species is explored using the sequenced rosids Arabidopsis, papaya, poplar, and grape. Analysis of the sequenced non-rosid eudicots monkey flower and columbine, the monocots maize and rice, as well as spikemoss and moss is included to provide further insight into the origin of GH3 clades. Comparison of co-linear genes in regions surrounding GH3 genes between species helps reconstruct the evolutionary history of the family. Combining analysis of synteny with phylogenetics, gene expression and functional data redefines the Group III GH3 genes, of which AtGH3.12/PBS3, a regulator of stress-induced salicylic acid metabolism and plant defense, is a member. Contrary to previous reports that restrict PBS3 to Arabidopsis and its close relatives, PBS3 syntelogs are identified in poplar, grape, columbine, maize and rice suggesting descent from a common ancestral chromosome dating to before the eudicot/monocot split. In addition, the clade containing PBS3 has undergone a unique expansion in Arabidopsis, with expression patterns for these genes consistent with specialized and evolving stress-responsive functions.
21492454	Deep sequencing reveals the complex and coordinated transcriptional regulation of genes related to grain quality in rice cultivars.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Milling yield and eating quality are two important grain quality traits in rice. To identify the genes involved in these two traits, we performed a deep transcriptional analysis of developing seeds using both massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS). Five MPSS and five SBS libraries were constructed from 6-day-old developing seeds of Cypress (high milling yield), LaGrue (low milling yield), Ilpumbyeo (high eating quality), YR15965 (low eating quality), and Nipponbare (control).

RESULTS: The transcriptomes revealed by MPSS and SBS had a high correlation co-efficient (0.81 to 0.90), and about 70% of the transcripts were commonly identified in both types of the libraries. SBS, however, identified 30% more transcripts than MPSS. Among the highly expressed genes in Cypress and Ilpumbyeo, over 100 conserved cis regulatory elements were identified. Numerous specifically expressed transcription factor (TF) genes were identified in Cypress (282), LaGrue (312), Ilpumbyeo (363), YR15965 (260), and Nipponbare (357). Many key grain quality-related genes (i.e., genes involved in starch metabolism, aspartate amino acid metabolism, storage and allergenic protein synthesis, and seed maturation) that were expressed at high levels underwent alternative splicing and produced antisense transcripts either in Cypress or Ilpumbyeo. Further, a time course RT-PCR analysis confirmed a higher expression level of genes involved in starch metabolism such as those encoding ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and granule bound starch synthase I (GBSS I) in Cypress than that in LaGrue during early seed development.

CONCLUSION: This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the developing seed transcriptome of rice available to date. Using two high throughput sequencing methods, we identified many differentially expressed genes that may affect milling yield or eating quality in rice. Many of the identified genes are involved in the biosynthesis of starch, aspartate family amino acids, and storage proteins. Some of the differentially expressed genes could be useful for the development of molecular markers if they are located in a known QTL region for milling yield or eating quality in the rice genome. Therefore, our comprehensive and deep survey of the developing seed transcriptome in five rice cultivars has provided a rich genomic resource for further elucidating the molecular basis of grain quality in rice.
21615569	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis.	2011	Plant J	Shugoshin is a conserved protein in eukaryotes that protects the centromeric cohesin of sister chromatids from cleavage by separase during meiosis. In this study, we identify the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n=2x=24) homolog of ZmSGO1 in maize (Zea mays), named OsSGO1. During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase. In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II. Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis. Furthermore, the timely assembly and maintenance of synaptonemal complexes during early prophase I are affected in Ossgo1 mutants. Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1.
21457373	Two Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, CYP714A1 and CYP714A2, function redundantly in plant development through gibberellin deactivation.	2011	Plant J	The rice gene ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (EUI1) encodes a P450 monooxygenase that epoxidizes gibberellins (GAs) in a deactivation reaction. The Arabidopsis genome contains a tandemly duplicated gene pair ELA1 (CYP714A1) and ELA2 (CYP714A2) that encode EUI homologs. In this work, we dissected the functions of the two proteins. ELA1 and ELA2 exhibited overlapping yet distinct gene expression patterns. We showed that while single mutants of ELA1 or ELA2 exhibited no obvious morphological phenotype, simultaneous elimination of ELA1 and ELA2 expression in ELA1-RNAi/ela2 resulted in increased biomass and enlarged organs. By contrast, transgenic plants constitutively expressing either ELA1 or ELA2 were dwarfed, similar to those overexpressing the rice EUI gene. We also discovered that overexpression of ELA1 resulted in a severe dwarf phenotype, while overexpression of ELA2 gave rise to a breeding-favored semi-dwarf phenotype in rice. Consistent with the phenotypes, we found that the ELA1-RNAi/ela2 plants increased amounts of biologically active GAs that were decreased in the internodes of transgenic rice with ELA1 and ELA2 overexpression. In contrast, the precursor GA(12) slightly accumulated in the transgenic rice, and GA(19) highly accumulated in the ELA2 overexpression rice. Taken together, our study strongly suggests that the two Arabidopsis EUI homologs subtly regulate plant growth most likely through catalyzing deactivation of bioactive GAs similar to rice EUI. The two P450s may also function in early stages of the GA biosynthetic pathway. Our results also suggest that ELA2 could be an excellent tool for molecular breeding for high yield potential in cereal crops.
21459832	Overexpression of TaNAC69 leads to enhanced transcript levels of stress up-regulated genes and dehydration tolerance in bread wheat.	2011	Mol Plant	NAC proteins are plant-specific transcription factors and enriched with members involved in plant response to drought stress. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of TaNAC69 in bread wheat using Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array datasets and quantitative RT-PCR. TaNAC69 expression was positively associated with wheat responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses and was closely correlated with a number of stress up-regulated genes. The functional analyses of TaNAC69 in transgenic wheat showed that TaNAC69 driven by a barley drought-inducible HvDhn4s promoter led to marked drought-inducible overexpression of TaNAC69 in the leaves and roots of transgenic lines. The HvDhn4s:TaNAC69 transgenic lines produced more shoot biomass under combined mild salt stress and water-limitation conditions, had longer root and more root biomass under polyethylene glycol-induced dehydration. Analysis of transgenic lines with constitutive overexpression of TaNAC69 showed the enhanced expression levels of several stress up-regulated genes. DNA-binding assays revealed that TaNAC69 and its rice homolog (ONAC131) were capable of binding to the promoter elements of three rice genes (chitinase, ZIM, and glyoxalase I) and an Arabidopsis glyoxalase I family gene, which are homologs of TaNAC69 up-regulated stress genes. These data suggest that TaNAC69 is involved in regulating stress up-regulated genes and wheat adaptation to drought stress.
21619871	OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 are jasmonyl-L-isoleucine synthases involved in wound- and pathogen-induced jasmonic acid signalling.	2011	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The synthesis of JA-Ile was catalysed by JA-Ile synthase, which is a member of the group I GH3 family of proteins. Here, we showed evidence that OsGH3.5 (OsJAR1) and OsGH3.3 (OsJAR2) are the functional JA-Ile synthases in rice, using recombinant proteins. The expression levels of OsJAR1 and OsJAR2 were induced in response to wounding with the concomitant accumulation of JA-Ile. In contrast, only the expression of OsJAR1 was associated with the accumulation of JA-Ile after blast infection. Our data suggest that these two JA-Ile synthases are differentially involved in the activation of JA signalling in response to wounding and pathogen challenge in rice.
21418352	Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, NLS1, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice.	2011	Plant J	In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant nls1-1D (necrotic leaf sheath 1) of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern. nls1-1D plants also exhibited constitutively activated defense responses, including extensive cell death, excess hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, up-regulated expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens. Map-based cloning revealed that NLS1 encodes a typical CC-NB-LRR-type protein in rice. The nls1-1D mutation causes a S367N substitution in the non-conserved region close to the GLPL motif of the NB domain. An adjacent S366T substitution was found in another semi-dominant mutant, nls1-2D, which exhibited the same phenotypes as nls1-1D. Combined analyses of wild-type plants transformed with the mutant NLS1 gene (nls1-1D), NLS1 RNAi and over-expression transgenic lines showed that nls1-2D is allelic to nls1-1D, and both mutations may cause constitutive auto-activation of the NLS1 R protein. Further real-time PCR analysis revealed that NLS1 is expressed constitutively in an age-dependent manner. In addition, because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of nls1-1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that NLS1 mediates both SA and NPR1-independent defense signaling pathways in rice.
21406116	Genome-wide temporal-spatial gene expression profiling of drought responsiveness in rice.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice is highly sensitive to drought, and the effect of drought may vary with the different genotypes and development stages. Genome-wide gene expression profiling was used as the initial point to dissect molecular genetic mechanism of this complex trait and provide valuable information for the improvement of drought tolerance in rice. Affymetrix rice genome array containing 48,564 japonica and 1,260 indica sequences was used to analyze the gene expression pattern of rice exposed to drought stress. The transcriptome from leaf, root, and young panicle at three developmental stages was comparatively analyzed combined with bioinformatics exploring drought stress related cis-elements.

RESULTS: There were 5,284 genes detected to be differentially expressed under drought stress. Most of these genes were tissue- or stage-specific regulated by drought. The tissue-specific down-regulated genes showed distinct function categories as photosynthesis-related genes prevalent in leaf, and the genes involved in cell membrane biogenesis and cell wall modification over-presented in root and young panicle. In a drought environment, several genes, such as GA2ox, SAP15, and Chitinase III, were regulated in a reciprocal way in two tissues at the same development stage. A total of 261 transcription factor genes were detected to be differentially regulated by drought stress. Most of them were also regulated in a tissue- or stage-specific manner. A cis-element containing special CGCG box was identified to over-present in the upstream of 55 common induced genes, and it may be very important for rice plants responding to drought environment.

CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide gene expression profiling revealed that most of the drought differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were under temporal and spatial regulation, suggesting a crosstalk between various development cues and environmental stimuli. The identification of the differentially regulated DEGs, including TF genes and unique candidate cis-element for drought responsiveness, is a very useful resource for the functional dissection of the molecular mechanism in rice responding to environment stress.
21546455	Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the expression of ABRE-containing genes.	2011	Plant Physiol	Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant development and is crucial for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Studies have identified the key components of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), some of which regulate ABA responses by the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes. Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 (ABL1), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor. ABL1 is expressed in various tissues and is induced by the hormones ABA and indole-3-acetic acid and stress conditions including salinity, drought, and osmotic pressure. The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity. The ABL1 protein is localized to the nucleus and can directly bind ABA-responsive elements (ABREs; G-box) in vitro. A gene expression analysis by DNA chip hybridization confirms that a large proportion of down-regulated genes of abl1 are involved in stress responses, consistent with the transcriptional activating effects of ABL1. Further studies indicate that ABL1 regulates the plant stress responses by regulating a series of ABRE-containing WRKY family genes. In addition, the abl1 mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous indole-3-acetic acid, and some ABRE-containing genes related to auxin metabolism or signaling are altered under ABL1 deficiency, suggesting that ABL1 modulates ABA and auxin responses by directly regulating the ABRE-containing genes.
21424397	High-resolution mapping of Rsn1, a locus controlling sensitivity of rice to a necrosis-inducing phytotoxin from Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rhizoctonia solani is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes disease on many crop-plant species. Anastomosis group 1-IA is the causal agent of sheath blight of rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important rice diseases worldwide. R. solani AG1-IA produces a necrosis-inducing phytotoxin and rice cultivar's sensitivity to the toxin correlates with disease susceptibility. Unlike genetic analyses of sheath blight resistance where resistance loci have been reported as quantitative trait loci, phytotoxin sensitivity is inherited as a Mendelian trait that permits high-resolution mapping of the sensitivity genes. An F(2) mapping population derived from parent cultivars 'Cypress' (toxin sensitive) and 'Jasmine 85' (toxin insensitive) was used to map Rsn1, the necrosis-inducing locus. Initial mapping based on 176 F(2) progeny and 69 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers located Rsn1 on the long arm of chromosome 7, with tight linkage to SSR marker RM418. A high-resolution genetic map of the region was subsequently developed using a total of 1,043 F(2) progeny, and Rsn1 was mapped to a 0.7 cM interval flanked by markers NM590 and RM418. Analysis of the corresponding 29 Kb genomic sequences from reference cultivars 'Nipponbare' and '93-11' revealed the presence of four putative genes within the interval. Two are expressed cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferases, which fit an apoptotic pathway model of toxin activity, and are individually being investigated further as potential candidates for Rsn1.
21512773	Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with germination using chromosome segment substitution lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rapid and uniform seed germination under diverse environmental conditions is a desirable characteristic for most crop plants, such as rice, wheat, and maize. However, the genetic base of the variations in the rate of germination is not well understood. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for germination rate were mapped with a set of 143 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) each contains a small genomic fragment from a japonica variety Nipponbare in the uniform genetic background of an indica variety Zhenshan97. Nine CSSL showed significantly lower germination rate than that in Zhenshan97. Four germination-related QTL were identified located on chromosomes 2, 5, 6 and 10, at which all japonica alleles decreased germination rate. By using the CSSL-derived F2 population, a major QTL (qGR2) on chromosome 2 was confirmed, and delimited to a 10.4 kb interval containing three putative candidate genes, of which OsMADS29 was only expressed preferentially in the seed. These results would facilitate cloning of the major gene that affects germination rate, and provide an insight into the genetic basis of germination.
21409497	A novel endosperm transfer cell-containing region-specific gene and its promoter in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	The endosperm of cereal grains is an important resource for both food and feed. It contains three major types of tissue: starchy endosperm, the aleurone layer, and transfer cells. To improve grain quality and quantity using molecular methods, control of transgene expression directed by distinct temporal and spatial promoter activity is necessary. To identify aleurone layer-specific and/or transfer cell-specific promoters in rice, microarray analyses were performed, comparing the aleurone layer containing transfer cells and the other reproductive and vegetative tissues. After confirmation by RT-PCR analysis, we identified two putative aleurone layer and/or transfer cell-specific genes, AL1 and AL2. The promoter regions of these genes and β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs were stably transformed into rice. The GUS expression patterns indicated that the AL1 promoter was active exclusively in the dorsal aleurone layer adjacent to the main vascular bundle. In rice, transfer cells are differentiated in this region. Therefore, the promoter of the AL1 gene exhibits transfer cell-containing region-specific activity. The AL1 gene encodes a putative anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase. The promoter of this gene will be useful for enhancing uptake of nutrients from the mother cells and protecting filial seeds from pathogen attack.
21683874	Aberrant vegetative and reproductive development by overexpression and lethality by silencing of OsHAP3E in rice.	2011	Plant Sci	We generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHAP3E which encodes a subunit of a CCAAT-motif binding HAP complex. The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants showed various abnormal morphologies both in their vegetative and reproductive phases. The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase. In the reproductive phase, dense panicle was developed, and occasionally successive generation of lateral rachises and formation of double flowers were observed. These phenotypes indicate association of OsHAP3E with determination of floral meristem identity. On the other hand, repression of OsHAP3E by RNAi or by overexpressing chimeric repressor fusion constructs brought about lethality to transformed cells, and almost no transformant was obtained. This suggests that the OsHAP3E function is essential for rice cells. Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice.
21640170	Genome-wide identification of gibberellins metabolic enzyme genes and expression profiling analysis during seed germination in maize.	2011	Gene	Gibberellin (GA) is an essential phytohormone that controls many aspects of plant development. To enhance our understanding of GA metabolism in maize, we intensively screened and identified 27 candidate genes encoding the seven GA metabolic enzymes including ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox), using all available public maize databases. The results indicate that maize genome contains three CPS, four KS, two KO and one KAO genes, and most of them are arranged separately on the maize genome, which differs from that in rice. In addition, the enzymes catalyzing the later steps (ZmGA20ox, ZmGA3ox and ZmGA2ox) are also encoded by gene families in maize, but GA3ox enzyme is likely to be encoded by single gene. Expression profiling analysis exhibited that transcripts of 15 GA metabolic genes could be detected during maize seed germination, which provides further evidence for the notion that increased synthesis of active GA in the embryo is required for triggering germination events. Moreover, a variety of temporal genes expression patterns of GA metabolic genes were detected, which revealed the complexity of underlying mechanism for GA regulated seed germination.
21203887	Enhanced chilling tolerance at the booting stage in rice by transgenic overexpression of the ascorbate peroxidase gene, OsAPXa.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Low temperatures during the booting stage reduce rice yields by causing cold-induced male sterility. To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity. The effect of increased APX activity on the levels of H(2)O(2) and lipid peroxidation were determined by measuring H(2)O(2) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in spikelets during cold treatments at the booting stage. The levels of H(2)O(2) and the MDA content increased by 1.5-fold and twofold, respectively in WT plants subjected to a 12 °C treatment for 6 days. In contrast, transgenic lines showed small changes in H(2)O(2) levels and MDA content under cold stress, and H(2)O(2) levels and MDA content were significantly lower than in WT plants. APX activity showed negative correlations with levels of H(2)O(2) and MDA content, which increased during cold treatment. Cold tolerance at the booting stage in transgenic lines and WT plants was evaluated. Spikelet fertility was significantly higher in transgenic lines than in WT plants after a 12 °C treatment for 6 days. These results indicate that higher APX activity enhances H(2)O(2)-scavenging capacity and protects spikelets from lipid peroxidation, thereby increasing spikelet fertility under cold stress.
21565907	Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Although flowering time is often associated with plant size, little is known about how flowering time genes affect plant architecture. We grew four rice lines having different flowering time genotypes (hd1 ehd1, hd1 Ehd1, Hd1 ehd1 and Hd1 Ehd1) under distinct photoperiod conditions. By using genotype-treatment combinations that resulted in similar flowering times, we were able to compare the effects of flowering time genes on traits related to plant architecture. The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time. In addition, expression of the Hd3a and Rice Flowering-locus T 1 (RFT1) florigen genes was up-regulated in leaves of the Hd1 Ehd1 line at the time of the floral transition. We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development. Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf.
21208999	Characterization of Xanthomonas oryzae-responsive cis-acting element in the promoter of rice race-specific susceptibility gene Xa13.	2011	Mol Plant	The rice Xa13 gene, whose promoter harbors a UPT (up-regulated by transcription activator-like [TAL] effector) box, UPT(PthXo1), plays a pivotal role in the race-specific pathogenicity caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strain PXO99. PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing Xa13. It is unknown, however, whether the UPT(PthXo1) box is the only PXO99-responsive cis-regulating elements in the activation of Xa13 expression. We analyzed the expression of a series of end- and site-truncated and site-mutated Xa13 promoters in rice and the binding of PXO99 protein to the intact, partial, or site-mutated UPT(PthXo1) boxes. In the Xa13 promoter, UPT(PthXo1) box is the only Xoo-responsive cis-acting element that results in PXO99-induced Xa13 expression. The 5'-terminal second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the box are important for bacterial protein binding and gene activation; mutation of any one of these sites abolished PXO99-induced gene expression. Furthermore, the 3'-half of the UPT(PthXo1) box is also required for protein binding and gene activation. These findings will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the interaction of rice and Xoo via UPT boxes and TAL effectors.
21681490	Evaluation of near-isogenic lines for drought resistance QTL and fine mapping of a locus affecting flag leaf width, spikelet number, and root volume in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Drought stress is a major limiting factor for crop production and breeding for drought resistance is very challenging due to the complex nature of this trait. Previous studies in rice suggest that the upland japonica variety IRAT109 shows better drought resistance than the lowland indica variety Zhenshan 97. Numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been previously mapped using a recombinant inbred line population derived from these two genotypes. In this study, near-isogenic lines (NILs) for 17 drought resistance-related QTL were constructed and phenotypic variations of these NILs were investigated under drought and normal conditions. Fourteen of these NILs showed significant phenotypic differences relative to the recurrent parent under at least one of the conditions and nine NILs showed significant differences under both conditions. After eliminating the effect of heading date on drought resistance, only four NILs carrying seven QTL (four for the same grain yield-related traits and three for the same or similar root traits QTL) showed differences consistent with the original QTL mapping results. One of these lines (N19) contains qFSR4, a QTL on chromosome 4 controlling root volume per tiller and co-segregating with flag leaf width and spikelet number per panicle. Using a population derived from N19, qFSR4 was mapped to a 38-kb region containing three open reading frames including the previously characterized NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1) gene. NAL1, which controls leaf width and also affects vein patterning and polar auxin transport, is the most promising candidate genes for qFSR4. Our results underscore the importance of the development of NILs to confirm the identification of QTL affecting complex traits such as drought resistance.
21551159	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Debranching enzymes, which hydrolyze α-1 and 6-glucosidic linkages in α-polyglucans, play a dual role in the synthesis and degradation of starch in plants. A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night. An epitope-tagged ISA3 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited hydrolytic activity on β-limit dextrin and amylopectin. We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm. ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm. Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant. Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules. Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic. These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice.
21613379	Reduced expression of a gene encoding a Golgi localized monosaccharide transporter (OsGMST1) confers hypersensitivity to salt in rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	J Exp Bot	Sugar transport is critical for normal plant development and stress responses. However, functional evidence for the roles of monosaccharide transporters in rice (Oryza sativa) has not previously been presented. In this study, reversed genetics was used to identify OsGMST1 as a member of the monosaccharide transporter family in rice. The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST1 expression. OsGMST1-green fluorescent protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus. OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice. OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice.
21576467	The Arabidopsis flagellin receptor FLS2 mediates the perception of Xanthomonas Ax21 secreted peptides.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Detection of microbes by plants relies in part on an array of pattern-recognition receptors that recognize conserved microbial signatures, so-called "microbe-associated molecular patterns." The Arabidopsis thaliana receptor-like kinase FLS2 is the pattern-recognition receptor for bacterial flagellin. Similarly to FLS2, the rice transmembrane protein XA21 is the receptor for the sulfated form of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae secreted protein Ax21. Here we show that Ax21-derived peptides activate Arabidopsis immunity, triggering responses similar to those elicited by flagellin, including an oxidative burst, induction of defense-response genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens. To identify Arabidopsis Xa21 functional homologs, we used a reverse genetics approach to screen T-DNA insertion mutants corresponding to all 47 of the Arabidopsis genes encoding non-RD kinases belonging to the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Surprisingly, among all of these mutant lines, only fls2 mutants exhibited a significant loss of response to Ax21-derived peptides. Ax21 peptides also failed to activate defense-related responses in an fls2-24 mutant that does not bind Flg22. Moreover, a Flg22Δ2 variant of Flg22 that binds to FLS2 but does not activate FLS2-mediated signaling suppressed Ax21-derived peptide signaling, indicating mutually exclusive perception of Flg22 or Ax21 peptides by FLS2. The data indicate that FLS2 functions beyond flagellin perception to detect other microbe-associated molecular patterns.
21543724	Suppression of a NAC-like transcription factor gene improves boron-toxicity tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	We identified a gene responsible for tolerance to boron (B) toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa), named BORON EXCESS TOLERANT1. Using recombinant inbred lines derived from the B-toxicity-sensitive indica-ecotype cultivar IR36 and the tolerant japonica-ecotype cultivar Nekken 1, the region responsible for tolerance to B toxicity was narrowed to 49 kb on chromosome 4. Eight genes are annotated in this region. The DNA sequence in this region was compared between the B-toxicity-sensitive japonica cultivar Wataribune and the B-toxicity-tolerant japonica cultivar Nipponbare by eco-TILLING analysis and revealed a one-base insertion mutation in the open reading frame sequence of the gene Os04g0477300. The gene encodes a NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC)-like transcription factor and the function of the transcript is abolished in B-toxicity-tolerant cultivars. Transgenic plants in which the expression of Os04g0477300 is abolished by RNA interference gain tolerance to B toxicity.
21534973	Rice A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress-associated proteins (SAP1/11) and a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (OsRLCK253) interact via A20 zinc-finger and confer abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2011	New Phytol	• The inbuilt mechanisms of plant survival have been exploited for improving tolerance to abiotic stresses. Stress-associated proteins (SAPs), containing A20/AN1 zinc-finger domains, confer abiotic stress tolerance in different plants, however, their interacting partners and downstream targets remain to be identified. • In this study, we have investigated the subcellular interactions of rice SAPs and their interacting partner using yeast two-hybrid and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approaches. Their efficacy in improving abiotic stress tolerance was analysed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Regulation of gene expression by genome-wide microarray in transgenics was used to identify downstream targets. • It was found that the A20 domain mediates the interaction of OsSAP1 with self, its close homolog OsSAP11 and a rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK253. Such interactions between OsSAP1/11 and with OsRLCK253 occur at nuclear membrane, plasma membrane and in nucleus. Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes. • Components of a novel stress-responsive pathway have been identified. Their stress-inducible expression provided the protection against yield loss in transgenic plants, indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance.
21383162	Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Golgi-localized nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) are considered essential for the biosynthesis of wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins based on their characteristic transport of a large number of nucleotide sugars to the Golgi lumen. The lack of NST mutants in plants has prevented evaluation of this hypothesis in plants. A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development. Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter1 (OsNST1). OsNST1 was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged OsNST1 expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast. Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis. OsNST1 is ubiquitously expressed, with high expression in mechanical tissues. The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth. Identification of OsNST1 has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants.
21371040	Vacuolar two-pore K+ channels act as vacuolar osmosensors.	2011	New Phytol	• Plant two-pore K(+) channels (TPKs) have been shown previously to play a role in vacuolar K(+) homeostasis. TPK activity is insensitive to membrane voltage, but regulated by cytoplasmic calcium and 14-3-3 proteins. This study reports that membrane stretch and osmotic gradients also alter the activity of TPKs from Arabidopsis, rice and barley, and that this may have a physiological relevance for osmotic homeostasis. • Mechanosensitivity was studied using patch clamp experiments and TPKs from Arabidopsis, rice and barley. In addition, the capability of TPKs to act as osmosensors was determined. By using protoplast disruption assays and intact plant survival assays, in genotypes that differed in TPK expression, the physiological relevance of TPK-based osmosensing was tested. • TPKs from all three species showed varying degrees of mechanosensitivity. TPK activity in channels from all three species was sensitive to trans-tonoplast osmotic gradients. TPK osmosensing is likely to proceed via the detection of small perturbations in membrane tension. Intact plant and protoplast assays showed that TPK-based osmosensing is important during exposure to rapid changes in external osmolarity. • Vacuolar TPK channels can act as intracellular osmosensors and rapidly increase channel activity during hypo-osmotic shock to release vacuolar K(+) .
21646530	Artificial selection for a green revolution gene during japonica rice domestication.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The semidwarf phenotype has been extensively selected during modern crop breeding as an agronomically important trait. Introduction of the semidwarf gene, semi-dwarf1 (sd1), which encodes a gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, made significant contributions to the "green revolution" in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here we report that SD1 was involved not only in modern breeding including the green revolution, but also in early steps of rice domestication. We identified two SNPs in O. sativa subspecies (ssp.) japonica SD1 as functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) responsible for shorter culm length and low gibberellin biosynthetic activity. Genetic diversity analysis among O. sativa ssp. japonica and indica, along with their wild ancestor O. rufipogon Griff, revealed that these FNPs clearly differentiate the japonica landrace and O. rufipogon. We also found a dramatic reduction in nucleotide diversity around SD1 only in the japonica landrace, not in the indica landrace or O. rufipogon. These findings indicate that SD1 has been subjected to artificial selection in rice evolution and that the FNPs participated in japonica domestication, suggesting that ancient humans already used the green revolution gene.
21322560	Functional proteomic analysis of rice bran esterases/lipases and characterization of a novel recombinant esterase.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	An esterase from rice ( Oryza sativa ) bran was identified on two-dimensional gel using 4-methylumbelliferyl butyrate as a substrate. The esterase cDNA (870 bp) encoded a 289 amino acid protein (designated OsEST-b) and was expressed in Escherichia coli . The molecular weight of recombinant OsEST-b (rOsEST-b) was 27 kDa, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that rOsEST-b was active over a broad temperature range (optimum at 60 °C) and preferred alkaline conditions (optimum at pH 9.0). The rOsEST-b showed maximum activity toward p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C(4)) among various p-nitrophenyl esters (C(4)-C(18)), indicating that rOsEST-b is an esterase for short-chain fatty acids. The kinetic parameters under optimal conditions were K(m) = 27.03 μM, k(cat) = 49 s(-1), and k(cat)/K(m) = 1.81 s(-1) μM(-1). The activity of rOsEST-b was not influenced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that it is not a metalloenzyme. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that OsEST-b had a conserved pentapeptide esterase/lipase motif but that the essential active site serine (GXSXG) was replaced by cysteine (C). These results suggest that OsEST-b is distinct from traditional esterases/lipases and is a novel lipolytic enzyme in rice bran.
21711449	ALK, the key gene for gelatinization temperature, is a modifier gene for gel consistency in rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Gelatinization temperature (GT) is an important parameter in evaluating the cooking and eating quality of rice. Indeed, the phenotype, biochemistry and inheritance of GT have been widely studied in recent times. Previous map-based cloning revealed that GT was controlled by ALK gene, which encodes a putative soluble starch synthase II-3. Complementation vector and RNAi vector were constructed and transformed into Nipponbare mediated by Agrobacterium. Phenotypic and molecular analyses of transgenic lines provided direct evidence for ALK as a key gene for GT. Meanwhile, amylose content, gel consistency and pasting properties were also affected in transgenic lines. Two of four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in coding sequence of ALK were identified as essential for GT. Based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two new sets of SNP markers combined with one cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker were developed for application in rice quality breeding.
21473768	Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of auxin response factor (ARF) gene family in maize.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Auxin signaling is vital for plant growth and development, and plays important role in apical dominance, tropic response, lateral root formation, vascular differentiation, embryo patterning and shoot elongation. Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) are the transcription factors that regulate the expression of auxin responsive genes. The ARF genes are represented by a large multigene family in plants. The first draft of full maize genome assembly has recently been released, however, to our knowledge, the ARF gene family from maize (ZmARF genes) has not been characterized in detail.

RESULTS: In this study, 31 maize (Zea mays L.) genes that encode ARF proteins were identified in maize genome. It was shown that maize ARF genes fall into related sister pairs and chromosomal mapping revealed that duplication of ZmARFs was associated with the chromosomal block duplications. As expected, duplication of some ZmARFs showed a conserved intron/exon structure, whereas some others were more divergent, suggesting the possibility of functional diversification for these genes. Out of these 31 ZmARF genes, 14 possess auxin-responsive element in their promoter region, among which 7 appear to show small or negligible response to exogenous auxin. The 18 ZmARF genes were predicted to be the potential targets of small RNAs. Transgenic analysis revealed that increased miR167 level could cause degradation of transcripts of six potential targets (ZmARF3, 9, 16, 18, 22 and 30). The expressions of maize ARF genes are responsive to exogenous auxin treatment. Dynamic expression patterns of ZmARF genes were observed in different stages of embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS: Maize ARF gene family is expanded (31 genes) as compared to Arabidopsis (23 genes) and rice (25 genes). The expression of these genes in maize is regulated by auxin and small RNAs. Dynamic expression patterns of ZmARF genes in embryo at different stages were detected which suggest that maize ARF genes may be involved in seed development and germination.
21562335	Functional incorporation of sorghum small subunit increases the catalytic turnover rate of Rubisco in transgenic rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rubisco limits photosynthetic CO(2) fixation because of its low catalytic turnover rate (k(cat)) and competing oxygenase reaction. Previous attempts to improve the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco by genetic engineering have gained little progress. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of the small subunit (RbcS) of high k(cat) Rubisco from the C(4) plant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) significantly enhances k(cat) of Rubisco in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa). Three independent transgenic lines expressed sorghum RbcS at a high level, accounting for 30%, 44%, and 79% of the total RbcS. Rubisco was likely present as a chimera of sorghum and rice RbcS, and showed 1.32- to 1.50-fold higher k(cat) than in nontransgenic rice. Rubisco from transgenic lines showed a higher K(m) for CO(2) and slightly lower specificity for CO(2) than nontransgenic controls. These results suggest that Rubisco in rice transformed with sorghum RbcS partially acquires the catalytic properties of sorghum Rubisco. Rubisco content in transgenic lines was significantly increased over wild-type levels but Rubisco activation was slightly decreased. The expression of sorghum RbcS did not affect CO(2) assimilation rates under a range of CO(2) partial pressures. The J(max)/V(cmax) ratio was significantly lower in transgenic line compared to the nontransgenic plants. These observations suggest that the capacity of electron transport is not sufficient to support the increased Rubisco capacity in transgenic rice. Although the photosynthetic rate was not enhanced, the strategy presented here opens the way to engineering Rubisco for improvement of photosynthesis and productivity in the future.
21511810	Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane.	2011	Mol Plant	Cuticular wax forms a hydrophobic barrier on aerial plant organs; it plays an important role in protecting a plant from damage caused by many forms of environmental stress. In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype. We cloned the OsGL1-1 gene by the map-based cloning method and performed a complementation test to confirm the function of the candidate gene. Molecular studies revealed that OsGL1-1 was a member of the OsGL1 family, and contained regions that were homologous to some regions in sterol desaturases and short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought. OsGL1-1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice. The transient expression of OsGL1-1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated that OsGL1-1 is localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus.
21715672	The jasmonate pathway is a key player in systemically induced defense against root knot nematodes in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Complex defense signaling pathways, controlled by different hormones, are involved in the reaction of plants to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stress factors. We studied the ability of salicylic acid, jasmonate (JA), and ethylene (ET) to induce systemic defense in rice (Oryza sativa) against the root knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola. Exogenous ET (ethephon) and JA (methyl jasmonate) supply on the shoots induced a strong systemic defense response in the roots, exemplified by a major up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1a and OsPR1b, while the salicylic acid analog BTH (benzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester) was a less potent systemic defense inducer from shoot to root. Experiments with JA biosynthesis mutants and ET-insensitive transgenics showed that ET-induced defense requires an intact JA pathway, while JA-induced defense was still functional when ET signaling was impaired. Pharmacological inhibition of JA and ET biosynthesis confirmed that JA biosynthesis is needed for ET-induced systemic defense, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data revealed that ET application onto the shoots strongly activates JA biosynthesis and signaling genes in the roots. All data provided in this study point to the JA pathway to play a pivotal role in rice defense against root knot nematodes. The expression of defense-related genes was monitored in root galls caused by M. graminicola. Different analyzed defense genes were attenuated in root galls caused by the nematode at early time points after infection. However, when the exogenous defense inducers ethephon and methyl jasmonate were supplied to the plant, the nematode was less effective in counteracting root defense pathways, hence making the plant more resistant to nematode infection.
21697258	The OsNRAMP1 iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice.	2011	J Exp Bot	Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal toxic to humans and the accumulation of Cd in the rice grain is a major agricultural problem, particularly in Asia. The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here. An OsNRAMP1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The growth of yeast expressing OsNRAMP1 was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector. Moreover, the Cd content of OsNRAMP1-expressing yeast exceeded that of the vector control. The expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki. Over-expression of OsNRAMP1 in rice increased Cd accumulation in the leaves. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of OsNRAMP1 in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots. Our results indicated that OsNRAMP1 is an important protein in high-level Cd accumulation in rice.
21534595	Degradation of cyhalofop-butyl (CyB) by Pseudomonas azotoformans strain QDZ-1 and cloning of a novel gene encoding CyB-hydrolyzing esterase.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	Cyhalofop-butyl (CyB) is a widely used aryloxyphenoxy propanoate (AOPP) herbicide for control of grasses in rice fields. Five CyB-degrading strains were isolated from rice field soil and identified as Agromyces sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., Aquamicrobium sp., Microbacterium sp., and Pseudomonas azotoformans; the results revealed high biodiversity of CyB-degrading bacteria in rice soil. One strain, P. azotoformans QDZ-1, degraded 84.5% of 100 mg L(-1) CyB in 5 days of incubation in a flask and utilized CyB as carbon source for growth. Strain QDZ-1 could also degrade a wide range of other AOPP herbicides. An esterase gene, chbH, which hydrolyzes CyB to cyhalofop acid (CyA), was cloned from strain QDZ-1 and functionally expressed. A chbH-disrupted mutant dchbH was constructed by insertion mutation. Mutant dchbH could not degrade and utilize CyB, suggesting that chbH was the only esterase gene responsible for CyB degradation in strain QDZ-1. ChbH hydrolyzed all AOPP herbicides tested as well as permethrin. The catalytic efficiency of ChbH toward different AOPP herbicides followed the order quizalofop-P-ethyl ≈ fenoxaprop-P-ethyl > CyB ≈ fluazifop-P-butyl > diclofop-methyl ≈ haloxyfop-P-methyl; the results indicated that the chain length of the alcohol moiety strongly affected the biodegradability of the AOPP herbicides, whereas the substitutions in the aromatic ring had only a slight influence.
21502188	Control of abscisic acid catabolism and abscisic acid homeostasis is important for reproductive stage stress tolerance in cereals.	2011	Plant Physiol	Drought stress at the reproductive stage causes pollen sterility and grain loss in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Drought stress induces abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis genes in anthers and ABA accumulation in spikes of drought-sensitive wheat varieties. In contrast, drought-tolerant wheat accumulates lower ABA levels, which correlates with lower ABA biosynthesis and higher ABA catabolic gene expression (ABA 8'-hydroxylase). Wheat TaABA8'OH1 deletion lines accumulate higher spike ABA levels and are more drought sensitive. ABA treatment of the spike mimics the effect of drought, causing high levels of sterility. ABA treatment represses the anther cell wall invertase gene TaIVR1, and drought-tolerant lines appeared to be more sensitive to the effect of ABA. Drought-induced sterility shows similarity to cold-induced sterility in rice (Oryza sativa). In cold-stressed rice, the rate of ABA accumulation was similar in cold-sensitive and cold-tolerant lines during the first 8 h of cold treatment, but in the tolerant line, ABA catabolism reduced ABA levels between 8 and 16 h of cold treatment. The ABA biosynthesis gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase in anthers is mainly expressed in parenchyma cells surrounding the vascular bundle of the anther. Transgenic rice lines expressing the wheat TaABA8'OH1 gene under the control of the OsG6B tapetum-specific promoter resulted in reduced anther ABA levels under cold conditions. The transgenic lines showed that anther sink strength (OsINV4) was maintained under cold conditions and that this correlated with improved cold stress tolerance. Our data indicate that ABA and ABA 8'-hydroxylase play an important role in controlling anther ABA homeostasis and reproductive stage abiotic stress tolerance in cereals.
21502185	The phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 is involved in phosphate homeostasis in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Plant phosphate transporters (PTs) are active in the uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil and its translocation within the plant. Here, we report on the biological properties and physiological roles of OsPht1;8 (OsPT8), one of the PTs belonging to the Pht1 family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of a β-glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporter gene driven by the OsPT8 promoter showed that OsPT8 is expressed in various tissue organs from roots to seeds independent of Pi supply. OsPT8 was able to complement a yeast Pi-uptake mutant and increase Pi accumulation of Xenopus laevis oocytes when supplied with micromolar (33)Pi concentrations at their external solution, indicating that it has a high affinity for Pi transport. Overexpression of OsPT8 resulted in excessive Pi in both roots and shoots and Pi toxic symptoms under the high-Pi supply condition. In contrast, knockdown of OsPT8 by RNA interference decreased Pi uptake and plant growth under both high- and low-Pi conditions. Moreover, OsPT8 suppression resulted in an increase of phosphorus content in the panicle axis and in a decrease of phosphorus content in unfilled grain hulls, accompanied by lower seed-setting rate. Altogether, our data suggest that OsPT8 is involved in Pi homeostasis in rice and is critical for plant growth and development.
21148627	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height. Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d-a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day conditions.
21585570	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein β-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions.	2011	Plant J	In the present study, we investigated the function of the heterotrimeric G protein β-subunit (Gβ) gene (RGB1) in rice. RGB1 knock-down lines were generated in the wild type and d1-5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit (Gα) gene (RGA1). Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5. The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1. The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock-down lines. These results suggest that Gβγ and Gα cooperatively function in cellular proliferation and seed fertility. We discuss the potential predominant role of RGB1 in G protein signaling in rice.
21458419	Proteomic identification of an embryo-specific 1Cys-Prx promoter and analysis of its activity in transgenic rice.	2011	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Proteomic analysis of a rice callus led to the identification of 10 abscisic acid (ABA)-induced proteins as putative products of the embryo-specific promoter candidates. 5'-flanking sequence of 1 Cys-Prx, a highly-induced protein gene, was cloned and analyzed. The transcription initiation site of 1 Cys-Prx maps 96 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon and a TATA-box and putative seed-specific cis-acting elements, RYE and ABRE, are located 26, 115 and 124 bp upstream of the transcription site, respectively. β-glucuronidase (GUS) expression driven by the 1 Cys-Prx promoters was strong in the embryo and aleurone layer and the activity reached up to 24.9 ± 3.3 and 40.5 ± 2.1 pmol (4 MU/min/μg protein) in transgenic rice seeds and calluses, respectively. The activity of the 1 Cys-Prx promoters is much higher than that of the previously-identified embryo-specific promoters, and comparable to that of strong endosperm-specific promoters in rice. GUS expression driven by the 1 Cys-Prx promoters has been increased by ABA treatment and rapidly induced by wounding in callus and at the leaf of the transgenic plants, respectively. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the GUS construct in Arabidopsis suggested that the 1 Cys-Prx promoter also has strong activity in seeds of dicot plants.
21631728	Adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating protein stimulates the transport of AUX1 endosome, which relies on actin cytoskeletal organization in rice root development.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Polar auxin transport, which depends on polarized subcellular distribution of AUXIN RESISTANT 1/LIKE AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) influx carriers and PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers, mediates various processes of plant growth and development. Endosomal recycling of PIN1 is mediated by an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)ribosylation factor (ARF)-GTPase exchange factor protein, GNOM. However, the mediation of auxin influx carrier recycling is poorly understood. Here, we report that overexpression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase-activating protein in rice, stimulates vesicle transport from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus in protoplasts and transgenic plants and induces the accumulation of early endosomes and AUX1. AUX1 endosomes could partially colocalize with FM4-64 labeled early endosome after actin disruption. Furthermore, OsAGAP is involved in actin cytoskeletal organization, and its overexpression tends to reduce the thickness and bundling of actin filaments. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed exocytosis of the AUX1 recycling endosome was not affected in the OsAGAP overexpression cells, and was only slightly promoted when the actin filaments were completely disrupted by Lat B. Thus, we propose that AUX1 accumulation in the OsAGAP overexpression and actin disrupted cells may be due to the fact that endocytosis of the auxin influx carrier AUX1 early endosome was greatly promoted by actin cytoskeleton disruption.
21544623	Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Australian rice varieties and promoter analysis of major pollen allergen gene, Ory s 1.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	A simple protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Australian rice using mature embryos is described. Transgenic plants of two commercial genotypes of Australian rice, Amaroo and Millin, were produced. Transgenic plants were obtained by applying selection pressure to callus and to the regenerated shoots. Exclusion of the selective agent (hygromycin) during plant regeneration was found to be critical for recovery of transgenic plants from these commercial varieties. Transgenic plants were produced after 3 months. The developed system was also used to study spatial and temporal expression of a rice pollen-specific gene, Ory s 1. Expression of pOry s 1::uidA in transgenic rice demonstrated GUS expression in mature pollen, hence indicating potential use of this promoter to direct pollen-specific gene expression. Further Ory s 1 5' deletion study indicated that the pollen-specificity element may reside within -405 bp to the start of the transcription, while the region upstream of -405 contained a cis-acting regulatory element(s) responsible for quantitative expression of this gene.
21499841	OsSDIR1 overexpression greatly improves drought tolerance in transgenic rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Recent genomic and genetic analyses based on Arabidopsis suggest that ubiquitination plays crucial roles in the plant response to abiotic stress and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). However, few such studies have been reported in rice as a monocotyledonous model plant. Taking advantage of strategies in biochemistry, molecular cell biology and genetics, the RING-finger containing E3 ligase OsSDIR1 (Oryza sativa SALT-AND DROUGHT-INDUCED RING FINGER 1) was found to be a candidate drought tolerance gene for engineering of crop plants. The expression of OsSDIR1 was detected in all tissues of rice and up-regulated by drought and NaCl, but not by ABA. In vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrated that OsSDIR1 is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase and that the RING finger region is required for its activity. OsSDIR1 could complement the drought sensitive phenotype of the sdir1 mutant and overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis were more sensitive to ABA, indicating that the OsSDIR1 gene is a functional ortholog of SDIR1. Upon drought treatment, the OsSDIR1-transgenic rice showed strong drought tolerance compared to control plants. Analysis of the stomata aperture revealed that there were more closed stomatal pores in transgenic plants than those of control plants. This result was also confirmed by the water loss assay and leaf related water content (RWC) measurements during drought treatment. Thus, we demonstrated that monocot- and dicot- SDIR1s are conserved yet have diverse functions.
21487048	The Bphi008a gene interacts with the ethylene pathway and transcriptionally regulates MAPK genes in the response of rice to brown planthopper feeding.	2011	Plant Physiol	We examined ways in which the Brown planthopper induced008a (Bphi008a; AY256682) gene of rice (Oryza sativa) enhances the plant's resistance to a specialist herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens). Measurement of the expression levels of ethylene synthases and of ethylene emissions showed that BPH feeding rapidly initiated the ethylene signaling pathway and up-regulated Bphi008a transcript levels after 6 to 96 h of feeding. In contrast, blocking ethylene transduction (using 1-methylcyclopropene) reduced Bphi008a transcript levels in wild-type plants fed upon by BPH. In vitro kinase assays showed that Bphi008a can be phosphorylated by rice Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase5 (OsMPK5), and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region of Bphi008a interacts directly with this kinase. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that this interaction occurs in the nucleus. Subsequently, we found that Bphi008a up-regulation and down-regulation were accompanied by different changes in transcription levels of OsMPK5, OsMPK12, OsMPK13, and OsMPK17 in transgenic plants. Immunoblot analysis also showed that the OsMPK5 protein level increased in overexpressing plants and decreased in RNA interference plants after BPH feeding. In transgenic lines, changes in the expression levels of several enzymes that are important components of the defenses against the BPH were also observed. Finally, yeast two-hybrid screening results showed that Bphi008a is able to interact with a b-ZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP60) and a RNA polymerase polypeptide (SDRP).
21673515	DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Small RNAs are riboregulators that play critical roles in eukaryotic cells. They repress gene expression by acting either on DNA to guide sequence elimination and chromatin remodeling, or on RNA to guide cleavage and translation repression. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa contain four and six DICER-LIKE (DCL) genes with specialized functions in small RNA biogenesis for RNA interference-related processes. We recently profiled genome-wide gene expression in egg and synergid cells in rice. In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell. In addition, we revealed that AtDCL2 is also preferentially expressed in the Arabidopsis egg cell. These findings suggest that small RNA pathways are activated in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis. The activation of these pathways in the egg cell might be essential for egg cell maturation, fertilization, or embryogenesis.
21637806	Isolation of thylakoid membrane complexes from rice by a new double-strips BN/SDS-PAGE and bioinformatics prediction of stromal ridge subunits interaction.	2011	PLoS One	Thylakoid membrane complexes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) play crucial roles in growth and crop production. Understanding of protein interactions within the complex would provide new insights into photosynthesis. Here, a new "Double-Strips BN/SDS-PAGE" method was employed to separate thylakoid membrane complexes in order to increase the protein abundance on 2D-gels and to facilitate the identification of hydrophobic transmembrane proteins. A total of 58 protein spots could be observed and subunit constitution of these complexes exhibited on 2D-gels. The generality of this new approach was confirmed using thylakoid membrane from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and pumpkin (Cucurita spp). Furthermore, the proteins separated from rice thylakoid membrane were identified by the mass spectrometry (MS). The stromal ridge proteins PsaD and PsaE were identified both in the holo- and core- PSI complexes of rice. Using molecular dynamics simulation to explore the recognition mechanism of these subunits, we showed that salt bridge interactions between residues R19 of PsaC and E168 of PasD as well as R75 of PsaC and E91 of PsaD played important roles in the stability of the complex. This stromal ridge subunits interaction was also supported by the subsequent analysis of the binding free energy, the intramolecular distances and the intramolecular energy.
21375689	Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (SGR) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence. In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings. Transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips revealed that Ov-SGR rice seedlings exhibited a number of signs of singlet oxygen response. The genes and their associated biochemical pathways identified provide an insight into how rice plants respond to singlet oxygen at the molecular and physiologic level.
21402917	Identity, regulation, and activity of inducible diterpenoid phytoalexins in maize.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytoalexins constitute a broad category of pathogen- and insect-inducible biochemicals that locally protect plant tissues. Because of their agronomic significance, maize and rice have been extensively investigated for their terpenoid-based defenses, which include insect-inducible monoterpene and sesquiterpene volatiles. Rice also produces a complex array of pathogen-inducible diterpenoid phytoalexins. Despite the demonstration of fungal-induced ent-kaur-15-ene production in maize over 30 y ago, the identity of functionally analogous maize diterpenoid phytoalexins has remained elusive. In response to stem attack by the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and fungi, we observed the induced accumulation of six ent-kaurane-related diterpenoids, collectively termed kauralexins. Isolation and identification of the predominant Rhizopus microsporus-induced metabolites revealed ent-kaur-19-al-17-oic acid and the unique analog ent-kaur-15-en-19-al-17-oic acid, assigned as kauralexins A3 and B3, respectively. Encoding an ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, fungal-induced An2 transcript accumulation precedes highly localized kauralexin production, which can eventually exceed 100 μg · g(-1) fresh weight. Pharmacological applications of jasmonic acid and ethylene also synergize the induced accumulation of kauralexins. Occurring at elevated levels in the scutella of all inbred lines examined, kauralexins appear ubiquitous in maize. At concentrations as low as 10 μg · mL(-1), kauralexin B3 significantly inhibited the growth of the opportunistic necrotroph R. microsporus and the causal agent of anthracnose stalk rot, Colletotrichum graminicola. Kauralexins also exhibited significant O. nubilalis antifeedant activity. Our work establishes the presence of diterpenoid defenses in maize and enables a more detailed analysis of their biosynthetic pathways, regulation, and crop defense function.
21591772	Antioxidant activities of Korean rice wine concentrates.	2011	J Agric Food Chem	The antioxidant activities of six Korean rice wine (KRW) concentrates were measured by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and lipid/malonaldehyde (MA) assays. In the DPPH assay, the antioxidant activities of the KRW concentrates, including Maesilju (MSJ), Kookhwaju-1 (KHJ-1), Kookhwaju-2 (KHJ-2), Gugijaju (GGJ), Sasamju (SSJ), and Sogokju (SGJ), were 40%, 66%, 64%, 35%, 35%, and 63%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrates inhibited the formation of MA from cod liver oil by 49%, 83%, 75%, 82%, 89%, and 90%, respectively, according to the lipid/MA assay. The sample wines were also analyzed for pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids (°Bx), and reducing sugars. The antioxidant activities of volatile extracts of the KRWs extracted by a solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) apparatus were evaluated by aldehyde/carboxylic acid assay. The volatile extracts of MSJ, KHJ-1, KHJ-2, GGJ, SSJ, and SGJ inhibited the oxidation of hexanal by 97%, 99%, 90%, 90%, 50%, and 51%, respectively. Among the nonvolatile extracts of KRWs, KHJ-2 showed the highest inhibitory effect on MA formation.
21605340	Fine mapping of qPAA8, a gene controlling panicle apical development in rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	In rice, one detrimental factor influencing single panicle yield is the frequent occurrence of panicle apical abortion (PAA) under unfavorable climatic conditions. Until now, no detailed genetic information has been available to avoid PAA in rice breeding. Here, we show that the occurrence of PAA is associated with the accumulation of excess hydrogen peroxide. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping for PAA in an F(2) population derived from the cross of L-05261 (PAA line) × IRAT129 (non-PAA variety) identified seven QTLs over a logarithm of the odd (LOD) threshold of 2.5, explaining approximately 50.1% of phenotypic variance for PAA in total. Five of the QTLs with an increased effect from L-05261, were designated as qPAA3-1, qPAA3-2, qPAA4, qPAA5 and qPAA8, and accounted for 6.8%, 5.9%, 4.2%, 13.0% and 12.2% of phenotypic variance, respectively. We found that the PAA in the early heading plants was mainly controlled by qPAA8. Subsequently, using the sub-populations specific for qPAA8 based on marker-assisted selection, we further narrowed qPAA8 to a 37.6-kb interval delimited by markers RM22475 and 8-In112. These results are beneficial for PAA gene clone.
21543885	Altered expression of auxin-related genes in the fatty acid elongase mutant oni1 of rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	VLCFAs are the main components of cuticular wax, which covers and protects plants from physical and biological stresses. However, the effect of fatty acid composition or the physiological role of VLCFAs on plant development under normal growth conditions is not well understood. We analyzed loss-of-function mutants of ONION1 (ONI1) which encodes fatty acid elongase (β-ketoacyl CoA synthase) catalyzing an elongation reaction of a carbon chain of VLCFAs. We showed that oni1 shoot contained a reduced amount of VLCFAs, and differentiation and functionality of an outermost cell layer (L1) were highly perturbed in oni1 shoot. In spite of the L1-specific expression of ONI1, the effects of the oni1 mutation were not restricted to L1, but expanded to inner cells, so that the entire shoot development was impaired including failure of the maintenance of the SAM and ectopic expression of SAM-specific KNOX genes in leaf. Thus, ONI1 function is cell non-autonomous, and signaling from L1 to inner cells may support proper development of inner cells. Here we report that expression of auxin-related genes was affected in oni1 shoot, and we speculate the existence of improper auxin distribution due to a lack of normal L1 in oni1 shoot.
21302323	Effects of rice dreg protein and its hydrolysate on growth performance and small intestine morphology of early-weaned rats.	2011	J Sci Food Agric	BACKGROUND: Protein hydrolysate has more efficient peptide absorption and less hypertonic protein absorption. This study aims to investigate the influences of rice dreg (RD) protein and its hydrolysate on growth and somatropic axis in early-weaned Sprague-Dawley rats in comparison with soybean (SB) protein.

RESULTS: Compared with a SB diet control, a rice dregs protein hydrolysate (RD-H) diet decreased average daily feed intake and feed/gain in weeks 1 (P < 0.01) and 2 (P < 0.05), while an RD diet decreased average daily feed intake and feed/gain in week 1 (P < 0.01). Average daily body gain exhibited no significant differences between either treatment during the 28-day period. After 28 d, villus height and lamina propria depth of jejunum and duodenum were greater in the RD-H treatment than in RD and control treatments (P < 0.01), while serum urea nitrogen concentration was lower in RD and RD-H treatments than in the control (P < 0.05). There were no differences in serum growth hormone concentration, hepatic and muscle insulin-like growth factor-1 expression, and muscle growth hormone receptor expression at 7 and 28 d (P > 0.05), but hepatic growth hormone receptor expression was higher in RD-H treatment than in RD and control treatments after 7 d (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSION: Results showed that RD and RD-H diets improved feed utilisation efficiency in the first 2 weeks post-weaning and small intestine morphology at 28 d post-weaning for an early-weaned mammal compared with a SB diet.
21385395	Exceptional lability of a genomic complex in rice and its close relatives revealed by interspecific and intraspecific comparison and population analysis.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Extensive DNA rearrangement of genic colinearity, as revealed by comparison of orthologous genomic regions, has been shown to be a general concept describing evolutionary dynamics of plant genomes. However, the nature, timing, lineages and adaptation of local genomic rearrangement in closely related species (e.g., within a genus) and haplotype variation of genomic rearrangement within populations have not been well documented.

RESULTS: We previously identified a hotspot for genic rearrangement and transposon accumulation in the Orp region of Asian rice (Oryza sativa, AA) by comparison with its orthologous region in sorghum. Here, we report the comparative analysis of this region with its orthologous regions in the wild progenitor species (O. nivara, AA) of Asian rice and African rice (O. glaberrima) using the BB genome Oryza species (O. punctata) as an outgroup, and investigation of transposon insertion sites and a segmental inversion event in the AA genomes at the population level. We found that Orp region was primarily and recently expanded in the Asian rice species O. sativa and O. nivara. LTR-retrotransposons shared by the three AA-genomic regions have been fixed in all the 94 varieties that represent different populations of the AA-genome species/subspecies, indicating their adaptive role in genome differentiation. However, LTR-retrotransposons unique to either O. nivara or O. sativa regions exhibited dramatic haplotype variation regarding their presence or absence between or within populations/subpopulations.

CONCLUSIONS: The LTR-retrotransposon insertion hotspot in the Orp region was formed recently, independently and concurrently in different AA-genome species, and that the genic rearrangements detected in different species appear to be differentially triggered by transposable elements. This region is located near the end of the short arm of chromosome 8 and contains a high proportion of LTR-retrotransposons similar to observed in the centromeric region of this same chromosome, and thus may represent a genomic region that has recently switched from euchromatic to heterochromatic states. The haplotype variation of LTR-retrotransposon insertions within this region reveals substantial admixture among various subpopulations as established by molecular markers at the whole genome level, and can be used to develop retrotransposon junction markers for simple and rapid classification of O. sativa germplasm.
21447055	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture. Morphological analyses reveal that panicles of two mutants produced more inflorescence branches, especially the primary branches, and contained more grains. Moreover, mutant plants also display more lodging resistance than the wild type. The grain yield per plant in mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful potential for high grain yield in rice breeding. Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein. RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in the branch primordial region. Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that LP might be involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we confirm that LP is an F-box protein and could interact with rice SKP1-like protein in an F-box domain-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues. These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants.
21418356	Rice CYP734As function as multisubstrate and multifunctional enzymes in brassinosteroid catabolism.	2011	Plant J	Catabolism of brassinosteroids regulates the endogenous level of bioactive brassinosteroids. In Arabidopsis thaliana, bioactive brassinosteroids such as castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) are inactivated mainly by two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, CYP734A1/BAS1 and CYP72C1/SOB7/CHI2/SHK1; CYP734A1/BAS1 inactivates CS and BL by means of C-26 hydroxylation. Here, we characterized CYP734A orthologs from Oryza sativa (rice). Overexpression of rice CYP734As in transgenic rice gave typical brassinosteroid-deficient phenotypes. These transformants were deficient in both the bioactive CS and its precursors downstream of the C-22 hydroxylation step. Consistent with this result, recombinant rice CYP734As utilized a range of C-22 hydroxylated brassinosteroid intermediates as substrates. In addition, rice CYP734As can catalyze hydroxylation and the second and third oxidations to produce aldehyde and carboxylate groups at C-26 in vitro. These results indicate that rice CYP734As are multifunctional, multisubstrate enzymes that control the endogenous bioactive brassinosteroid content both by direct inactivation of CS and by the suppression of CS biosynthesis by decreasing the levels of brassinosteroid precursors.
21719639	The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Ubiquitin-regulated protein degradation is a critical regulatory mechanism that controls a wide range of biological processes in plants. Here, we report that OsDIS1 (for Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought-stress signal transduction in rice (O. sativa). The expression of OsDIS1 was up-regulated by drought treatment. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that OsDIS1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that the conserved region of the RING finger was required for the activity. Transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and rice protoplasts indicated that OsDIS1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought-responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that OsDIS1 interacted with OsNek6 (for O. sativa NIMA-related kinase 6), a tubulin complex-related serine/threonine protein kinase. Coexpression assays in N. benthamiana leaves indicated that OsNek6 was degraded by OsDIS1 via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway and that this degradation was abolished by the OsDIS1(H71Y) mutation, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity. Together, these results demonstrate that OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice.
21635585	Tn5 transposase-assisted transformation of indica rice.	2011	Plant J	Here, we describe experiments on Tn5 transposase-assisted transformation of indica rice. Transposomes were formed in vitro as a result of hyperactive Tn5 transposase complexing with a transposon that contained a 19-bp tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence. To form modified projectiles for transformation, the Tn10-derived prokaryotic tetracycline repressor (TetR) proteins, which can bind transposomes via the high affinity of TetR for tetO, were immobilized onto the surface of bare gold microscopic particles. These projectiles were introduced into cells of the indica rice cultivar Zhuxian B by particle bombardment. Once projectiles were inside the cell, tetracycline induced an allosteric conformational change in TetR that resulted in the dissociation of TetR from tetO, and thus generated free transposomes. Molecular evidence of transposition was obtained by the cloning of insertion sites from many transgenic plants. We also demonstrated that the introduced foreign DNA was inherited stably over several generations. This technique is a promising transformation method for other plant species as it is species independent.
21436381	Functional diversity of isoamylase oligomers: the ISA1 homo-oligomer is essential for amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm has two isoamylase (ISA) oligomers, ISA1 homo-oligomer and ISA1-ISA2 hetero-oligomer. To examine their contribution to starch synthesis, expression of the ISA1 or ISA2 gene was differently regulated in various transgenic plants. Although suppression of ISA2 gene expression caused the endosperm to have only the homo-oligomer, no significant effects were detected on the starch phenotypes. In contrast, ISA2 overexpression led to endosperm having only the hetero-oligomer, and starch synthesis in the endosperm was drastically impaired, both quantitatively and qualitatively, because the starch was devoid of typical starch features, such as thermal and x-ray diffraction properties, and water-soluble highly branched maltodextrins were accumulated. In the ISA2 overexpressed line, about 60% to 70% of the ISA1-ISA2 hetero-oligomer was bound to starch, while the ISA homo- and hetero-oligomers from the wild type were mostly present in the soluble form at the early milking stage of the endosperm. Detailed analysis of the relative amounts of homo- and hetero-oligomers in various lines also led us to the conclusion that the ISA1 homo-oligomer is essential, but not the ISA1-ISA2 oligomer, for starch production in rice endosperm. The relative amounts of ISA1 and ISA2 proteins were shown to determine the ratio of both oligomers and the stoichiometry of both ISAs in the hetero-oligomer. It was noted when compared with the homo-oligomer that all the hetero-oligomers from rice endosperm and leaf and potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber were much more stable at 40°C. This study provides substantial data on the structural and functional diversity of ISA oligomers between plant tissues and species.
21483860	A conserved cysteine motif is critical for rice ceramide kinase activity and function.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Ceramide kinase (CERK) is a key regulator of cell survival in dicotyledonous plants and animals. Much less is known about the roles of CERK and ceramides in mediating cellular processes in monocot plants. Here, we report the characterization of a ceramide kinase, OsCERK, from rice (Oryza sativa spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) and investigate the effects of ceramides on rice cell viability.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: OsCERK can complement the Arabidopsis CERK mutant acd5. Recombinant OsCERK has ceramide kinase activity with Michaelis-Menten kinetics and optimal activity at 7.0 pH and 40°C. Mg2+ activates OsCERK in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, a CXXXCXXC motif, conserved in all ceramide kinases and important for the activity of the human enzyme, is critical for OsCERK enzyme activity and in planta function. In a rice protoplast system, inhibition of CERK leads to cell death and the ratio of added ceramide and ceramide-1-phosphate, CERK's substrate and product, respectively, influences cell survival. Ceramide-induced rice cell death has apoptotic features and is an active process that requires both de novo protein synthesis and phosphorylation, respectively. Finally, mitochondria membrane potential loss previously associated with ceramide-induced cell death in Arabidopsis was also found in rice, but it occurred with different timing.

CONCLUSIONS: OsCERK is a bona fide ceramide kinase with a functionally and evolutionarily conserved Cys-rich motif that plays an important role in modulating cell fate in plants. The vital function of the conserved motif in both human and rice CERKs suggests that the biochemical mechanism of CERKs is similar in animals and plants. Furthermore, ceramides induce cell death with similar features in monocot and dicot plants.
21512732	Phytochrome B regulates Heading date 1 (Hd1)-mediated expression of rice florigen Hd3a and critical day length in rice.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Many plants require circadian clock and light information for the photoperiodic control of flowering. In Arabidopsis, a long-day plant (LDP), flowering is triggered by the circadian clock-controlled expression of CONSTANS (CO) and light stabilization of the CO protein to induce FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T). In rice, a short-day plant (SDP), the CO ortholog Heading date 1 (Hd1) regulates FT ortholog Hd3a, but regulation of Hd3a by Hd1 differs from that in Arabidopsis. Here, we report that phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated suppression of Hd3a is a primary cause of long-day suppression of flowering in rice, based on the three complementary discoveries. First, overexpression of Hd1 causes a delay in flowering under SD conditions and this effect requires phyB, suggesting that light modulates Hd1 control of Hd3a transcription. Second, a single extension of day length decreases Hd3a expression proportionately with the length of daylight. Third, Hd1 protein levels in Hd1-overexpressing plants are not altered in the presence of light. These results also suggest that phyB-mediated suppression of Hd3a expression is a component of the molecular mechanism for critical day length in rice.
21324061	Transcriptional characteristics of Xa21-mediated defense responses in rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is the most destructive bacterial disease of rice. The cloned rice gene Xa21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xoo races. To identify genes involved in Xa21-mediated immunity, a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray of rice was used to profile the expression of rice genes between incompatible interactions and mock treatments at 0, 4, 8, 24, 72 and 120 h post inoculation (hpi) or between incompatible and compatible interactions at 4 hpi, respectively. A total of 441 differentially expressed genes, designated as XDGs (Xa21 mediated differentially expressed genes), were identified. Based on their functional annotations, the XDGs were assigned to 14 categories, including defense-related, signaling, transcriptional regulators. Most of the defense-related genes belonged to the pathogenesis-related gene family, which was induced dramatically at 72 and 120 hpi. Interestingly, most signaling and transcriptional regulator genes were downregulated at 4 and 8 hpi, suggesting that negative regulation of cellular signaling may play a role in the Xa21-mediated defense response. Comparison of expression profiles between Xa21- and other R gene-mediated defense systems revealed interesting common responses. Representative XDGs with supporting evidences were also discussed.
21547461	The WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY78 regulates stem elongation and seed development in rice.	2011	Planta	WRKY proteins are a large super family of transcriptional regulators primarily involved in various plant physiological programs. In present study, the expression profile and putative function of the WRKY transcriptional factor, WRKY78, in rice were identified. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that OsWRKY78 transcript was most abundant in elongating stems though its expression was detected in all the tested organs. The expression profiles were further confirmed by using promoter-GUS analysis in transgenic rice. OsWRKY78::GFP fusion gene transient expression analysis demonstrated that OsWRKY78 targeted to the nuclei of onion epidermal cell. Furthermore, OsWRKY78 RNAi and overexpression transgenic rice lines were generated. Transgenic plants with OsWRKY78 overexpression exhibited a phenotype identical to the wild type, whereas inhibition of OsWRKY78 expression resulted in a semi-dwarf and small kernel phenotype due to reduced cell length in transgenic plants. In addition, a T-DNA insertion mutant line oswrky78 was identified and a phenotype similar to that of RNAi plants was also observed. Grain quality analysis data showed no significant differences, with the exception of minor changes in endosperm starch crystal structure in RNAi plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsWRKY78 may acts as a stem elongation and seed development regulator in rice.
21575088	An atypical heterotrimeric G-protein γ-subunit is involved in guard cell K⁺-channel regulation and morphological development in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2011	Plant J	Currently, there are strong inconsistencies in our knowledge of plant heterotrimeric G-proteins that suggest the existence of additional members of the family. We have identified a new Arabidopsis G-protein γ-subunit (AGG3) that modulates morphological development and ABA-regulation of stomatal aperture. AGG3 strongly interacts with the Arabidopsis G-protein β-subunit in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, AGG3-deficient mutants account for all but one of the 'orphan' phenotypes previously unexplained by the two known γ-subunits in Arabidopsis. AGG3 has unique characteristics never before observed in plant or animal systems, such as its size (more than twice that of canonical γ-subunits) and the presence of a C-terminal Cys-rich domain. AGG3 thus represent a novel class of G-protein γ-subunits, widely spread throughout the plant kingdom but not present in animals. Homologues of AGG3 in rice have been identified as important quantitative trait loci for grain size and yield, but due to the atypical nature of the proteins their identity as G-protein subunits was thus far unknown. Our work demonstrates a similar trend in seeds of Arabidopsis agg3 mutants, and implicates G-proteins in such a crucial agronomic trait. The discovery of this highly atypical subunit reinforces the emerging notion that plant and animal G-proteins have distinct as well as shared evolutionary pathways.
21655219	Knockdown of midgut genes by dsRNA-transgenic plant-mediated RNA interference in the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technique for functional genomics research in insects. Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been reported for lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, showing potential for field-level control of insect pests, but this has not been reported for other insect orders.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Hemipteran insect brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a typical phloem sap feeder specific to rice (Oryza sativa L.). To analyze the potential of exploiting RNAi-mediated effects in this insect, we identified genes (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) encoding proteins that might be involved in the RNAi pathway in N. lugens. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously in nymphs and adult insects. Three genes (the hexose transporter gene NlHT1, the carboxypeptidase gene Nlcar and the trypsin-like serine protease gene Nltry) that are highly expressed in the N. lugens midgut were isolated and used to develop dsRNA constructs for transforming rice. RNA blot analysis showed that the dsRNAs were transcribed and some of them were processed to siRNAs in the transgenic lines. When nymphs were fed on rice plants expressing dsRNA, levels of transcripts of the targeted genes in the midgut were reduced; however, lethal phenotypic effects after dsRNA feeding were not observed.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that genes for the RNAi pathway (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) are present in N. lugens. When insects were fed on rice plant materials expressing dsRNAs, RNA interference was triggered and the target genes transcript levels were suppressed. The gene knockdown technique described here may prove to be a valuable tool for further investigations in N. lugens. The results demonstrate the potential of dsRNA-mediated RNAi for field-level control of planthoppers, but appropriate target genes must be selected when designing the dsRNA-transgenic plants.
21384112	Fine mapping of qSTV11(KAS), a major QTL for rice stripe disease resistance.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rice stripe disease, caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), is one of the most serious diseases in temperate rice-growing areas. In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the highly resistant variety, Kasalath, and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare. Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, designated qSTV7 and qSTV11(KAS), were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respectively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11 under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of qSTV11(KAS) was validated using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines. Fine mapping of qSTV11(KAS) was carried out using 372 BC(3)F(2:3) recombinants and 399 BC(3)F(3:4) lines selected from 7,018 BC(3)F(2) plants of the cross SL-234/Koshihikari. The qSTV11(KAS) was localized to a 39.2 kb region containing seven annotated genes. The most likely candidate gene, LOC_Os11g30910, is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein. The predicted protein encoded by the Kasalath allele differs from Nipponbare by a single amino acid substitution and the deletion of two amino acids within the sulfotransferase domain. Marker-resistance association analysis revealed that the markers L104-155 bp and R48-194 bp were highly correlated with RSV resistance in the 148 landrace varieties. These results provide a basis for the cloning of qSTV11(KAS), and the markers may be used for molecular breeding of RSV resistant rice varieties.
21443626	Evolutionary and comparative analysis of MYB and bHLH plant transcription factors.	2011	Plant J	The expansion of gene families encoding regulatory proteins is typically associated with the increase in complexity characteristic of multi-cellular organisms. The MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) families provide excellent examples of how gene duplication and divergence within particular groups of transcription factors are associated with, if not driven by, the morphological and metabolic diversity that characterize the higher plants. These gene families expanded dramatically in higher plants; for example, there are approximately 339 and 162 MYB and bHLH genes, respectively, in Arabidopsis, and approximately 230 and 111, respectively, in rice. In contrast, the Chlamydomonas genome has only 38 MYB genes and eight bHLH genes. In this review, we compare the MYB and bHLH gene families from structural, evolutionary and functional perspectives. The knowledge acquired on the role of many of these factors in Arabidopsis provides an excellent reference to explore sequence-function relationships in crops and other plants. The physical interaction and regulatory synergy between particular sub-classes of MYB and bHLH factors is perhaps one of the best examples of combinatorial plant gene regulation. However, members of the MYB and bHLH families also interact with a number of other regulatory proteins, forming complexes that either activate or repress the expression of sets of target genes that are increasingly being identified through a diversity of high-throughput genomic approaches. The next few years are likely to witness an increasing understanding of the extent to which conserved transcription factors participate at similar positions in gene regulatory networks across plant species.
21501172	Investigation of the potential for triterpene synthesis in rice through genome mining and metabolic engineering.	2011	New Phytol	The first committed step in sterol biosynthesis in plants involves the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene by the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) enzyme cycloartenol synthase. 2,3-Oxidosqualene is also a precursor for triterpene synthesis. Antimicrobial triterpenes are common in dicots, but seldom found in monocots, with the notable exception of oat. Here, through genome mining and metabolic engineering, we investigate the potential for triterpene synthesis in rice. The first two steps in the oat triterpene pathway are catalysed by a divergent OSC (AsbAS1) and a cytochrome P450 (CYP51). The genes for these enzymes form part of a metabolic gene cluster. To investigate the origins of triterpene synthesis in monocots, we analysed systematically the OSC and CYP51 gene families in rice. We also engineered rice for elevated triterpene content. We discovered a total of 12 OSC and 12 CYP51 genes in rice and uncovered key events in the evolution of triterpene synthesis. We further showed that the expression of AsbAS1 in rice leads to the accumulation of the simple triterpene, β-amyrin. These findings provide new insights into the evolution of triterpene synthesis in monocots and open up opportunities for metabolic engineering for disease resistance in rice and other cereals.
21673510	Common and distinct mechanisms underlying the establishment of adaxial and abaxial polarity in stamen and leaf development.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity is essential for lateral organ development. A stamen consists of a bilaterally symmetrical anther and a radial filament. Using a rice mutant, rod-like lemma, in which establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity is compromised, we found that stamen patterning is likely to be achieved by a unique regulatory mechanism: rearrangement of adaxial-abaxial polarity in the anther, and abaxialization in the filament. These regulations are not found in leaf development. Here, we discuss similarities and differences between the stamen and the leaf in the mechanisms underlying the establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity. In addition, we propose the idea that the process of establishing adaxial-abaxial polarity in lateral organs is likely to be divided into two phases: a meristem-dependent, followed by a meristem-independent phase. In stamen development, the transition between these two phases is clearly observed as the rearrangement of expression patterns of the adaxial and abaxial marker genes.
21546791	Methanol elicits the biosynthesis of 4-coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin in rice seedlings.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Rice (Oryza sativa cv. Dongjin) plants responded to treatment with methanol by inducing the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as serotonin derivatives which include feruloylserotonin and 4-coumaroylserotonin. This response was not only a dose dependence on methanol showing a maximum effect with 1% methanol concentration, but also methanol specific. No other solvents such as ethanol, atetaldehyde, isopropanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid showed the induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives as methanol did. The methanol induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives was completely blocked by the addition of abscisic acid (ABA), and significantly inhibited by the additions of zeatin and indoleacetic acid (IAA). However, gibberellic acid (GA) had little effect on the action of methanol. Finally, the induced synthesis of serotonin derivatives upon methanol treatment was closely associated with the transient increase in the activity of key enzyme of serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (SHT) which catalyzes the condensation of serotonin and phenolic-CoA into serotonin derivatives.
21369877	Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) are two essential elements for plant growth and development. While it is known that plants possess specific membrane transporters for transporting K+ and Cl-, it remains unclear if they actively use K+-coupled Cl- cotransporters (KCC), as used in animals, to transport K+ and Cl-. We have cloned an Oryza sativa cDNA encoding for a member of the cation-Cl- cotransporter (CCC) family. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that plant CCC proteins are highly conserved and that they have greater sequence similarity to the sub-family of animal K--Cl- cotransporters than to other cation-Cl- cotransporters. Real-time PCR revealed that the O. sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant. The OsCCC1 protein was located not only in onion plasma membrane but also in O. sativa plasma membrane. The OsCCC1 gene-silenced plants grow more slowly than wild-type (WT) plants, especially under the KCl treatment regime. After 1 month of KCl treatment, the leaf tips of the gene-silenced lines were necrosed. In addition, seed germination, root length, and fresh and dry weight were distinctly lower in the gene-silenced lines than in WT plants, especially after KCl treatment. Analysis of Na+, K+, and Cl- contents of the gene-silenced lines and WT plants grown under the NaCl and KCl treatment regimes revealed that the former accumulated relatively less K+ and Cl- than the latter but that they did not differ in terms of Na+ contents, suggesting OsCCC1 may be involved in K+ and Cl- transport. Results from different tests indicated that the OsCCC1 plays a significant role in K+ and Cl- homeostasis and rice plant development.
21705640	The COP1 ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice.	2011	Plant Cell	Because plant reproductive development occurs only in adult plants, the juvenile-to-adult phase change is an indispensable part of the plant life cycle. We identified two allelic mutants, peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) and pps-2, that prolong the juvenile phase in rice (Oryza sativa) and showed that rice PPS is an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. The pps-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant. In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the pps-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in pps-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway. PPS is strongly expressed in the fourth and fifth leaves, suggesting that it regulates the onset of the adult phase downstream of MORI1 and upstream of miR156 and miR172. Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots.
21683877	Genetic analysis of cysteine-poor prolamin polypeptides reduced in the endosperm of the rice esp1 mutant.	2011	Plant Sci	The esp1 mutant CM21 specifically exhibits reduced levels of cysteine-poor (CysP) prolamin bands with pIs of 6.65, 6.95, 7.10, and 7.35 in rice seed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis demonstrated that the bands with pIs 6.65, 6.95, and 7.35 are encoded by different structural genes. These results suggest that the Esp1 locus encodes a regulatory factor involved in the synthesis and/or accumulation of CysP prolamin molecules. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis of CysP prolamins in chromosome substitution lines showed that structural genes for bands with pI values of 6.95, 7.10, and 7.35, which are reduced in esp1 mutant lines, are located as a gene cluster in the 44.2 cM region on chromosome 5.
21543727	Application of gene targeting to designed mutation breeding of high-tryptophan rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Site-directed mutagenesis via gene targeting (GT) based on homologous recombination is the ultimate mutation breeding technology because it enables useful information acquired from structural- and computational-based protein engineering to be applied directly to molecular breeding, including metabolic engineering, of crops. Here, we employed this rationale to introduce precise mutations in OASA2--an α-subunit of anthranilate synthase that is a key enzyme of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa)--via GT, with subsequent selection of GT cells using a Trp analog. The expression level of OASA2 in plants homozygous and heterozygous for modified OASA2 was similar to that of nontransformants, suggesting that OASA2 transcription in GT plants was controlled in the same manner as endogenous OASA2, and that GT could lead to a lower risk of gene silencing than in conventional overexpression approaches. Moreover, we showed that enzymatic properties deduced from protein engineering or in vitro analysis could be reproduced in GT plants as evidenced by Trp accumulation levels. Interestingly, mature seeds of homozygous GT plants accumulated Trp levels 230-fold higher than in nontransformants without any apparent morphological or developmental changes. Thus, we have succeeded in producing a novel rice plant of great potential nutritional benefit for both man and livestock that could not have been selected using conventional mutagenesis approaches. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of directed crop improvement by combining precision mutagenesis via GT with a knowledge of protein engineering.
21448719	Physiological mechanisms underlying OsNAC5-dependent tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress.	2011	Planta	To understand the functions of transcription factor OsNAC5 in response to abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants with knockdown OsNAC5 by RNA-interfered (RNAi) and overexpressing OsNAC5, and investigated the effects of cold, drought and salt stress on wild-type (WT), RNAi and overexpression rice lines. Our results demonstrated that RNAi lines became less tolerant to these stresses than WT plants, while overexpression of OsNAC5 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced tolerance to these stresses. The mechanisms underlying the changes in tolerance of the transgenic rice plants to abiotic stresses were explored by measuring free proline (Pro) and soluble sugar contents in WT and transgenic plants. Accumulation of Pro and soluble sugars was positively correlated with OsNAC5 expression levels. The less accumulation of Pro in RNAi lines may be accounted for by inhibition of Pro synthesis and transport at transcriptional levels. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of OsNAC5 enhanced and reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2), suggesting that knockdown of OsNAC5 renders RNAi plants more susceptible to oxidative damage. The RNAi lines displayed higher Na(+)/K(+) ratio due to greater accumulation of Na(+) ions than WT under salt stress conditions, and expression of genes encoding tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporter was lower in RNAi lines than in WT under both control and salt-stressed conditions. Seed germination of RNAi and overexpression plants was more and less inhibited by salt and mannitol than that of WT, respectively. Seed germination of overexpression and RNAi plants was more and less sensitive than that of WT to ABA. These findings highlight the important role of OsNAC5 played in the tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress by regulating downstream targets associated with accumulation of compatible solutes, Na(+) ions, H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde.
21209026	Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls.	2011	J Exp Bot	The brittle culm (bc) mutants of Gramineae plants having brittle skeletal structures are valuable materials for studying secondary cell walls. In contrast to other recessive bc mutants, rice Bc6 is a semi-dominant bc mutant with easily breakable plant bodies. In this study, the Bc6 gene was cloned by positional cloning. Bc6 encodes a cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, OsCesA9, and has a missense mutation in its highly conserved region. In culms of the Bc6 mutant, the proportion of cellulose was reduced by 38%, while that of hemicellulose was increased by 34%. Introduction of the semi-dominant Bc6 mutant gene into wild-type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that Bc6 mutation reduced the cell wall thickness of sclerenchymal cells in culms. In rice expressing a reporter construct, BC6 promoter activity was detected in the culms, nodes, and flowers, and was localized primarily in xylem tissues. This expression pattern was highly similar to that of BC1, which encodes a COBRA-like protein involved in cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls in rice. These results indicate that BC6 is a secondary cell wall-specific CesA that plays an important role in proper deposition of cellulose in the secondary cell walls.
21408199	Genome-wide identification, characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the rice LRR-kinases.	2011	PLoS One	LRR-kinases constitute the largest subfamily of receptor-like kinases in plants and regulate a wide variety of processes related to development and defense. Through a reiterative process of sequence analysis and re-annotation, we identified 309 LRR-kinase genes in the rice genome (Nipponbare). Among them, 127 genes in the Rice Annotation Project Database and 85 in Refseq of NCBI were amended (in addition, 62 LRR-kinase genes were not annotated in Refseq). The complete set of LRR-kinases was characterized. These LRR-kinases were classified into five groups according to phylogenetic analysis, and the genes in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 usually have fewer introns than those in group 5. The introns in the LRR domain, which are highly conserved in regards to their positions and configurations, split the first Leu or other amino residues at this position of the 'xxLxLxx' motif with phase 2 and usually separate one or more LRR repeats exactly. Tandemly repeated LRR motifs have evolved from exon duplication, mutation and exon shuffling. The extensive distribution and diversity of the LRR-kinase genes have been mainly generated by tandem duplication and mutation after whole genome duplication. Positive selection has made a limited contribution to the sequence diversity after duplication, but positively selected sites located in the LRR domain are thought to involve in the protein-protein interaction.
21215616	Sorption and ecotoxicity of pentachlorophenol polluted sediment amended with rice-straw derived biochar.	2011	Bioresour Technol	To investigate the feasibility of using biochar to control organic pollutants in sediments, we extracted biochar from rice-straw combustion residues (RBC) and studied its adsorption ability and effect on seed germination ecotoxicity of pentachlorophenol (PCP). The results showed that the Freundlich and dual-mode models could describe all the sorption isotherm data well, and the log K(OC) values increased with increasing RBC content. With 50 mg kg(-1) PCP in the sediment, a significant seed growth inhibition (P<0.01) was observed. The addition of 2.0% RBC lowered the PCP concentration in the extraction liquid from 4.53 to 0.17 mg L(-1) and increased the germination rate and root length significantly. Furthermore, it was found that the addition of RBC had no toxic but stimulative effect on root elongation. Consequently, RBC could serve as a potential supersorbent for the remediation of organic pollution in situ.
21602276	A rice phenolic efflux transporter is essential for solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic iron in the plant stele.	2011	J Biol Chem	Iron deficiency is one of the major agricultural problems, as 30% of the arable land of the world is too alkaline for optimal crop production, rendering plants short of available iron despite its abundance. To take up apoplasmic precipitated iron, plants secrete phenolics such as protocatechuic acid (PCA) and caffeic acid. The molecular pathways and genes of iron uptake strategies are already characterized, whereas the molecular mechanisms of phenolics synthesis and secretion have not been clarified, and no phenolics efflux transporters have been identified in plants yet. Here we describe the identification of a phenolics efflux transporter in rice. We identified a cadmium-accumulating rice mutant in which the amount of PCA and caffeic acid in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced and hence named it phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1). PEZ1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported PCA when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. PEZ1 localized mainly in the stele of roots. In the roots of pez1, precipitated apoplasmic iron increased. The growth of PEZ1 overexpression lines was severely restricted, and these lines accumulated more iron as a result of the high solubilization of precipitated apoplasmic iron in the stele. We show that PEZ1 is responsible for an increase of PCA concentration in the xylem sap and is essential for the utilization of apoplasmic precipitated iron in the stele.
21426477	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	We generated rice lines with increased content of nicotianamine (NA), a key ligand for metal transport and homeostasis. This was accomplished by activation tagging of rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2). Enhanced expression of the gene resulted in elevated NA levels, greater Zn accumulations and improved plant tolerance to a Zn deficiency. Expression of Zn-uptake genes and those for the biosynthesis of phytosiderophores (PS) were increased in transgenic plants. This suggests that the higher amount of NA led to greater exudation of PS from the roots, as well as stimulated Zn uptake, translocation and seed-loading. In the endosperm, the OsNAS2 activation-tagged line contained up to 20-fold more NA and 2.7-fold more zinc. Liquid chromatography combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that the total content of zinc complexed with NA and 2'-deoxymugineic acid was increased 16-fold. Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from a zinc deficiency than did control mice receiving WT seeds. These results demonstrate that the level of bio-available zinc in rice grains can be enhanced significantly by activation tagging of OsNAS2.
21481033	The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling.	2011	Plant J	Cytokinin is known to have negative effects on de novo auxin-induced root formation. However, the regulatory mechanisms of root initiation by both cytokinin and auxin are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (crl5), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia. The expression of CRL5, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs. Exogenous auxin treatment induced CRL5 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, which also required the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins. A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation. A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation. In addition, ProACT:CRL5/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in crl5. Transgenic plants that over-expressed OsRR1 under the control of the CRL5 promoter in a crl5 mutant background produced a higher number of crown roots than the crl5 plant. Taken together, these results indicate that auxin-induced CRL5 promotes crown root initiation through repression of cytokinin signaling by positively regulating type-A RR, OsRR1.
21606318	OsREC8 is essential for chromatid cohesion and metaphase I monopolar orientation in rice meiosis.	2011	Plant Physiol	The successful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis relies on the establishment and subsequent release of cohesion between replicated chromatids. Cohesion is mediated by a four-subunit structural maintenance of chromosome complex, called cohesins. REC8 is a key component of this meiotic cohesion complex in most model organisms studied to date. Here, we isolated and dissected the functions of OsREC8, a rice (Oryza sativa) REC8 homolog, using two null Osrec8 mutants. We showed that OsREC8 encodes a protein that localized to meiotic chromosomes from approximately meiotic interphase to metaphase I. Homologous pairing and telomere bouquet formation were abnormal in Osrec8 meiocytes. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments on Osrec8 meiocytes demonstrated that the mutation eliminated meiotic centromeric cohesion completely during prophase I and also led to the bipolar orientation of the kinetochores during the first meiotic division and accordingly resulted in premature separation of sister chromatid during meiosis I. Immunolocalization analyses revealed that the loading of PAIR2, PAIR3, OsMER3, and ZEP1 all depended on OsREC8. By contrast, the presence of the OsREC8 signal in pair2, pair3, Osmer3, and zep1 mutants indicated that the loading of OsREC8 did not rely on these four proteins. These results suggest that OsREC8 has several essential roles in the meiotic processes.
21521743	A role for the cysteine-rich 10 kDa prolamin in protein body I formation in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice prolamins consist of cysteine-rich 10 kDa (CysR10), 14 kDa (CysR14) and 16 kDa (CysR16) molecular species and a cysteine-poor 13 kDa (CysP13) polypeptide. These storage proteins form protein bodies (PBs) composed of single spherical intracisternal inclusions assembled within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that CysR10 and CysP13 were asymmetrically distributed within the PBs, with the former concentrated at the electron-dense center core region and the latter distributed mainly to the electron-lucent peripheral region. These results together with temporal expression data showed that the formation of prolamin-containing PB-I in the wild-type endosperm was initiated by the accumulation of CysR10 to form the center core. In mutants deficient for cysteine-rich prolamins, the typical PB-I structures containing the electron-dense center core were not observed, and instead were replaced by irregularly shaped, electron-lucent, hypertrophied PBs. Similar, deformed PBs were observed in a CysR10 RNA interference plant line. These results suggest that CysR10, through its formation of the central core and its possible interaction with other cysteine-rich prolamins, is required for tight packaging of the proteins into a compact spherical structure.

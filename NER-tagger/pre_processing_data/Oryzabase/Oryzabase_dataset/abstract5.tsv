9654133	Characterization of a gene encoding an abscisic acid-inducible type-2 lipid transfer protein from rice.	1998	FEBS Lett	The cloning and sequence analysis of a novel gene that encodes a type 2 non-specific lipid transfer-like protein (LTP) from rice is reported. Sequence analysis revealed an ORF encoding a protein showing characteristics of the LTP proteins. However, rice LTP2 is more similar to heterologous LTPs than to rice LTP1, supporting the existence of two distinct families of plant LTPs. Ltp2 mRNA is accumulated only in mature seeds. In vegetative tissues, mRNA was only detected after treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), mannitol or NaCl. Transient expression experiments that the 61 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box, containing two ACGT boxes and the motif I, are sufficient for ABA responsiveness of the Ltp gene.
12795699	Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model.	2003	Plant J	Na+ uptake in the roots of K+-starved seedlings of barley, rice, and wheat was found to exhibit fast rate, low Km, and high sensitivity to K+. Sunflower plants responded in a similar manner but the uptake was not K+ sensitive. Ba2+ inhibited Na+ uptake, but not K+ uptake in rice roots. This demonstrated that Na+ and K+ uptake are mediated by different transporters, and that K+ blocked but was not transported by the Na+ transporter. The genome of rice cv. Nipponbare contains seven HKT genes, which may encode Na+ transporters, plus two HKT pseudogenes. Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+. Parallel experiments of K+ and Na+ uptake in yeast expressing the wheat or rice HKT1 transporters proved that they were very different; TaHKT1 transported K+ and Na+, and OsHKT1 only Na+. Transcript expressions in shoots of the OsHKT genes were fairly constant and insensitive to changes in the K+ and Na+ concentrations of the nutrient solution. In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants. We propose that OsHKT transporters are involved in Na+ movements in rice, and that OsHKT1 specifically mediates Na+ uptake in rice roots when the plants are K+ deficient. The incidence of HKT ESTs in several plant species suggests that the rice model with many HKT genes applies to other plants.
15247372	Overexpression of OsRAA1 causes pleiotropic phenotypes in transgenic rice plants, including altered leaf, flower, and root development and root response to gravity.	2004	Plant Physiol	There are very few root genes that have been described in rice as a monocotyledonous model plant so far. Here, the OsRAA1 (Oryza sativa Root Architecture Associated 1) gene has been characterized molecularly. OsRAA1 encodes a 12.0-kD protein that has 58% homology to the AtFPF1 (Flowering Promoting Factor 1) in Arabidopsis, which has not been reported as modulating root development yet. Data of in situ hybridization and OsRAA1::GUS transgenic plant showed that OsRAA1 expressed specifically in the apical meristem, the elongation zone of root tip, steles of the branch zone, and the young lateral root. Constitutive expression of OsRAA1 under the control of maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter resulted in phenotypes of reduced growth of primary root, increased number of adventitious roots and helix primary root, and delayed gravitropic response of roots in seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa), which are similar to the phenotypes of the wild-type plant treated with auxin. With overexpression of OsRAA1, initiation and growth of adventitious root were more sensitive to treatment of auxin than those of the control plants, while their responses to 9-hydroxyfluorene-9-carboxylic acid in both transgenic line and wild type showed similar results. OsRAA1 constitutive expression also caused longer leaves and sterile florets at the last stage of plant development. Analysis of northern blot and GUS activity staining of OsRAA1::GUS transgenic plants demonstrated that the OsRAA1 expression was induced by auxin. At the same time, overexpression of OsRAA1 also caused endogenous indole-3-acetic acid to increase. These data suggested that OsRAA1 as a new gene functions in the development of rice root systems, which are mediated by auxin. A positive feedback regulation mechanism of OsRAA1 to indole-3-acetic acid metabolism may be involved in rice root development in nature.
10588717	Phylogeny of rice genomes with emphasis on origins of allotetraploid species.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The rice genus, Oryza, which comprises 23 species and 9 recognized genome types, represents an enormous gene pool for genetic improvement of rice cultivars. Clarification of phylogenetic relationships of rice genomes is critical for effective utilization of the wild rice germ plasm. By generating and comparing two nuclear gene (Adh1 and Adh2) trees and a chloroplast gene (matK) tree of all rice species, phylogenetic relationships among the rice genomes were inferred. Origins of the allotetraploid species, which constitute more than one-third of rice species diversity, were reconstructed based on the Adh gene phylogenies. Genome types of the maternal parents of allotetraploid species were determined based on the matK gene tree. The phylogenetic reconstruction largely supports the previous recognition of rice genomes. It further revealed that the EE genome species is most closely related to the DD genome progenitor that gave rise to the CCDD genome. Three species of the CCDD genome may have originated through a single hybridization event, and their maternal parent had the CC genome. The BBCC genome species had different origins, and their maternal parents had either a BB or CC genome. An additional genome type, HHKK, was recognized for Oryza schlechteri and Porteresia coarctata, suggesting that P. coarctata is an Oryza species. The AA genome lineage, which contains cultivated rice, is a recently diverged and rapidly radiated lineage within the rice genus.
10417331	The final step of pantothenate biosynthesis in higher plants: cloning and characterization of pantothenate synthetase from Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativum (rice).	1999	Biochem J	We have isolated a Lotus japonicus cDNA for pantothenate (vitamin B(5)) synthetase (PS) by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli panC mutant (AT1371). A rice (Oryza sativum) expressed sequence tag, identified by sequence similarity to PS, was also able to complement the E. coli auxotroph, as was an open reading frame from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). The Lotus and rice cDNAs encode proteins of approx. 34 kDa, which are 65% similar at the amino acid level and do not appear to encode N-terminal extensions by comparison with PS sequences from other organisms. Furthermore, analysis of genomic sequence flanking the coding sequence for PS in Lotus suggests the original cDNA is full-length. The Lotus and rice PSs are therefore likely to be cytosolic. Southern analysis of Lotus genomic DNA indicates that there is a single gene for PS. Recombinant PS from Lotus, overexpressed in E. coli AT1371, is a dimer. The enzyme requires d-pantoate, beta-alanine and ATP for activity and has a higher affinity for pantoate (K(m) 45 microM) than for beta-alanine (K(m) 990 microM). Uncompetitive substrate inhibition becomes significant at pantoate concentrations above 1 mM. The enzyme displays optimal activity at about 0.5 mM pantoate (k(cat) 0.63 s(-1)) and at pH 7.8. Neither oxopantoate nor pantoyl-lactone can replace pantoate as substrate. Antibodies raised against recombinant PS detected a band of 34 kDa in Western blots of Lotus proteins from both roots and leaves. The implications of these findings for pantothenate biosynthesis in plants are discussed.
9750346	Cloning and characterization of MS5 from Arabidopsis: a gene critical in male meiosis.	1998	Plant J	In this paper, we describe the cloning of the MS5 gene, a gene essential for male fertility in Arabidopsis. We previously defined the MS5 locus by characterizing an EMS-induced allele, ms5-1. We identified a new allele of MS5 (ms5-2) that was T-DNA-generated and used the T-DNA tag to clone the gene. Sequencing of mutant and wild-type alleles together with complementation of the ms5-1 mutant phenotype with a wild-type genomic clone confirmed the identity of the gene. Differences between the phenotypes of the two mutant alleles could be attributed to differences in mutant gene structure. The semi-dominant and dominant negative phenotypes of the ms5-2 mutant probably result from production of a truncated polypeptide. An unknown locus in Landsberg erecta can counteract the dominant negative phenotype of ms5-2. Mutations in MS5 cause the formation 'polyads'--tetrads with more than four pools of chromosomes after male meiosis. Similarities between the MS5 sequence and that of a number of proteins were found; two that may be significant were with a synaptonemal complex protein and with a regulatory subunit of a cyclin-dependent kinase. The MS5 gene is a member of a small gene family highly conserved amongst plant species.
12182709	Characterization of a HKT-type transporter in rice as a general alkali cation transporter.	2002	Plant J	We report the characterization of rice OsHKT1 (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) homologous to the wheat K+/Na+-symporter HKT1. Expression of OsHKT1 in the yeast strain CY162 defective in K+-uptake restored growth at mM and micro M concentrations of K+ and mediated hypersensitivity to Na+. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, rice OsHKT1 showed uptake characteristics of a Na+-transporter but mediated transport of other alkali cations as well. OsHKT1 expression was analysed in salt-tolerant rice Pokkali and salt-sensitive IR29 in response to external cation concentrations. OsHKT1 is expressed in roots and leaves. Exposure to Na+, Rb+, Li+, and Cs+ reduced OsHKT1 transcript amounts in both varieties and, in some cases, incompletely spliced transcripts were observed. By in situ hybridizations the expression of OsHKT1 was localized to the root epidermis and the vascular tissue inside the endodermis. In leaves, OsHKT1 showed strongest signals in cells surrounding the vasculature. The repression of OsHKT1 in the two rice varieties during salt stress was different in various cell types with main differences in the root vascular tissue. The data suggest control over HKT expression as a factor that may distinguish salt stress-sensitive and stress-tolerant lines. Differences in transcript expression in space and time in different lines of the same species appear to be a component of ion homeostasis correlated with salt sensitivity and tolerance.
16021404	OsPPR1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein of rice is essential for the chloroplast biogenesis.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	In this paper, we report a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein gene in rice. PPR, a characteristic repeat motif consisted of tandem 35 amino acids, has been found in various biological systems including plant. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene designated OsPPR1 consisted of an open reading frame of 2433 nucleotides encoding 810 amino acids that include 11 PPR motifs. Blast search result indicated that the gene did not align with any of the characterized PPR genes in plant. The OsPPR1 gene was found to contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide in the N-terminal region, suggesting that the gene product targets to the chloroplast. Southern blot hybridization indicated that the OsPPR1 is the member of a gene family within the rice genome. Expression analysis and immunoblot analysis suggested that the OsPPR1 was accumulated mainly in rice leaf. Antisense transgenic strategy was used to suppress the expression of OsPPR1 and the resulted transgenic rice showed the typical phenotypes of chlorophyll-deficient mutants; albinism and lethality. Cytological observation using microscopy revealed that the antisense transgenic plant contained a significant defect in the chloroplast development. Taken together, the results suggest that the OsPPR1 is a nuclear gene of rice, encoding the PPR protein that might play a role in the chloroplast biogenesis. This is the first report on the PPR protein required for the chloroplast biogenesis in rice.
9748637	Organization and structure of NADH-dependent glutamate synthase gene from rice plants.	1998	Biochim Biophys Acta	Genomic clones for NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT; EC 1.4.1.14) were obtained from a genomic library of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Sasanishki). A genomic clone (lambdaOS42, 14 kb) covered an entire structural gene and a 3.7 kb 5'-upstream region from the first methionine. Another clone (lambdaOS23, 14 kb) contained a 2.8 kb 3'-downstream region from the stop codon. A 7047 bp long clone (lambdaOSR51) consisting of full length cDNA for NADH-GOGAT was isolated from a cDNA library prepared using mRNA from roots of rice seedlings treated with 1 mM NH4Cl for 12 h. The presumed transcribed region (11.7 kb) consisted of 23 exons separated by 22 introns. Rice NADH-GOGAT is synthesized as a 2166 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 236.7 kDa that includes a 99 amino acid presequence. DNA gel blot analysis suggested that NADH-GOGAT occurred as a single gene in rice. Primer extension experiments map the transcription start of NADH-GOGAT to identical positions. The 3. 7 kb 5'-upstream region was able to transiently express a reporter gene in cultured rice cells. Putative motifs related to the regulation of NADH-GOGAT gene expression were looked for within the 5'-upstream region by database.
9065695	MADS box genes expressed in developing inflorescences of rice and sorghum.	1997	Mol Gen Genet	With the aim of elucidating the complex genetic system controlling flower morphogenesis in cereals, we have characterized two rice and two sorghum MADS box genes isolated from cDNA libraries made from developing inflorescences. The rice clones OsMADS24 and OsMADS45, which share high homology with the Arabidopsis AGL2 and AGL4 MADS box genes, are expressed in the floral meristem, in all the primordia, and in mature floral organs. High expression levels have also been found in developing kernels. The sorghum clone SbMADS1 is also homologous to AGL2 and AGL4: expression analysis and mapping data suggest that it is the ortholog of OsMADS24. The pattern of expression of SbMADS2, the other sorghum MADS box gene, suggests that it may play a role as a meristem identity gene, as does AP1 in Arabidopsis, to which it shows considerable homology. The four genes have been mapped on a rice RFLP genetic map: the results are discussed in terms of synteny among cereals.
15973413	R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice.	2005	Nature	Disease resistance (R) genes in plants encode products that specifically recognise incompatible pathogens and trigger a cascade of events leading to disease resistance in the host plant. R-gene specificity is dictated by both host R genes and cognate avirulence (avr) genes in pathogens. However, the basis of gene-for-gene specificity is not well understood. Here, we report the cloning of the R gene Xa27 from rice and the cognate avr gene avrXa27 from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Resistant and susceptible alleles of Xa27 encode identical proteins. However, expression of only the resistant allele occurs when a rice plant is challenged by bacteria harbouring avrXa27, whose product is a nuclear localized type-III effector. Induction of Xa27 occurs only in the immediate vicinity of infected tissue, whereas ectopic expression of Xa27 resulted in resistance to otherwise compatible strains of the pathogen. Thus Xa27 specificity towards incompatible pathogens involves the differential expression of the R gene in the presence of the AvrXa27 effector.

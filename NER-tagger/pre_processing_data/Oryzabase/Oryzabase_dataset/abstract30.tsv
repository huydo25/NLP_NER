22984180	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL1 functions as a key regulator of internode elongation and induces a morphological response to drought stress.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The mechanisms for plant growth restriction during stress conditions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein, OsPIL1/OsPIL13, acts as a key regulator of reduced internode elongation in rice under drought conditions. The level of OsPIL1 mRNA in rice seedlings grown under nonstressed conditions with light/dark cycles oscillated in a circadian manner with peaks in the middle of the light period. Under drought stress conditions, OsPIL1 expression was inhibited during the light period. We found that OsPIL1 was highly expressed in the node portions of the stem using promoter-glucuronidase analysis. Overexpression of OsPIL1 in transgenic rice plants promoted internode elongation. In contrast, transgenic rice plants with a chimeric repressor resulted in short internode sections. Alteration of internode cell size was observed in OsPIL1 transgenic plants, indicating that differences in cell size cause the change in internode length. Oligoarray analysis revealed OsPIL1 downstream genes, which were enriched for cell wall-related genes responsible for cell elongation. These data suggest that OsPIL1 functions as a key regulatory factor of reduced plant height via cell wall-related genes in response to drought stress. This regulatory system may be important for morphological stress adaptation in rice under drought conditions.
22993695	Functional integration between defence and IRE1-mediated ER stress response in rice.	2012	Sci Rep	Conditions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) influence most secretory proteins that pass through the ER. Therefore, eukaryotic cells must strike a balance between the ER stress response, which changes the conditions in the ER, and other considerations associated with protein secretion. Here, an interaction between the ER stress and defence responses in rice is described. Expression of OsWRKY45, which encodes a transcription factor that plays a central role in defence mediated by salicylic acid (SA), is induced by ER stress. Additionally, expression of some genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) secretory proteins is reduced by the ER stress response mediated by the stress sensor IRE1. Concomitant activation of the SA and ER stress responses suppresses the induction of ER stress-responsive genes, with the exception of OsWRKY45, and the reduction of PR gene expression. These findings demonstrate a functional integration between the defence and ER stress responses in plants.
22960246	Control of tiller growth of rice by OsSPL14 and Strigolactones, which work in two independent pathways.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The architecture of rice is greatly influenced by the growth of tillers, i.e. vegetative shoot branches. OsSPL14, a member of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes, and strigolactones (SLs) are known to suppress outgrowth of tiller buds. OsSPL14 also regulates panicle development. We show that OsSPL14 mRNA accumulates in leaf primordia during the vegetative phase and in the primordia of bracts, or modified leaves, in the panicles, but not in the meristems. OsSPL14 is a target of miR156, and accumulation of OsSPL14 transcripts is negatively regulated by miR156. The enhancement of the expression level of OsSPL14 by the introduction of the mOsSPL14 gene, in which the miR156 cleavage site is mutated, resulted in an increase in the plastochron, an acceleration of flowering and a decrease in tiller number in the wild type and in dwarf10-2, an SL-deficient mutant. Our analysis suggests that OsSPL14 and SLs function in parallel pathways to suppress tiller growth. SLs exuded from roots trigger germination of root parasitic plants that can cause severe damage to crop productivity. SL-deficient mutants, however, exhibit an excess branching phenotype which is usually undesirable for productivity. Our results indicate that OsSPL14 can be used to manipulate the branching patterns of SL-deficient mutants. We also confirmed that this strategy is applicable to Arabidopsis. A greater understanding of the OsSPL14 and SL pathways and their interactions may help in the production of root parasite-resistant crops.
22973062	LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF.	2013	Mol Plant	Proper flowering time is essential for plant reproduction. Winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana needs vernalization before flowering, during which AtVILs (VIN3 and VRN5, components of PRC2 complex) mediate the H3K27 tri-methylation at the FLC locus (a floral repressor) to repress the FLC expression and hence to induce flowering. However, how VILs (VIL, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE) function in rice is unknown. Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering. Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a. Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification. In addition, OsLF directly regulates the Hd1 expression through binding to Hd1 promoter. These results first demonstrated that the putative PRC2 in rice is involved in photoperiod flowering regulation, which is different from that of Arabidopsis, and revealed that LC2 binds the promoter region of target gene, presenting a possible mechanism of the recruitment process of PRC2 complex to its target genes. The studies provide informative clues on the epigenetic control of rice flowering.
23013464	Nuclear ubiquitin proteasome degradation affects WRKY45 function in the rice defense program.	2013	Plant J	The transcriptional activator WRKY45 plays a major role in the salicylic acid/benzothiadiazole-induced defense program in rice. Here, we show that the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a role in regulating the function of WRKY45. Proteasome inhibitors induced accumulation of polyubiquitinated WRKY45 and transient up-regulation of WRKY45 target genes in rice cells, suggesting that WRKY45 is constantly degraded by the UPS to suppress defense responses in the absence of defense signals. Mutational analysis of the nuclear localization signal indicated that UPS-dependent WRKY45 degradation occurs in the nuclei. Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of WRKY45 after salicylic acid treatment was impaired by proteasome inhibition. The same C-terminal region in WRKY45 was essential for both transcriptional activity and UPS-dependent degradation. These results suggest that UPS regulation also plays a role in the transcriptional activity of WRKY45. It has been reported that AtNPR1, the central regulator of the salicylic acid pathway in Arabidopsis, is regulated by the UPS. We found that OsNPR1/NH1, the rice counterpart of NPR1, was not stabilized by proteasome inhibition under uninfected conditions. We discuss the differences in post-translational regulation of salicylic acid pathway components between rice and Arabidopsis.
22899052	A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The DEAD-box RNA helicase family comprise enzymes that participate in every aspect of RNA metabolism, associated with a diverse range of cellular functions including response to abiotic stress. In the present study, we report on the identification of a new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice which is upregulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments  including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light. It possesses an ORF of 2772 nt, encoding a protein of 923 aa, which contains the DEAD and helicase C-terminal domains, along with the nine conserved motifs specific to DEAD-box helicases. The in silico putative interaction with other proteins showed that OsABP interacts with proteins involved in RNA metabolism, signal transduction or stress response. These results imply that OsABP might perform important functions in the cellular response to specific abiotic stress.
22922198	Transcriptome response to nitrogen starvation in rice.	2012	J Biosci	Nitrogen is an essential mineral nutrient required for plant growth and development. Insufficient nitrogen (N) supply triggers extensive physiological and biochemical changes in plants. In this study, we used Affymetrix GeneChip rice genome arrays to analyse the dynamics of rice transcriptome under N starvation. N starvation induced or suppressed transcription of 3518 genes, representing 10.88 percent of the genome. These changes, mostly transient, affected various cellular metabolic pathways, including stress response, primary and secondary metabolism, molecular transport, regulatory process and organismal development. 462 or 13.1 percent transcripts for N starvation expressed similarly in root and shoot. Comparative analysis between rice and Arabidopsis identified 73 orthologous groups that responded to N starvation, demonstrated the existence of conserved N stress coupling mechanism among plants. Additional analysis of transcription profiles of microRNAs revealed differential expression of miR399 and miR530 under N starvation, suggesting their potential roles in plant nutrient homeostasis.
23028360	Role of transposon-derived small RNAs in the interplay between genomes and parasitic DNA in rice.	2012	PLoS Genet	RNA silencing is a defense system against "genomic parasites" such as transposable elements (TE), which are potentially harmful to host genomes. In plants, transcripts from TEs induce production of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and are processed into small RNAs (small interfering RNAs, siRNAs) that suppress TEs by RNA-directed DNA methylation. Thus, the majority of TEs are epigenetically silenced. On the other hand, most of the eukaryotic genome is composed of TEs and their remnants, suggesting that TEs have evolved countermeasures against host-mediated silencing. Under some circumstances, TEs can become active and increase in copy number. Knowledge is accumulating on the mechanisms of TE silencing by the host; however, the mechanisms by which TEs counteract silencing are poorly understood. Here, we show that a class of TEs in rice produces a microRNA (miRNA) to suppress host silencing. Members of the microRNA820 (miR820) gene family are located within CACTA DNA transposons in rice and target a de novo DNA methyltransferase gene, OsDRM2, one of the components of epigenetic silencing. We confirmed that miR820 negatively regulates the expression of OsDRM2. In addition, we found that expression levels of various TEs are increased quite sensitively in response to decreased OsDRM2 expression and DNA methylation at TE loci. Furthermore, we found that the nucleotide sequence of miR820 and its recognition site within the target gene in some Oryza species have co-evolved to maintain their base-pairing ability. The co-evolution of these sequences provides evidence for the functionality of this regulation. Our results demonstrate how parasitic elements in the genome escape the host's defense machinery. Furthermore, our analysis of the regulation of OsDRM2 by miR820 sheds light on the action of transposon-derived small RNAs, not only as a defense mechanism for host genomes but also as a regulator of interactions between hosts and their parasitic elements.
23226086	Estimation of the outcrossing rate for annual Asian wild rice under field conditions.	2012	Breed Sci	The Asian wild rice, Oryza rufipogon, has partial outcrossing behavior and shows high levels of genetic variation. To estimate an accurate outcrossing rate of annual form of O. rufipogon, two backcross lines (Lines R1 and R2) between Oryza sativa Nipponbare and O. rufipogon W630 were examined under field conditions. A chromosome survey confirmed that these lines had wild chromosomal segments at more than 92% of marker loci. As for the traits of glume, stamen and pistil, Line R1 showed similar floral morphology as that of O. rufipogon W630, whereas Line R2 had larger glumes. In 2005, 2006 and 2008, a total of 22 backcross plants were planted in the middle of wild rice plots. The successive progenies of each plant were examined using microsatellite markers that could clearly detect self-pollination and outcrossing. The outcrossing rates of Line R1 plants ranged from 4.04% to 25.50% with an average of 10.20%. This indicates that cross-pollination of wild rice is a chance event affected by many environmental factors. The outcrossing rates of Line R2 plants also varied, however, no significant difference was observed between the averages of Lines R1 and R2, suggesting that the glume sizes are not critical for outcrossing ability.
23010196	Patterns of cis-element enrichment reveal potential regulatory modules involved in the transcriptional regulation of anoxia response of japonica rice.	2012	Gene	Unlike other cereal species, rice is able to germinate and elongate under anoxia. The regulatory mechanism that configures the transcriptome of rice during anaerobic germination is yet to be established. In this study, the major regulatory modules among anoxia-responsive genes in rice identified from published microarray data were predicted by ab initio analysis of cis-regulatory information content. Statistically overrepresented sequence motifs were detected from bona fide promoter sequences [-1000 to +200], revealing various patterns of cis-element enrichment that are highly correlated with bZIP, ERF and MYB types of transcription factors. As implied by the cis-element enrichment patterns, combinatorial mechanisms configure the overall changes in gene expression during anoxic germination and coleoptile elongation. High enrichment of cis-elements associated with ARF, bZIP, ERF, MYB and WRKY (SUSIBA2) transcription factors was also detected among the glycolytic and fermentative associated genes that were upregulated during anoxia. The patterns established from the global analysis of cis-element distribution for upregulated and downregulated genes and their associations with potential cognate regulatory transcription factors indicate the significant roles of ethylene and abscisic acid mediated signaling during coleoptile elongation under anoxia. In addition, the regulation of genes encoding enzymes in the glycolytic and fermentative metabolism could be associated with abscisic acid and auxin in rice coleoptiles to maintain sugar and ATP levels for longer survival.
23116672	An ornithine δ-aminotransferase gene OsOAT confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice.	2012	Plant Sci	Ornithine δ-aminotransferase (δ-OAT) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that has been proposed to be involved in proline (Pro) and arginine (Arg) metabolism. However, the actual role of δ-OAT in abiotic responses in plants remains to be clarified. Here we characterized an ornithine δ-aminotransferase gene OsOAT that confers multi-stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2. OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments. Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of OsOAT. Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance. Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased δ-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions. In addition, OsOAT-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress. The glutathione (GSH) content and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, were also increased in OsOAT-overexpressing plants. We conclude that OsOAT is a target gene of SNAC2 and confers stress tolerance mainly through enhancing ROS-scavenging capacity and Pro pre-accumulation.
23037947	Characterization of physiological response and identification of associated genes under heat stress in rice seedlings.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Global warming, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, makes food crops more vulnerable to heat stress. Understanding the heat stress-related mechanisms in crops and classifying heat stress-related genes can increase our knowledge in heat-resistant molecular biology and propel developments in molecular design breeding, which can help rice cope with unfavorable temperatures. In this study, we carried out a physiological analysis of rice plants after heat stress. The results show a dramatic increase in malondialdehyde contents and SOD activities. We successfully isolated 11 heat-related rice genes with known function annotation through DNSH, which is an improved SSH method for screening long cDNA fragments. The reanalysis of microarray data from public database revealed that all these genes displayed various expression patterns after heat stress, drought, cold and salt. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was also performed to validate the expression of these genes after heat stress. The expressions in 10 genes were all significantly changed except for contig 77, which is a CBL-interacting protein kinase. Several reports have been published about the members of the same gene family.
23024799	OsLEA3-2, an abiotic stress induced gene of rice plays a key role in salt and drought tolerance.	2012	PLoS One	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are involved in tolerance to drought, cold and high salinity in many different organisms. In this report, a LEA protein producing full-length gene OsLEA3-2 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa) using the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) method. OsLEA3-2 was found to be only expressed in the embryo and can be induced by abiotic stresses. The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3-2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt- and osmotic-stress conditions. OsLEA3-2 was also inserted into pHB vector and overexpressed in Arabidopsis and rice. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings showed better growth on MS media supplemented with 150 mM mannitol or 100 mM NaCl as compared with wild type plants. The transgenic rice also showed significantly stronger growth performance than control under salinity or osmotic stress conditions and were able to recover after 20 days of drought stress. In vitro analysis showed that OsLEA3-2 was able to protect LDH from aggregation on freezing and inactivation on desiccation. These results indicated that OsLEA3-2 plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses.
23024213	RNA-directed DNA methylation is involved in regulating photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice.	2012	Mol Plant	Photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) is a valuable germplasm for hybrid rice breeding. Recently, we cloned pms3, a locus controlling PSMS, which encodes a long non-coding RNA called LDMAR required for normal male fertility of the rice plant under long-day conditions. Increased methylation in the promoter of LDMAR in the PSMS rice (Nongken 58S) relative to the wild-type (Nongken 58) reduced expression of LDMAR leading to male sterility under long-day conditions. In this study, we identified a siRNA named Psi-LDMAR in the LDMAR promoter region that was more abundant in Nongken 58S than in Nongken 58. We showed that Psi-LDMAR was likely derived from AK111270, a transcript obtained from the sense strand of the LDMAR promoter with its 3'-end having a 110-base overlap with the 5'-end of LDMAR. Overexpressing AK111270 in Nongken 58S greatly enriched Psi-LDMAR, which induced RNA-directed DNA methylation in the LDMAR promoter and repressed the expression of LDMAR. Reduction of LDMAR in Nongken 58S changed the critical day length for fertility recovery and delayed the fertility recovery under short-day conditions. This result added to our understanding of the molecular mechanism for PSMS.
22947243	Constitutive expression of transgenes encoding derivatives of the synthetic antimicrobial peptide BP100: impact on rice host plant fitness.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Biopeptide BP100 is a synthetic and strongly cationic α-helical undecapeptide with high, specific antibacterial activity against economically important plant-pathogenic bacteria, and very low toxicity. It was selected from a library of synthetic peptides, along with other peptides with activities against relevant bacterial and fungal species. Expression of the BP100 series of peptides in plants is of major interest to establish disease-resistant plants and facilitate molecular farming. Specific challenges were the small length, peptide degradation by plant proteases and toxicity to the host plant. Here we approached the expression of the BP100 peptide series in plants using BP100 as a proof-of-concept.

RESULTS: Our design considered up to three tandemly arranged BP100 units and peptide accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), analyzing five BP100 derivatives. The ER retention sequence did not reduce the antimicrobial activity of chemically synthesized BP100 derivatives, making this strategy possible. Transformation with sequences encoding BP100 derivatives (bp100der) was over ten-fold less efficient than that of the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) transgene. The BP100 direct tandems did not show higher antimicrobial activity than BP100, and genetically modified (GM) plants constitutively expressing them were not viable. In contrast, inverted repeats of BP100, whether or not elongated with a portion of a natural antimicrobial peptide (AMP), had higher antimicrobial activity, and fertile GM rice lines constitutively expressing bp100der were produced. These GM lines had increased resistance to the pathogens Dickeya chrysanthemi and Fusarium verticillioides, and tolerance to oxidative stress, with agronomic performance comparable to untransformed lines.

CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive expression of transgenes encoding short cationic α-helical synthetic peptides can have a strong negative impact on rice fitness. However, GM plants expressing, for example, BP100 based on inverted repeats, have adequate agronomic performance and resistant phenotypes as a result of a complex equilibrium between bp100der toxicity to plant cells, antimicrobial activity and transgene-derived plant stress response. It is likely that these results can be extended to other peptides with similar characteristics.
22960619	Different isoforms of starch-synthesizing enzymes controlling amylose and amylopectin content in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	None	Biotechnol Adv	Starch, composed of amylose and amylopectin, greatly influences rice cooking and textural quality, which in turn is controlled by various isoforms of several enzymes. Activity of one or more isoforms of starch-synthesizing enzymes results in various forms of starch structure based on the amylopectin chain length and average external, internal and core chain length distribution and hence results in varying physicochemical and cooking quality. Since the synthesis of starch is highly complex, it is crucial but essential to understand its biosynthetic pathway, starch structure and effects on the physicochemical properties that control eating and cooking quality, and alongside conduct research on gene/QTL mapping for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS) with a view to improve and select cultivars with most desirable range and class of rice starch properties. This article presents the updates on current understanding of the coordination among various enzymes/isoforms towards rice starch synthesis in endosperm and their effect on rice grain physicochemical, cooking and eating qualities. The efforts in identifying regions responsible for these enzymes by mapping the gene/QTLs have provided a glimpse on their association with physicochemical and cooking properties of rice and, hence, improvement is possible by modifying the allelic pattern, resulting in down or nil regulation of a particular enzyme. The clear understanding of the tissue specific coordination between enzyme isoforms and their subsequent effect in controlling eating and cooking properties will enhance the chances to manipulate them for getting desired range of amylose content (AC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) in improved cultivars through combining desired alleles through MAS.
22947050	Serpins in rice: protein sequence analysis, phylogeny and gene expression during development.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Most members of the serpin family of proteins are potent, irreversible inhibitors of specific serine or cysteine proteinases. Inhibitory serpins are distinguished from members of other families of proteinase inhibitors by their metastable structure and unique suicide-substrate mechanism. Animal serpins exert control over a remarkable diversity of physiological processes including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, innate immunity and aspects of development. Relatively little is known about the complement of serpin genes in plant genomes and the biological functions of plant serpins.

RESULTS: A structurally refined amino-acid sequence alignment of the 14 full-length serpins encoded in the genome of the japonica rice Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare (a monocot) showed a diversity of reactive-centre sequences (which largely determine inhibitory specificity) and a low degree of identity with those of serpins in Arabidopsis (a eudicot). A new convenient and functionally informative nomenclature for plant serpins in which the reactive-centre sequence is incorporated into the serpin name was developed and applied to the rice serpins. A phylogenetic analysis of the rice serpins provided evidence for two main clades and a number of relatively recent gene duplications. Transcriptional analysis showed vastly different levels of basal expression among eight selected rice serpin genes in callus tissue, during seedling development, among vegetative tissues of mature plants and throughout seed development. The gene OsSRP-LRS (Os03g41419), encoding a putative orthologue of Arabidopsis AtSerpin1 (At1g47710), was expressed ubiquitously and at high levels. The second most highly expressed serpin gene was OsSRP-PLP (Os11g11500), encoding a non-inhibitory serpin with a surprisingly well-conserved reactive-centre loop (RCL) sequence among putative orthologues in other grass species.

CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of reactive-centre sequences among the putatively inhibitory serpins of rice point to a range of target proteases with different proteolytic specificities. Large differences in basal expression levels of the eight selected rice serpin genes during development further suggest a range of functions in regulation and in plant defence for the corresponding proteins.
22960759	Reduction of 13 kD prolamins increases recombinant protein yield and recovery rate in rice endosperm.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	RNA silencing inducible sequence (RSIS) causes post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of 5' or 3' flanking sequence-containing genes by inhibiting proper transcriptional termination. Exploiting this nature, 13 kD Pro-less, in which major seed storage protein (SSP) 13 kD prolamins are reduced, has been generated. In 13 kD Pro-less, other SSPs, such as glutelins, are increased as a compensation effect to maintain amino acid pool. 7Crp is the seven-linked epitope peptide derived from major cedar pollen allergens Cry j 1 and Cry j 2. When 7Crp is expressed in 13 kD Pro-less endosperm, accumulation level of 7Crp increased. Furthermore, recovery rate of 7Crp without reducing reagent increased. These findings indicate that 13 kD Pro-less endosperm provides a good production platform for recombinant proteins.
22899049	Alanine: Glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 is required for mobilization and utilization of triglycerides during infection process of the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae has been widely used as a model pathogen to study plant infection-related fungal morphogenesis, such as penetration via appressorium and plant-microbe interactions at the molecular level. Previously, we identified a gene encoding peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1) in M. oryzae and demonstrated that the AGT1 was indispensable for pathogenicity. The AGT1 knockout mutants were unable to penetrate the host plants, such as rice and barley, and therefore were non-pathogenic. The inability of ∆Moagt1 mutants to penetrate the susceptible plants was likely due to the disruption in coordination of the β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle resulted from a blockage in lipid droplet mobilization and eventually utilization during conidial germination and appressorium morphogenesis, respectively. Here, we further demonstrate the role of AGT1 in lipid mobilization by in vitro germination assays and confocal microscopy.
23053539	Young Leaf Chlorosis 1, a chloroplast-localized gene required for chlorophyll and lutein accumulation during early leaf development in rice.	2013	Planta	Chlorophyll (Chl) and lutein are the two most abundant and essential components in photosynthetic apparatus, and play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant named young leaf chlorosis 1 (ylc1) from a ⁶⁰Co-irradiated population. Young leaves of the ylc1 mutant showed decreased levels of Chl and lutein compared to those of wild type, and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the thylakoid lamellar structures were obviously loosely arranged. Whereas, the mutant turns green gradually and approaches normal green at the maximum tillering stage. The Young Leaf Chlorosis 1 (YLC1) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a protein of unknown function belonging to the DUF3353 superfamily. Complementation and RNA-interference tests confirmed the role of the YLC1 gene, which expressed in all tested rice tissues, especially in the leaves. Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures. In rice protoplasts, the YLC1 protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern. The N-terminal 50 amino acid residues were confirmed to be necessary and sufficient for chloroplast targeting. These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice.
22994911	Genomic dissection of small RNAs in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon): lessons for rice domestication.	2012	New Phytol	The lack of a MIRNA set and genome sequence of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) has prevented us from determining the role of MIRNA genes in rice domestication. In this study, a genome, three small RNA populations and a degradome of O. rufipogon were sequenced by Illumina platform and the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) were investigated by miRNA chips. A de novo O. rufipogon genome was assembled using c. 55× coverage of raw sequencing data and a total of 387 MIRNAs were identified in the O. rufipogon genome based on c. 5.2 million unique small RNA reads from three different tissues of O. rufipogon. Of these, O. rufipogon MIRNAs, 259 were not found in the cultivated rice, suggesting a loss of these MIRNAs in the cultivated rice. We also found that 48 MIRNAs were novel in the cultivated rice, suggesting that they were potential targets of domestication selection. Some miRNAs showed significant expression differences between wild and cultivated rice, suggesting that expression of miRNA could also be a target of domestication, as demonstrated for the miR164 family. Our results illustrated that MIRNA genes, like protein-coding genes, might have been significantly shaped during rice domestication and could be one of the driving forces that contributed to rice domestication.
23019369	Genetic composition of yield heterosis in an elite rice hybrid.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Heterosis refers to the superior performance of hybrids relative to the parents. Utilization of heterosis has contributed tremendously to the increased productivity in many crops for decades. Although there have been a range of studies on various aspects of heterosis, the key to understanding the biological mechanisms of heterotic performance in crop hybrids is the genetic basis, much of which is still uncharacterized. In this study, we dissected the genetic composition of yield and yield component traits using data of replicated field trials of an "immortalized F(2)" population derived from an elite rice hybrid. On the basis of an ultrahigh-density SNP bin map constructed with population sequencing, we calculated single-locus and epistatic genetic effects in the whole genome and identified components pertaining to heterosis of the hybrid. The results showed that the relative contributions of the genetic components varied with traits. Overdominance/pseudo-overdominance is the most important contributor to heterosis of yield, number of grains per panicle, and grain weight. Dominance × dominance interaction is important for heterosis of tillers per plant and grain weight and has roles in yield and grain number. Single-locus dominance has relatively small contributions in all of the traits. The results suggest that cumulative effects of these components may adequately explain the genetic basis of heterosis in the hybrid.
22968716	HDT701, a histone H4 deacetylase, negatively regulates plant innate immunity by modulating histone H4 acetylation of defense-related genes in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	Histone acetylation and deacetylation play an important role in the modification of chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Chromatin acetylation status is modulated antagonistically by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study, we characterized the function of histone deacetylase701 (HDT701), a member of the plant-specific HD2 subfamily of HDACs, in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity. Transcription of HDT701 is increased in the compatible reaction and decreased in the incompatible reaction after infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of HDT701 in transgenic rice leads to decreased levels of histone H4 acetylation and enhanced susceptibility to the rice pathogens M. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). By contrast, silencing of HDT701 in transgenic rice causes elevated levels of histone H4 acetylation and elevated transcription of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and defense-related genes, increased generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen-associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, as well as enhanced resistance to both M. oryzae and Xoo. We also found that HDT701 can bind to defense-related genes to regulate their expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HDT701 negatively regulates innate immunity by modulating the levels of histone H4 acetylation of PRR and defense-related genes in rice.
23029003	Biofortification and bioavailability of rice grain zinc as affected by different forms of foliar zinc fertilization.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Zinc (Zn) biofortification through foliar Zn application is an attractive strategy to reduce human Zn deficiency. However, little is known about the biofortification efficiency and bioavailability of rice grain from different forms of foliar Zn fertilizers.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four different Zn forms were applied as a foliar treatment among three rice cultivars under field trial. Zinc bioavailability was assessed by in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model. Foliar Zn fertilization was an effective agronomic practice to promote grain Zn concentration and Zn bioavailability among three rice cultivars, especially, in case of Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4). On average, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) increased Zn concentration in polished rice up to 24.04% and 22.47%, respectively. On average, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) increased Zn bioavailability in polished rice up to 68.37% and 64.43%, respectively. The effectiveness of foliar applied Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) were higher than Zn-EDTA and Zn-Citrate on improvement of Zn concentration, and reduction of phytic acid, as a results higher accumulation of bioavailable Zn in polished rice. Moreover, foliar Zn application could maintain grain yield, the protein and minerals (Fe and Ca) quality of the polished rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Foliar application of Zn in rice offers a practical and useful approach to improve bioavailable Zn in polished rice. According to current study, Zn-amino acid and ZnSO(4) are recommended as excellent foliar Zn forms to ongoing agronomic biofortification.
23079822	Identification of quantitative trait loci for blast resistance in BC₂F₃ and BC₂F5 advanced backcross families of rice.	2012	Genet Mol Res	Advanced backcross families derived from Oryza sativa cv MR219/O. rufipogon IRGC105491 were utilized for identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for blast resistance using simple sequence repeat markers. Two hundred and sixty-one BC(2)F(3) families were used to construct a linkage map, using 87 markers, which covered 2375.2 cM of 12 rice chromosomes, with a mean density of 27.3 cM. The families were evaluated in a greenhouse for resistance to blast disease caused by pathotypes P7.2 and P5.0 of Magnaporthe oryzae. Five QTLs (qBL5.1, qBL5.2, qBL6.1, qBL8.1, and qBL10.1) for pathotype P5.0 and four QTLs (qBL5.3, qBL5.4, qBL7.1, and qBL8.2) for pathotype P7.2 were identified using the BC(2)F(3) families. Another linkage map was also constructed based on 31 BC(2)F(5) families, using 63 SSR markers, which covered 474.9 cM of 9 rice chromosomes, with a mean density of 8.01 cM. Five suggestive QTLs (qBL11.2, qBL11.3, qBL12.1, qBL12.2, qBL12.3) and one putative QTL (qBL2.1) were identified for pathotype P7.2. Also, seven suggestive QTLs (qBL1.1, qBL2.2, qBL4.1, qBL4.2, qBL5.3, qBL8.3, and qBL11.1) were detected for pathotype P5.0. We conclude that there is a non-race-specific resistance spectrum of O. rufipogon against M. oryzae pathotypes.
22970151	Ectopic expression of Hrf1 enhances bacterial resistance via regulation of diterpene phytoalexins, silicon and reactive oxygen species burst in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Harpin proteins as elicitor derived from plant gram negative bacteria such as Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), Erwinia amylovora induce disease resistance in plants by activating multiple defense responses. However, it is unclear whether phytoalexin production and ROS burst are involved in the disease resistance conferred by the expression of the harpin(Xoo) protein in rice. In this article, ectopic expression of hrf1 in rice enhanced resistance to bacterial blight. Accompanying with the activation of genes related to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway in hrf1-transformed rice, phytoalexins quickly and consistently accumulated concurrent with the limitation of bacterial growth rate. Moreover, the hrf1-transformed rice showed an increased ability for ROS scavenging and decreased hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) concentration. Furthermore, the localization and relative quantification of silicon deposition in rice leaves was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Finally, the transcript levels of defense response genes increased in transformed rice. These results show a correlation between Xoo resistance and phytoalexin production, H(2)O(2), silicon deposition and defense gene expression in hrf1-transformed rice. These data are significant because they provide evidence for a better understanding the role of defense responses in the incompatible interaction between bacterial disease and hrf1-transformed plants. These data also supply an opportunity for generating nonspecific resistance to pathogens.
23240408	[Determination of translocatable matter of rice by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy].	2012	Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi	The potential of predicting translocatable matter of rice with near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was studied. Using 7 varieties of rice planted in Danzhou of Hainan province as materials, the method of neutral detergent fiber added amylase with NIRS was examined to establish calibration model of predicting translocatable matter of stem and panicle of rice. The results indicated that partial least square(PLS1) is the best regression statistic method for calibration model; The differences of results of the spectral data pretreatment methods for calibration model were insignificant; Because of the high prediction accuracy, the final calibration model was chosen using "no spectral data pretreatment" + "PLS1"; Determination coefficient of external validation and root mean square errors of prediction of the calibration model of stem and panicle was 0.991 2, 0.008 1, 0.961 1 and 0.022 6, respectively.
23089365	Molecular evolution of the TAC1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	J Genet Genomics	Tiller angle is a key feature of the architecture of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), since it determines planting density and influences rice yield. Our previous work identified Tiller Angle Control 1 (TAC1) as a major quantitative trait locus that controls rice tiller angle. To further clarify the evolutionary characterization of the TAC1 gene, we compared a TAC1-containing 3164-bp genomic region among 113 cultivated varieties and 48 accessions of wild rice, including 43 accessions of O. rufipogon and five accessions of O. nivara. Only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a synonymous substitution, was detected in TAC1 coding regions of the cultivated rice varieties, whereas one synonymous and one nonsynonymous SNP were detected among the TAC1 coding regions of wild rice accessions. These data indicate that little natural mutation and modification in the TAC1 coding region occurred within the cultivated rice and its progenitor during evolution. Nucleotide diversities in the TAC1 gene regions of O. sativa and O. rufipogon of 0.00116 and 0.00112, respectively, further indicate that TAC1 has been highly conserved during the course of rice domestication. A functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) of TAC1 was only found in the japonica rice group. A neutrality test revealed strong selection, especially in the 3'-flanking region of the TAC1 coding region containing the FNP in the japonica rice group. However, no selection occurred in the indica and wild-rice groups. A phylogenetic tree derived from TAC1 sequence analysis suggests that the indica and japonica subspecies arose independently during the domestication of wild rice.
22972350	Search for cell-wall-degrading enzymes of world-wide rice grains by PCR and their effects on the palatability of rice.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Such rice cultivars as Japonica, Japonica-Indica hybrid, Javanica and Indica, were evaluated for their main chemical components (amylose content and protein content), pasting property of rice flour (consistency), physical property of the cooked rice grains (adhesion, L3), and enzyme activities (cellulase and xylanase). The amylose content, cellulase activity and xylanase activity showed significant positive or negative correlation with the pasting property (consistency) of rice flour (r = 0.89, r = 0.58, r = 0.70, respectively) and with the physical property of the cooked rice grains (adhesion, L3: r = -0.51, r = -0.61, r = -0.71, respectively) at the level of 1%. Endogenous xylanase and cellulase played important roles to determine the texture of the cooked rice grains similarly to the amylose content. Part of the DNA sequences of the α-glucosidase gene differed among the Japonica, Japonica-Indica hybrid and Indica subspecies. We found discriminative DNA bands appearing by PCR, corresponding to 1,4-β-xylanase and endo-1,4-β-glucanase 13 in the case of Indica rice, Indica-Japonica hybrid rice, and Javanica rice (non-Japonica subspecies). The equation for estimating the physical property (adhesion) of cooked rice grains by PCR was improved by adding novel primers related to the cell-wall-degrading enzymes.
22926745	Reactive oxygen species, ascorbate-glutathione pool, and enzymes of their metabolism in drought-sensitive and tolerant indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings subjected to progressing levels of water deficit.	2013	Protoplasma	Water deficit for rice is a worldwide concern, and to produce drought-tolerant varieties, it is essential to elucidate molecular mechanisms associated with water deficit tolerance. In the present study, we investigated the differential responses of nonenzymatic antioxidants ascorbate (AsA), glutathione (GSH), and their redox pool as well as activity levels of enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle in seedlings of drought-sensitive rice (Oryza sativa L.) cv. Malviya-36 and drought-tolerant cv. Brown Gora subjected to water deficit treatment of -1.0 and -2.1 MPa for 24-72 h using PEG-6000 in sand cultures. Water deficit caused increased production of reactive oxygen species such as O2[Symbol: see text](-), H2O2, and HO[Symbol: see text] in the tissues, and the level of production was higher in the sensitive than the tolerant cultivar. Water deficit caused reduction in AsA and GSH and decline in their redox ratios (AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG) with lesser decline in tolerant than the sensitive seedlings. With progressive level of water deficit, the activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione transferase increased in the seedlings of both rice cultivars, but the increased activity levels were higher in the seedlings of drought-tolerant cv. Brown Gora compared to the sensitive cv. Malviya-36. Greater accumulation of proline was observed in stressed seedlings of tolerant than the sensitive cultivar. In-gel activity staining of APX revealed varying numbers of their isoforms and their differential expression in sensitive and tolerant seedlings under water deficit. Results suggest that an enhanced oxidative stress tolerance by a well-coordinated cellular redox state of ascorbate and glutathione in reduced forms and induction of antioxidant defense system by elevated activity levels of enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle is associated with water deficit tolerance in rice.
22902687	Roles of the Arabidopsis G protein γ subunit AGG3 and its rice homologs GS3 and DEP1 in seed and organ size control.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The size of seeds and organs is coordinately determined by cell proliferation and cell expansion, but the mechanisms that set final seed and organ size are largely unknown in plants. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that the plant specific G protein γ subunit (AGG3) promotes seed and organ growth by increasing the period of proliferative growth in Arabidopsis. AGG3 is localized in plasma membrane and interacts with the G protein β subunit (AGB1). Homologs of AGG3 in rice (GS3 and DEP1/qPE9-1) have been identified as important quantitative trait loci for seed size and yield. However, rice GS3 and DEP1 influence seed and organ growth by restricting cell proliferation. Here, we discuss the possible molecular mechanisms by which Arabidopsis AGG3 and its rice homologs GS3 and DEP1 control seed and organ size.
22994594	Unravelling mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the abiotic stress induction of rice ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1 genes.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) is the transduction of mitochondrial signals to mediate nuclear gene expression. It is not clear whether MRR is a common regulation mechanism in plant abiotic stress response. In this study, we analysed the early abiotic stress response of the rice OsAOX1 genes, and the induction of OsAOX1a and OsAOX1b (OsAOX1a/b) was selected as a working model for the stress-induced MRR studies. We found that the induction mediated by the superoxide ion (O2·(-) )-generating chemical methyl viologen was stronger than that of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). The addition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers demonstrated that the stress induction was reduced by eliminating O2·(-) . Furthermore, the stress induction did not rely on chloroplast- or cytosol-derived O2·(-) . Next, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene at different subcellular locations. The results suggest that only the mitochondrial SOD, OsMSD, attenuated the stress induction of OsAOX1a/b specifically. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that abiotic stress initiates the MRR on OsAOX1a/b and that mitochondrial O2·(-) is involved in the process.
23175467	Pyramiding and evaluation of three dominant brown planthopper resistance genes in the elite indica rice 9311 and its hybrids.	2013	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, is the most devastating insect pest in rice-producing areas. Three dominant BPH resistance genes (Bph14, Bph15, Bph18) were pyramided into elite indica rice 9311 and its hybrids using marker-assisted selection. Gene effectiveness was evaluated on the basis of seedling and adult rice resistance, honeydew weight and survival rate of BPH.

RESULTS: All three genes affected BPH growth and development and antibiotic factors, resulting in both seedling and adult resistance. Bph15 had the greatest effect on conferring resistance to BPH. The results showed an additive effect of pyramiding genes, the order of the gene effect being 14/15/18 ≥ 14/15 > 15/18 ≥ 15 > 14/18 ≥ 14 ≥ 18 > none. The pyramided or single-gene introgression hybrids showed greater resistance than conventional hybrids, although the heterozygous genotypes had weaker effects than the corresponding homozygous genotypes. Furthermore, field trial data demonstrated that yields of improved 9311 lines were higher than or similar to that of the control under natural field conditions. These improved versions can be immediately used in hybrid improvement and production.

CONCLUSION: Compared with controls, pyramided lines and hybrids with three genes showed the strongest resistance to BPH, without a yield decrease.
23031077	Transgenic rice with inducible ethylene production exhibits broad-spectrum disease resistance to the fungal pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) are the two most devastating diseases of rice (Oryza sativa), and have severe impacts on crop yield and grain quality. Recent evidence suggests that ethylene (ET) may play a more prominent role than salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in mediating rice disease resistance. In this study, we attempt to genetically manipulate endogenous ET levels in rice for enhancing resistance to rice blast and sheath blight diseases. Transgenic lines with inducible production of ET were generated by expressing the rice ACS2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase, a key enzyme of ET biosynthesis) transgene under control of a strong pathogen-inducible promoter. In comparison with the wild-type plant, the OsACS2-overexpression lines showed significantly increased levels of the OsACS2 transcripts, endogenous ET and defence gene expression, especially in response to pathogen infection. More importantly, the transgenic lines exhibited increased resistance to a field isolate of R. solani, as well as different races of M. oryzae. Assessment of the growth rate, generational time and seed production revealed little or no differences between wild type and transgenic lines. These results suggest that pathogen-inducible production of ET in transgenic rice can enhance resistance to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens without negatively impacting crop productivity.
23053198	Genome-wide identification of rice class I metallothionein gene: tissue expression patterns and induction in response to heavy metal stress.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Metallothioneins (MTs) are members of a family of cysteine-rich low molecular weight polypeptides which play an important role in heavy metal detoxification and homeostasis of intracellular metal ions in plant. Though MT genes from some selected plants have been characterized with respect to their protein sequences, kinetic properties and tissue-specific localization, no detailed study has been carried out in rice. Here, we present genome-wide identification, structural and expression analyses of rice MT gene family. Our analysis suggests presence of 11 class I MT genes in rice genome (Release 7 of the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project) which are differentially expressed during growth and development, in various tissues and during biotic and abiotic stresses. Our analyses suggest that class I MT proteins in rice differ in tissue localization as well as in heavy metal coordination chemistry. We also suggest that some MTs have a predominant role in detoxification of As (V) in arsenic-tolerant rice cultivars. Our analysis suggests that apart from transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional alternative splicing in some members of this family takes place during growth and development, in various tissues and during biotic and abiotic stresses.
23109182	Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Oshox22 belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) family I of transcription factors, most of which have unknown functions. Here we show that the expression of Oshox22 is strongly induced by salt stress, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatment (PEG), and weakly by cold stress. Trans-activation assays in yeast and transient expression analyses in rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox22 is able to bind the CAAT(G/C)ATTG element and acts as a transcriptional activator that requires both the HD and Zip domains. Rice plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox22 showed reduced Oshox22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage. In contrast, transgenic rice over-expressing Oshox22 showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA content, and decreased drought and salt tolerances. Based on these results, we conclude that Oshox22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA-mediated signal transduction pathways.
23202939	Pyrosequencing-based transcriptome analysis of the asian rice gall midge reveals differential response during compatible and incompatible interaction.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	The Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae) is a major pest responsible for immense loss in rice productivity. Currently, very little knowledge exists with regard to this insect at the molecular level. The present study was initiated with the aim of developing molecular resources as well as identifying alterations at the transcriptome level in the gall midge maggots that are in a compatible (SH) or in an incompatible interaction (RH) with their rice host. Roche 454 pyrosequencing strategy was used to develop both transcriptomics and genomics resources that led to the identification of 79,028 and 85,395 EST sequences from gall midge biotype 4 (GMB4) maggots feeding on a susceptible and resistant rice variety, TN1 (SH) and Suraksha (RH), respectively. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the maggots in SH and RH revealed over-representation of transcripts from proteolysis and protein phosphorylation in maggots from RH. In contrast, over-representation of transcripts for translation, regulation of transcription and transcripts involved in electron transport chain were observed in maggots from SH. This investigation, besides unveiling various mechanisms underlying insect-plant interactions, will also lead to a better understanding of strategies adopted by insects in general, and the Asian rice gall midge in particular, to overcome host defense.
23070303	Regulation of glutamine synthetase isoforms in two differentially drought-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars under water deficit conditions.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : The regulation of GS isoforms by WD was organ specific. Two GS isoforms i.e. OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 were differentially regulated in IR-64 (drought-sensitive) and Khitish (drought-tolerant) cultivars of rice. Water deficit (WD) has adverse effect on rice (Oryza sativa L.) and acclimation requires essential reactions of primary metabolism to continue. Rice plants utilize ammonium as major nitrogen source, which is assimilated into glutamine by the reaction of Glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2). Rice plants possess one gene (OsGS2) for chloroplastic GS2 and three genes (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) for cytosolic GS1. Here, we report the effect of WD on regulation of GS isoforms in drought-sensitive (cv. IR-64) and drought-tolerant (cv. Khitish) rice cultivars. Under WD, total GS activity in root and leaf decreased significantly in IR-64 seedlings in comparison to Khitish seedlings. The reduced GS activity in IR-64 leaf was mainly due to decrease in GS2 activity, which correlated with decrease in corresponding transcript and polypeptide contents. GS1 transcript and polypeptide accumulated in leaf during WD, however, GS1 activity was maintained at a constant level. Total GS activity in stem of both the varieties was insensitive to WD. Among GS1 genes, OsGS1;1 expression was differently regulated by WD in the two rice varieties. Its transcript accumulated more abundantly in IR-64 leaf than in Khitish leaf. Following WD, OsGS1;1 mRNA level in stem and root tissues declined in IR-64 and enhanced in Khitish. A steady OsGS1;2 expression patterns were noted in leaf, stem and root of both the cultivars. Results suggest that OsGS2 and OsGS1;1 expression may contribute to drought tolerance of Khitish cultivar under WD conditions.
23104764	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants. Here, we report the importance of JA signaling in the defense system of rice. Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA. OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner. OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer. JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the JA-dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsJAZ8ΔC, which lacks the Jas domain, exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype. A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8ΔC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice. Furthermore, OsJAZ8ΔC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice. On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.
23072989	The role of heavy-metal ATPases, HMAs, in zinc and cadmium transport in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The P(1B)-type heavy metal ATPases (HMAs) are diverse in terms of tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and metal specificity. Functional studies of HMAs have shown that these transporters can be divided into two subgroups based on their metal-substrate specificity: a copper (Cu)/silver (Ag) group and a zinc (Zn)/cobalt (Co)/cadmium (Cd)/lead (Pb) group. Studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and metal hyperaccumulator plants indicate that HMAs play an important role in the translocation or detoxification of Zn and Cd in plants. Rice possesses nine HMA genes, of which OsHMA1-OsHMA3 belong to the Zn/Co/Cd/Pb subgroup. OsHMA2 plays an important role in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd, and participates in Zn and Cd transport to developing seeds in rice. OsHMA3 transports Cd and plays a role in the sequestration of Cd into vacuoles in root cells. Modification of the expression of these genes might be an effective approach for reducing the Cd concentration in rice grains.
23048127	Elongated phytoglycogen chain length in transgenic rice endosperm expressing active starch synthase IIa affects the altered solubility and crystallinity of the storage α-glucan.	2012	J Exp Bot	The relationship between the solubility, crystallinity, and length of the unit chains of plant storage α-glucan was investigated by manipulating the chain length of α-glucans accumulated in a rice mutant. Transgenic lines were produced by introducing a cDNA for starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) from an indica cultivar (SSIIa (I), coding for active SSIIa) into an isoamylase1 (ISA1)-deficient mutant (isa1) that was derived from a japonica cultivar (bearing inactive SSIIa proteins). The water-soluble fraction accounted for >95% of the total α-glucan in the isa1 mutant, whereas it was only 35-70% in the transgenic SSIIa (I)/isa1 lines. Thus, the α-glucans from the SSIIa (I)/isa1 lines were fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions prior to the following characterizations. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a weak B-type crystallinity for the α-glucans of the insoluble fraction, while no crystallinity was confirmed for α-glucans in isa1. Concerning the degree of polymerization (DP) ≤30, the chain lengths of these α-glucans differed significantly in the order of SSIIa (I)/isa1 insoluble > SSIIa (I)/isa1 soluble > α-glucans in isa1. The amount of long chains with DP ≥33 was higher in the insoluble fraction α-glucans than in the other two α-glucans. No difference was observed in the chain length distributions of the β-amylase limit dextrins among these α-glucans. These results suggest that in the SSIIa (I)/isa1 transgenic lines, the unit chains of α-glucans were elongated by SSIIa(I), whereas the expression of SSIIa(I) did not affect the branch positions. Thus, the observed insolubility and crystallinity of the insoluble fraction can be attributed to the elongated length of the outer chains due to SSIIa(I).
23122336	A systematic view of rice heat shock transcription factor family using phylogenomic analysis.	2013	J Plant Physiol	The heat shock transcription factor (Hsf) family includes key regulators of the physiological response to heat stress. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the Hsf family in rice using a phylogenomics-based approach that integrates multi-omics data into the context of a phylogenetic tree. For 25 previously identified Hsfs, we integrated anatomical meta-profiling data from 983 Affymetrix arrays into a phylogenetic tree, revealing a global view of the functional redundancy within this family. Interestingly, most of the Hsfs showed significant fluctuation in gene expression patterns, suggesting that they have condition- or stress-dependent roles. Therefore, we further analyzed the abiotic stress responses of the Hsfs using log(2-)fold change data in response to heat, cold, drought and salt stresses. Subsequently, we identified 19 Hsfs that are positively associated with heat stress, 11 with drought, 9 with salt, and 7 with cold stress, as indicated by at least a 2-fold change and coefficient of variation less than 1. The Hsf subfamily A2 was conserved in the heat stress response. The Hsf subfamily C showed a strong positive association with drought, salt and cold stresses. Downregulation of three members in the Hsf subfamily B in response to cold stress is characteristic. More interestingly, half of the Hsf subfamily B genes were upregulated by heat, drought and salt stresses, while one gene in the other half was downregulated by drought, salt, and cold stresses. Finally, we developed a hypothetical functional gene network mediated by OsHsfA2e/OsHsf-12 that is involved in thermotolerance as well as upregulated in response to heat. We expect that our data will help researchers design more efficient strategies to study the rice Hsf family with information about probable functional redundancy.
23093362	Knockdown of a rice stelar nitrate transporter alters long-distance translocation but not root influx.	2012	Plant Physiol	Root nitrate uptake is well known to adjust to the plant's nitrogen demand for growth. Long-distance transport and/or root storage pools are thought to provide negative feedback signals regulating root uptake. We have characterized a vascular specific nitrate transporter belonging to the high-affinity Nitrate Transporter2 (NRT2) family, OsNRT2.3a, in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare'). Localization analyses using protoplast expression, in planta promoter-β-glucuronidase assay, and in situ hybridization showed that OsNRT2.3a was located in the plasma membrane and mainly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of the stele of nitrate-supplied roots. Knockdown expression of OsNRT2.3a by RNA interference (RNAi) had impaired xylem loading of nitrate and decreased plant growth at low (0.5 mm) nitrate supply. In comparison with the wild type, the RNAi lines contained both nitrate and total nitrogen significantly higher in the roots and lower in the shoots. The short-term [(15)N]NO(3)(-) influx (5 min) in entire roots and NO(3)(-) fluxes in root surfaces showed that the knockdown of OsNRT2.3a in comparison with the wild type did not affect nitrate uptake by roots. The RNAi plants showed no significant changes in the expression of some root nitrate transporters (OsNRT2.3b, OsNRT2.4, and OsNAR2.1), but transcripts for nia1 (nitrate reductase) had increased and OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 had decreased when the plants were supplied with nitrate. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNRT2.3a plays a key role in long-distance nitrate transport from root to shoot at low nitrate supply level in rice.
23061987	A salicylic acid-induced rice (Oryza sativa L.) transcription factor OsWRKY77 is involved in disease resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana.	2013	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Plant WRKY transcription factors act as either positive or negative regulators of plant basal disease resistance. To comprehensively characterise the complicated functional network, we isolated OsWRKY77 from rice seedlings treated with salicylic acid. OsWRKY77 is a typical WRKY transcription factor, based on in its protein structure analysis, nuclear localisation of the fused OsWRKY77-GFP protein and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding, which demonstrated that OsWRKY77 was able to bind a W-box. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing OsWRKY77 repressed growth of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PstDC300), and the reduced susceptibility was associated with enhanced expression of defence-related PR1, PR2 and PR5 genes. These results show that OsWRKY77 is a positive regulator of PR gene expression and basal resistance to the bacterial pathogen PstDC3000.
23027943	XAX1 from glycosyltransferase family 61 mediates xylosyltransfer to rice xylan.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Xylan is the second most abundant polysaccharide on Earth and represents an immense quantity of stored energy for biofuel production. Despite its importance, most of the enzymes that synthesize xylan have yet to be identified. Xylans have a backbone of β-1,4-linked xylose residues with substitutions that include α-(1→2)-linked glucuronosyl, 4-O-methyl glucuronosyl, and α-1,2- and α-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues. The substitutions are structurally diverse and vary by taxonomy, with grass xylan representing a unique composition distinct from dicots and other monocots. To date, no enzyme has yet been identified that is specific to grass xylan synthesis. We identified a xylose-deficient loss-of-function rice mutant in Os02g22380, a putative glycosyltransferase in a grass-specific subfamily of family GT61. We designate the mutant xax1 for xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan 1. Enzymatic fingerprinting of xylan showed the specific absence in the mutant of a peak, which was isolated and determined by (1)H-NMR to be (β-1,4-Xyl)(4) with a β-Xylp-(1→2)-α-Araf-(1→3). Rice xax1 mutant plants are deficient in ferulic and coumaric acid, aromatic compounds known to be attached to arabinosyl residues in xylan substituted with xylosyl residues. The xax1 mutant plants exhibit an increased extractability of xylan and increased saccharification, probably reflecting a lower degree of diferulic cross-links. Activity assays with microsomes isolated from tobacco plants transiently expressing XAX1 demonstrated xylosyltransferase activity onto endogenous acceptors. Our results provide insight into grass xylan synthesis and how substitutions may be modified for increased saccharification for biofuel generation.
23086301	Overexpression of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) TAPETUM DEVELOPMENT1-like Eg707 in rice affects cell division and differentiation and reduces fertility.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	The functional analysis of the TAPETUM DEVELOPMENT1-like analog Eg707 of oil palm was carried out in rice by over-expressing Eg707 under the control of a double cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Ectopic expression of Eg707 in rice induced dark green and matured compact brownish calli compared to pale wild type and negative control calli. Regenerated transgenic rice plants exhibited a reduction in organ size and plant height, rolled, erect leaves, less tillers, increased chlorophyll content, and reduced fertility with smaller green seeds. At the molecular level Eg707 overexpression caused an increase in the transcription of SAPK9, a SnRK2 protein kinase family member that is activated by ABA and hyperosmotic stress. Together, the results show that ectopic Eg707 expression influences cell division and differentiation, presumably via altered hormone homeostasis.
23298446	Combining two semidwarfing genes d60 and sd1 for reduced height in 'Minihikari', a new rice germplasm in the 'Koshihikari' genetic background.	2012	Genet Res (Camb)	Dwarfing in rice has dramatically improved and stabilized rice yields worldwide, often controlled by a single dwarf gene, sd1. A novel semidwarf gene d60 complements the gametic lethal gene gal, such that the F(1) between 'Hokuriku 100' (genotype d60d60GalGal, Gal: mutant non-lethal allele) and 'Koshihikari' (D60D60galgal, D60: tall allele) would show 25% sterility due to deterioration of gametes bearing both gal and d60. The F(2) would segregate as one semidwarf (1 d60d60GalGal) : two tall and 25% sterile (2 D60d60Galgal) : six tall (2 D60d60GalGal : 1 D60D60GalGal : 2 D60D60Galgal : 1 D60D60galgal), skewed from a Mendelian segregation ratio of one semidwarf : three tall for a single recessive gene. To pyramid d60 and sd1, into the Japanese super-variety 'Koshihikari', the F(1) (D60d60Galgal) of 'Koshihikari' × 'Hokuriku 100' was first backcrossed with 'Koshihikari', and the BCF(1) segregated into a ratio of one tall and 25% sterile (D60d60Galgal) : two tall (1 D60D60Galgal : 1 D60D60galgal). Tall, 25% sterile BC(1)F(1) plants (D60d60Galgal) were then selected for pollen sterility and backcrossed with 'Koshihikari' as the recurrent parent. It is unnecessary to grow out and select a semidwarf from the BC(n)F(2) if a pollen parent with ~70% pollen fertility is chosen from the BC(n)F(1) to backcross with the recurrent parent. Semidwarfing genes d60 and sd1 were successfully pyramided into the 'Koshihikari' genome by crossing isogenic lines 'Koshihikari d60' and 'Koshihikari sd1', to produce 'Minihikari', a new parental source of both d60 and sd1. 'Minihikari' displayed super-short stature due to the combination of sd1 and d60, which are genetically and functionally independent.
23094910	OsNAC5 overexpression enlarges root diameter in rice plants leading to enhanced drought tolerance and increased grain yield in the field.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought conditions are among the most serious challenges to crop production worldwide. Here, we report the results of field evaluations of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC5, under the control of either the root-specific (RCc3) or constitutive (GOS2) promoters. Field evaluations over three growing seasons revealed that the grain yield of the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 plants were increased by 9%-23% and 9%-26% under normal conditions, respectively. Under drought conditions, however, RCc3:OsNAC5 plants showed a significantly higher grain yield of 22%-63%, whilst the GOS2:OsNAC5 plants showed a reduced or similar yield to the nontransgenic (NT) controls. Both the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 plants were found to have larger roots due to an enlarged stele and aerenchyma at flowering stage. Cell numbers per cortex layer and stele of developing roots were higher in both transgenic plants than NT controls, contributing to the increase in root diameter. The root diameter was enlarged to a greater extent in the RCc3:OsNAC5, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought tolerance. Microarray experiments identified 25 up-regulated genes by more than three-fold (P < 0.01) in the roots of both transgenic lines. Also identified were 19 and 18 up-regulated genes that are specific to the RCc3:OsNAC5 and GOS2:OsNAC5 roots, respectively. Of the genes specifically up-regulated in the RCc3:OsNAC5 roots, GLP, PDX, MERI5 and O-methyltransferase were implicated in root growth and development. Our present findings demonstrate that the root-specific overexpression of OsNAC5 enlarges roots significantly and thereby enhances drought tolerance and grain yield under field conditions.
23053072	Expression of salt-induced 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from Oryza sativa increases stress tolerance and fermentation capacity in genetically engineered yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Peroxiredoxins (Prxs), also termed thioredoxin peroxidases (TPXs), are a family of thiol-specific antioxidant enzymes that are critically involved in cell defense and protect cells from oxidative damage. In this study, a putative chloroplastic 2-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase (OsTPX) was identified by proteome analysis from leaf tissue samples of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings exposed to 0.1 M NaCl for 3 days. To investigate the relationship between the OsTPX gene and the stress response, OsTPX was cloned into the yeast expression vector p426GPD under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) promoter, and the construct was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. OsTPX expression was confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. OsTPX contained two highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys114 and Cys236) and an active site region (FTFVCPT), and it is structurally very similar to human 2-Cys Prx. Heterologous OsTPX expression increased the ability of the transgenic yeast cells to adapt and recover from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stresses, such as a reduction of cellular hydroperoxide levels in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and menadione, by improving redox homeostasis. OsTPX expression also conferred enhanced tolerance to tert-butylhydroperoxide, heat shock, and high ethanol concentrations. Furthermore, high OsTPX expression improved the fermentation capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a high temperature (40 °C) and at the general cultivation temperature (30 °C). The alcohol yield in OsTPX-expressing transgenic yeast increased by approximately 29 % (0.14 g g(-1)) and 21 % (0.12 g g(-1)) during fermentation at 40 and 30 °C, respectively, compared to the wild-type yeast. Accordingly, OsTPX-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged cell survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation. These results suggest that heterologous OsTPX expression increases acquired tolerance to ROS-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves fermentation capacity due to improved cell survival during fermentation, especially at a high temperature.
23083684	Overexpression of OrbHLH001, a putative helix-loop-helix transcription factor, causes increased expression of AKT1 and maintains ionic balance under salt stress in rice.	2013	J Plant Physiol	The basic helix-loop-helix family of proteins, which function as transcription factors, have been intensively studied in plants and animals. However, the molecular mechanism of these factors contributing to stress tolerance is unknown. Here, we report on the overexpression of OrbHLH001 from Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) conferring salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants. The expression of OrbHLH001 was tissue specific, mainly in phloem tissues throughout the plant. Ion assay with the scanning ion-selective electrode technique showed that NaCl stress has a greater influence on Na(+) efflux and K(+) influx in OrbHLH001-overexpressed plants than the wild type. OrbHLH001 protein can induce the expression of OsAKT1 to regulate the Na(+)/K(+) ratio in OrbHLH001-overexpressed plants by specifically binding to an E-box motif in the promoter region of OsAKT1. The mechanism may have potential use in rice molecular breeding.
23108869	Effects of elevated CO₂ on the nutrient compositions and enzymes activities of Nilaparvata lugens nymphs fed on rice plants.	2012	Sci China Life Sci	Elevated CO(2) may reduce the tolerance of Nilaparvata lugen (N. lugens) to adverse environmental factors through the biological and physiological degeneration of N. lugens. In an artificial climate box, under 375 and 750 μL L(-1) CO(2) levels, the rice stems nutrient content, the nutrient content and enzyme activities of N. lugens nymph fed on rice seedlings exposed to ambient and elevated CO(2) were studied. The results showed that rice stems had significantly higher protein and total amino acid levels under ambient than elevated CO(2) levels. Nymphs had significantly higher protein levels in the ambient CO(2) treatment, while their glucose levels were significantly lower under ambient CO(2) conditions. Significantly higher trypsin activity was observed in nymphs grown in elevated CO(2). Significantly lower activities of the protective enzymes total superoxide dismutase and catalase were observed in the nymphs under ambient CO(2). Meanwhile, the activity of the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase was significantly higher in the ambient CO(2) treatment. Measuring how energy and resources were allocated to enzymes in N. lugens nymphs under elevated CO(2) conditions can provide a more meaningful evaluation of their metabolic tolerances to adverse climatic conditions.
22964359	Mapping QTLs and candidate genes for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice of Madhukar×Swarna RILs.	2012	Gene	Identifying QTLs/genes for iron and zinc in rice grains can help in biofortification programs. 168 F(7) RILs derived from Madhukar×Swarna were used to map QTLs for iron and zinc concentrations in unpolished rice grains. Iron ranged from 0.2 to 224 ppm and zinc ranged from 0.4 to 104ppm. Genome wide mapping using 101 SSRs and 9 gene specific markers showed 5 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 12 significantly linked to iron, zinc or both. In all, 14 QTLs were identified for these two traits. QTLs for iron were co-located with QTLs for zinc on chromosomes 7 and 12. In all, ten candidate genes known for iron and zinc homeostasis underlie 12 of the 14 QTLs. Another 6 candidate genes were close to QTLs on chromosomes 3, 5 and 7. Thus the high priority candidate genes for high Fe and Zn in seeds are OsYSL1 and OsMTP1 for iron, OsARD2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2 for zinc and OsNAS3, OsNRAMP1, Heavy metal ion transport and APRT for both iron and zinc together based on our genetic mapping studies as these genes strictly underlie QTLs. Several elite lines with high Fe, high Zn and both were identified.
23110212	Comparative genome-wide transcriptional analysis of Al-responsive genes reveals novel Al tolerance mechanisms in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Rice (Oryza sativa) is the most aluminum (Al)-tolerant crop among small-grain cereals, but the mechanism underlying its high Al resistance is still not well understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying high Al-tolerance, we performed a comparative genome-wide transcriptional analysis by comparing expression profiling between the Al-tolerance cultivar (Koshihikari) and an Al-sensitive mutant star1 (SENSITIVE TO AL RHIZOTOXICITY 1) in both the root tips and the basal roots. Exposure to 20 µM AlCl(3) for 6 h resulted in up-regulation (higher than 3-fold) of 213 and 2015 genes including 185 common genes in the root tips of wild-type and the mutant, respectively. On the other hand, in the basal root, genes up-regulated by Al were 126 and 2419 including 76 common genes in the wild-type and the mutant, respectively. These results indicate that Al-response genes are not only restricted to the root tips, but also in the basal root region. Analysis with genes up- or down-regulated only in the wild-type reveals that there are other mechanisms for Al-tolerance except for a known transcription factor ART1-regulated one in rice. These mechanisms are related to nitrogen assimilation, secondary metabolite synthesis, cell-wall synthesis and ethylene synthesis. Although the exact roles of these putative tolerance genes remain to be examined, our data provide a platform for further work on Al-tolerance in rice.
23123597	Purple rice extract and its constituents suppress endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced retinal damage in vitro and in vivo.	2013	Life Sci	AIMS: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated as a cause of various neurodegenerative diseases. We evaluated the protective effects of purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) bran extract (PRE) and its constituents, namely cyanidin, peonidin, and a newly isolated compound 2-hydroxy-5-[(3S)-3-hydroxybutyl]phenyl-β-D-glucoside (HHPG), against tunicamycin-induced retinal damage.

MAIN METHODS: In an in vitro experiment, protective effects of PRE, cyanidin and HHPG on cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5), which were damaged by treatment with H(2)O(2) or tunicamycin for 24 h, were evaluated. We also investigated the underlying mechanism by examining expressions of ER stress-related proteins, such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and activation of caspase-3 induced by tunicamycin. In an in vivo experiment, mice retinal damage was induced by intravitreous injection of tunicamycin as revealed by histological analysis using hematoxylin-eosin staining.

KEY FINDINGS: The viability of H(2)O(2) or tunicamycin-treated RGC-5, assessed using the tetrazolium salt (WST-8) assay, was improved by treatment with PRE, cyanidin, and HHPG, respectively. PRE did not affect tunicamycin-induced expressions of BiP or CHOP. However, PRE, cyanidin, and HHPG suppressed tunicamycin-induced caspase-3 activation. Histological analysis using hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that intravitreous injection of PRE significantly suppressed the tunicamycin-induced degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in mice.

SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that PRE, cyanidin, and HHPG suppress tunicamycin-induced retinal ganglion cell death at least partly by inhibiting activation of caspase-3, suggesting that PRE and its main constituents prevent retinal disease caused by ER stress.
23073696	The submergence tolerance gene SUB1A delays leaf senescence under prolonged darkness through hormonal regulation in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Leaf senescence is a natural age-dependent process that is induced prematurely by various environmental stresses. Typical alterations during leaf senescence include breakdown of chlorophyll, a shift to catabolism of energy reserves, and induction of senescence-associated genes, all of which can occur during submergence, drought, and constant darkness. Here, we evaluated the influence of the submergence tolerance regulator, SUBMERGENCE1A (SUB1A), in the acclimation responses during leaf senescence caused by prolonged darkness in rice (Oryza sativa). SUB1A messenger RNA was highly induced by prolonged darkness in a near-isogenic line containing SUB1A. Genotypes with conditional and ectopic overexpression of SUB1A significantly delayed loss of leaf color and enhanced recovery from dark stress. Physiological analysis revealed that SUB1A postpones dark-induced senescence through the maintenance of chlorophyll and carbohydrate reserves in photosynthetic tissue. This delay allowed leaves of SUB1A genotypes to recover photosynthetic activity more quickly upon reexposure to light. SUB1A also restricted the transcript accumulation of representative senescence-associated genes. Jasmonate and salicylic acid are positive regulators of leaf senescence, but ectopic overexpression of SUB1A dampened responsiveness to both hormones in the context of senescence. We found that ethylene accelerated senescence stimulated by darkness and jasmonate, although SUB1A significantly restrained dark-induced ethylene accumulation. Overall, SUB1A genotypes displayed altered responses to prolonged darkness by limiting ethylene production and responsiveness to jasmonate and salicylic acid, thereby dampening the breakdown of chlorophyll, carbohydrates, and the accumulation of senescence-associated messenger RNAs. A delay of leaf senescence conferred by SUB1A can contribute to the enhancement of tolerance to submergence, drought, and oxidative stress.
23112280	A GH3 family member, OsGH3-2, modulates auxin and abscisic acid levels and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	Plant responses to abiotic stresses are coordinated by arrays of growth and developmental processes. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play critical roles in developmental programmes and environmental responses, respectively, through complex signalling and metabolism networks. However, crosstalk between the two phytohormones in the stress responses remains largely unknown. Here, it is reported that a GH3 family gene, OsGH3-2, encoding an enzyme catalysing IAA conjugation to amino acids, is involved in the modulation of ABA level and stress tolerance. Expression of OsGH3-2 was induced by drought but was suppressed by cold. Overexpression of OsGH3-2 in rice caused significant morphological aberrations related to IAA deficiency, such as dwarfism, smaller leaves, and fewer crown roots and root hairs. The overexpressing line showed significantly reduced carotene, ABA, and free IAA levels, greater stomata aperture, and faster water loss, and was hypersensitive to drought stress. However, the overexpressing line showed increased cold tolerance, which was due to the combined effects of reduced free IAA content, alleviated oxidative damage, and decreased membrane penetrability. Furthermore, expression levels of some ABA synthesis- and stress-related genes were significantly changed in the overexpression line. It was conclude that OsGH3-2 modulates both endogenous free IAA and ABA homeostasis and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.
23103994	Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factors have important functions in regulating plant growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we characterized two rice pathogen-responsive NAC transcription factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131. We determined that these proteins localized to the nucleus when expressed ectopically and had transcriptional activation activities. ONAC122 and ONAC131 expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M. grisea-induced expression of both genes was faster and higher in the incompatible interaction compared with the compatible interaction during early stages of infection. ONAC122 and ONAC131 were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene). Silencing ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression using a newly modified Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-based silencing vector resulted in an enhanced susceptibility to M. grisea. Furthermore, expression levels of several other defense- and signaling-related genes (i.e. OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system. Our results suggest that both ONAC122 and ONAC131 have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense- and signaling-related genes.
23076168	Heme oxygenase is involved in H(2)O (2)-induced lateral root formation in apocynin-treated rice.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : Apocynin is a natural organic compound structurally related to vanillin. We demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide and heme oxygenase participated in apocynin-induced lateral root formation in rice. Apocynin, also known as acetovanillone, is a natural organic compound structurally related to vanillin. Information concerning the effect of apocynin on plants is limited. In this study, we examined the effect of apocynin on lateral root (LR) formation in rice. Treatment with apocynin induced LR formation and increased H(2)O(2) production, but had no effect on nitric oxide production. Diphenyleneiodonium chloride, an inhibitor of H(2)O(2) generating NADPH oxidase, was effective in reducing apocynin-induced H(2)O(2) production and LR formation. Apocynin treatment also increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased catalase activity. H(2)O(2) application was able to increase the number of LRs. Moreover, H(2)O(2) production caused by H(2)O(2) and apocynin was localized in the root area corresponding to the LR emergence. Treatment with H(2)O(2) and apocynin also increased heme oxygenase (HO) activity and induced OsHO1 mRNA expression. Lateral root formation and HO activity induced by H(2)O(2) and apocynin were reduced by Zn protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO). Our data suggest that both H(2)O(2) and HO are required for apocynin-induced LR formation in rice.
23059537	Root protein profile changes induced by Al exposure in two rice cultivars differing in Al tolerance.	2013	J Proteomics	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a primary limitation to crop growth in acidic soils. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings exposed to Al show significantly inhibited root growth. To understand the precise mechanisms underlying Al toxicity, a comparative protein profile analysis of roots from two rice cultivars was conducted using 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. A total of 79 Al-regulated proteins were identified, from which 54 and 45 proteins were differentially regulated in Kasalath (Al-sensitive) and Koshihikari (Al-resistant) cultivars, respectively. Gene Ontology and clustering analysis revealed an increase in relative abundance in vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, whereas structural proteins were decreased in both cultivars. Under Al toxicity, proteins involved in the antioxidative system, carbohydrate and nucleotide anabolism were increased in Koshihikari, whereas proteins participating in pathogenesis and carbohydrate catabolism were increased in Kasalath. Furthermore, the abundance of proteins involved in signal transduction, translation and transcription were different between the two cultivars. Our results suggest that destruction of the molecular structure is a major cause of cellular damage, and vacuolar sequestration of Al ions is an important Al resistant mechanism in rice. Both active oxygen scavenging systems and carbohydrate metabolism could play important roles in determining the Al tolerance among rice cultivars.
23298447	Identification of stably expressed QTL for heading date using reciprocal introgression line and recombinant inbred line populations in rice.	2012	Genet Res (Camb)	Two sets of reciprocal introgression lines (ILs) and a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between japonica cultivar Xiushui09 and indica breeding line IR2061-520-6-9 (abbreviated as IR2061) were used to identify QTL for heading date (HD). Phenotyping was conducted in Hainan Island for two winter seasons (2007 and 2009). Nine QTLs were detected in the ILs with Xiushui09 background (XS-ILs), and four of which were repeatedly mapped across 2 years. Five QTLs were identified in the ILs with IR2061 background (IR-ILs), and three of which were commonly detected in 2 years. All commonly detected QTL had the same direction of gene effect. Seven QTL for HD were identified in the RILs in 2009. Only three (25%) QTLs were commonly detected using all the three populations (XS-ILs, IR-ILs and RILs). The number of commonly identified QTLs among populations was related to degree of similarity of their genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the genetic background effect is important for detecting HD QTL. QHd7 and QHd10b stably expressed in different populations and across years thus would be exploited in rice breeding programme. Moreover, lines with both of QHd7 and QHd10b resulted in at least 3 days earlier than lines with only one of them QTL, showing evident pyramiding effect.
23086269	Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of ROS scavenging and signal transduction pathways in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in response to different types of ionizing radiation.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Ionizing radiation directly and indirectly affects gene expression within the plant genome. To access the antioxidant response of rice to different types of ionizing radiation, rice seeds were exposed to gamma-ray, cosmic-ray and ion beam radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation dramatically decreased the shoot length in all plants but not the root length compared with a non-irradiated plant. Electron spin resonance, confirmed that the number of free radicals in cell was greatly increased by different types of ionizing radiation. The measurement of the MDA, chlorophyll, carotenoids contents and activity of antioxidant enzymes revealed that gamma-ray and cosmic-ray, but not ion beam, ionization deceased chlorophyll and carotenoids contents, while all three ionization treatments increased the activities of peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase compared with the non-irradiated plants. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip was used to establish the gene transcript profiles of rice genes regarding ROS scavenging and signal transduction pathways after ionization treatment. Many of the rice genes involved in ROS scavenging and signal transduction pathways showed induction or repression that had increased more than twofold after ionization treatment. In particular, genes associated with electron transport, such as NADPH oxidase-like and alternative oxidase, were often down-regulated by more than twofold in response to the ionization treatments. In our transcriptomic profile analysis, we confirmed that the expression of rice genes associated with ROS scavenging and signal transduction pathways was induced or repressed to different degrees by the different types of ionizing radiations, as in other environmental stresses.
23073651	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family.	2012	Plant Cell	Pi acquisition of crops via arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is becoming increasingly important due to limited high-grade rock Pi reserves and a demand for environmentally sustainable agriculture. Here, we show that 70% of the overall Pi acquired by rice (Oryza sativa) is delivered via the symbiotic route. To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 (PT11) and ORYsa;PHT1;13 (PT13). The PT11 lineage of proteins from mono- and dicotyledons is most closely related to homologs from the ancient moss, indicating an early evolutionary origin. By contrast, PT13 arose in the Poaceae, suggesting that grasses acquired a particular strategy for the acquisition of symbiotic Pi. Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis. For symbiotic Pi uptake, however, only PT11 is necessary and sufficient. Consequently, our results demonstrate that mycorrhizal rice depends on the AM symbiosis to satisfy its Pi demands, which is mediated by a single functional Pi transporter, PT11.
23043988	Secretory type of recombinant thioredoxin h induces ER stress in endosperm cells of transgenic rice.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Thioredoxin h (TRX h) functions as a reducing protein and is present in all organisms. As a new approach for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, TRX h (OsTRX23) was expressed as a secretory protein using the endosperm-specific glutelin GluB-1 promoter and a signal peptide. In transgenic rice seeds, the majority of the recombinant TRX h accumulated in the ER but some was also localized to the protein body IIs (PB-IIs). The rice grain quality was dependent on the TRX h accumulation level. Increased TRX h expression resulted in aberrant phenotypes, such as chalky and shriveled features, lower seed weight and lower seed protein content. Furthermore, the accumulation of some seed storage proteins (SSPs) was significantly suppressed and the morphology of the protein bodies (PB-Is and PB-IIs) changed according to the level of TRX h. SSPs, such as 13kDa prolamin and GluA, were specifically modified via the reducing action of TRX h. These changes led to the activation of the ER stress response, which was accompanied by the expression of several chaperone proteins. Specifically, the ER stress markers BiP4 and BiP5 were significantly up-regulated by an increase in the level of TRX h. These results suggest that changes in the conformation of certain SSPs via the action of recombinant TRX h lead to an induced ER stress response in transgenic rice seeds.
22902706	Characterization of stress and methylglyoxal inducible triose phosphate isomerase (OscTPI) from rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	As compared with plant system, triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), a crucial enzyme of glycolysis, has been well studied in animals. In order to characterize TPI in plants, a full-length cDNA encoding OscTPI was cloned from rice and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant OscTPI was purified to homogeneity and it showed Km value of 0.1281 ± 0.025 µM, and the Vmax value of 138.7 ± 16 µmol min (-1) mg (-1) which is comparable to the kinetic values studied in other plants. The OscTPI was found to be exclusively present in the cytoplasm when checked with the various methods. Functional assay showed that OscTPI could complement a TPI mutation in yeast. Real time PCR analysis revealed that OscTPI transcript level was regulated in response to various abiotic stresses. Interestingly, it was highly induced under different concentration of methylglyoxal (MG) stress in a concentration dependent manner. There was also a corresponding increase in the protein and the enzyme activity of OscTPI both in shoot and root tissues under MG stress. Our result shows that increases in MG leads to the increase in TPI which results in decrease of DHAP and consequently decrease in the level of toxic MG.
23017837	Heteroexpression of the wheat phytochelatin synthase gene (TaPCS1) in rice enhances cadmium sensitivity.	2012	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Phytochelatin synthase (PCS) (EC 2.3.2.15) catalyzes the final step of phytochelatins (PCs) biosynthesis. PCs are a family of cysteine-rich thiol-reactive and heavy metal-binding peptides that play an important role in sequestration and detoxification of heavy metals in plants. Previous studies have indicated that plants that overexpressed PCS displayed contrasting phenotypes, ranging from enhanced cadmium (Cd) tolerance to Cd hypersensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, the wheat phytochelatin synthase gene, TaPCS1, was heteroexpressed in wild-type rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Zhonghua 11) to evaluate the relationship between synthesis of PCs and Cd tolerance in rice. Data showed that the heteroexpression of TaPCS1 in rice enhanced Cd sensitivity and significantly increased Cd accumulation in shoots, but not in roots. Additionally, the PCS line exhibited a much higher content of PCs and non-protein thiols (NPTs) in shoots. Prominent changes in NPT composition led to reduced glutathione pool depletion and higher Cd content in cell organelles in shoots, followed by higher oxidative stress, which might result in Cd sensitivity. Therefore, the heteroexpression of TaPCS1 in rice is capable of increasing Cd accumulation in rice shoots and enhancing Cd sensitivity.
22921008	Mitochondrial mutation impairs cytoplasmic male sterility rice in response to H₂O₂ stress.	2012	Plant Sci	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a phenomenon widely observed in various plant species characterized with disrupted anther development caused by mitochondrial mutation. CMS is becoming a model system for the investigations of nucleus-cytoplasmic interaction. To reveal the possible effects of CMS genes on plant growth in adverse environment, plant development and biochemical characters of mitochondria from Honglian (HL)-CMS line Yuetai A and maintainer Yuetai B treated with H(2)O(2) were analyzed. Results showed that 40-60mM H(2)O(2) significantly inhibits rice seedling development and growth. When treated with H(2)O(2), ATP content and mitochondrial membrane potential in Yuetai A decreased significantly faster than those of Yuetai B. These biochemical changes were accompanied by the severe nuclear DNA fragmentation and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in the leaf cells of Yuetai A. In addition, the antioxidative enzyme activities and mitochondrial electron transfer chain complexes were significantly down-regulated. Disturbance of the biochemical indexes indicate that HL-CMS line is more susceptible to H(2)O(2) stress than the maintainer line, the deleterious effects caused by the CMS-related ORFH79 peptide compromises the adaptability of HL-CMS line to the adverse environment.
23066780	Oral immunotherapy with transgenic rice seed containing destructed Japanese cedar pollen allergens, Cry j 1 and Cry j 2, against Japanese cedar pollinosis.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Transgenic rice accumulating the modified major Japanese cedar pollen allergens, Cryptomeria japonica 1 (Cry j 1) and Cryptomeria japonica 2 (Cry j 2), which were deconstructed by fragmentation and shuffling, respectively, in the edible part of the seed was generated by transformation of a good-tasting rice variety, 'Koshihikari'. These modified cedar pollen antigens were deposited in ER-derived protein bodies (PB-I), which are suitable for delivery to the mucosal immune system in gut-associated lymphoid tissue when orally administered because antigens bioencapsulated in PB-I are resistant against hydrolysis by intestinal enzymes and harsh environments. Mice fed transgenic seeds daily for three weeks and then challenged with crude cedar pollen allergen showed marked suppression of allergen-specific CD4(+) T-cell proliferation, IgE and IgG levels compared with mice fed nontransgenic rice seeds. As clinical symptoms of pollinosis, sneezing frequency and infiltration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils were also significantly reduced in the nasal tissue. These results imply that oral administration of transgenic rice seeds containing the structurally disrupted Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 antigens, serving as universal antigens, is a promising approach for specific immunoprophylaxis against Japanese cedar pollinosis.
23202932	Effects of white rice, brown rice and germinated brown rice on antioxidant status of type 2 diabetic rats.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, and can be increased by diet like white rice (WR). Though brown rice (BR) and germinated brown rice (GBR) have high antioxidant potentials as a result of their bioactive compounds, reports of their effects on oxidative stress-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes are lacking. We hypothesized therefore that if BR and GBR were to improve antioxidant status, they would be better for rice consuming populations instead of the commonly consumed WR that is known to promote oxidative stress. This will then provide further reasons why less consumption of WR should be encouraged. We studied the effects of GBR on antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic rats, induced using a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection, and also evaluated the effects of WR, BR and GBR on catalase and superoxide dismutase genes. As dietary components, BR and GBR improved glycemia and kidney hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and prevented the deterioration of total antioxidant status in type 2 diabetic rats. Similarly, GBR preserved liver enzymes, as well as serum creatinine. There seem to be evidence that upregulation of superoxide dismutase gene may likely be an underlying mechanism for antioxidant effects of BR and GBR. Our results provide insight into the effects of different rice types on antioxidant status in type 2 diabetes. The results also suggest that WR consumption, contrary to BR and GBR, may worsen antioxidant status that may lead to more damage by free radicals. From the data so far, the antioxidant effects of BR and GBR are worth studying further especially on a long term to determine their effects on development of oxidative stress-related problems, which WR consumption predisposes to.
22902685	The rice ASR5 protein: a putative role in the response to aluminum photosynthesis disturbance.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Under acidic soil conditions, aluminum (Al) becomes available to plants, which must cope with its toxicity by mechanisms involving both internal and external detoxification. Rice is the most Al-tolerant among the crop species, with Al detoxification being managed by both mechanisms. Recently, we focused on ASR (Abscisic acid, Stress and Ripening) gene expression analyses and observed increased ASR5 transcript levels in roots and shoots in response to Al. In addition, ASR5 RNAi knock down plants presented an Al-sensitive phenotype. A proteomic approach showed that ASR5 silencing affected several proteins related to photosynthesis in RNAi rice shoots. Furthermore, an ASR5-GFP fusion in rice protoplasts revealed for the first time a chloroplast localization of this protein. Because it is well known that Al induces photosynthetic dysfunction, here we discuss the hypothesis that ASR5 might be sequestered in the chloroplasts as an inactive transcription factor that could be released to the nucleus in response to Al to regulate genes related to photosynthesis.
23054004	Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Sphingolipid metabolites such as long-chain base 1-phosphates (LCBPs) have been shown to play an important role in plants; however, little is known about their function in plant disease resistance and programmed cell death (PCD). In the present study, we cloned and identified two rice long-chain base kinase (LCBK) genes (OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2), which are involved in biosynthesis of LCBPs, and performed functional analysis in transgenic tobacco. Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv. tabacci, the causal agent of wildfire disease, and tobacco mosaic virus. Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants. Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes. These data suggest that rice LCBKs, probably through regulation of endogenous LCBP level, play important roles in disease resistance response and PCD in plants.
23090144	Roles of the Hd5 gene controlling heading date for adaptation to the northern limits of rice cultivation.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	During the diversification of cultivated rice after domestication, rice was grown in diverse geographic regions using genetic variations attributed to the combination of alleles in loci for adaptability to various environmental conditions. To elucidate the key gene for adaptation in rice cultivars to the northern limit of rice cultivation, we conducted genetic analyses of heading date using extremely early-heading cultivars. The Hd5 gene controlling heading date (flowering time) generated variations in heading date among cultivars adapted to Hokkaido, where is the northernmost region of Japan and one of the northern limits of rice cultivation in the world. The association of the Hd5 genotype with heading date and genetical analysis clearly showed that the loss-of-function Hd5 has an important role in exhibiting earlier heading among a local population in Hokkaido. Distinct distribution of the loss-of-function Hd5 revealed that this mutation event of the 19-bp deletion occurred in a local landrace Bouzu and that this mutation may have been selected as an early-heading variety in rice breeding programs in Hokkaido in the early 1900s. The loss-of-function Hd5 was then introduced into the rice variety Fanny from France and contributed to its extremely early heading under the presence of functional Ghd7. These results demonstrated that Hd5 plays roles not only in generating early heading in variations of heading date among a local population in Hokkaido, but also in extremely early heading for adaptation to northern limits of rice cultivation.
22963226	LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon).	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Flowering at suitable time is very important for plants to adapt to complicated environments and produce their seeds successfully for reproduction. In rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) photoperiod regulation is one of the important factors for controlling heading date. Common wild rice, the ancestor of cultivated rice, exhibits a late heading date and a more sensitive photoperiodic response than cultivated rice. Here, through map-based cloning, we identified a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) LHD1 (Late Heading Date 1), an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, which controls the late heading date of wild rice and encodes a putative HAP3/NF-YB/CBF-A subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor. Sequence analysis revealed that several variants in the coding region of LHD1 were correlated with a late heading date, and a further complementary study successfully rescued the phenotype. These results suggest that a functional site for LHD1 could be among those variants present in the coding region. We also found that LHD1 could down-regulate the expression of several floral transition activators such as Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions. This indicates that LHD1 may delay flowering by repressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions.
22947213	Why no feeding frenzy? Mechanisms of nutrient acquisition and utilization during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating pathogen of rice and wheat. It is a hemibiotroph that exhibits symptomless biotrophic growth for the first 4 to 5 days of infection of susceptible cultivars before becoming necrotrophic. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how M. oryzae is able to grow, acquire nutrients, and interact with the plant cell during infection. In particular, we describe direct mechanisms (such as the integration of carbon and nitrogen metabolism by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1) and indirect mechanisms (such as the suppression of host responses) that allow M. oryzae to utilize available host nutrient. We contrast the ability of M. oryzae to voraciously metabolize a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources in vitro with the carefully orchestrated development it displays during the biotrophic phase of in planta growth and ask how the two observations can be reconciled. We also look at how nutrient acquisition and effector biology might be linked in order to facilitate rapid colonization of the plant host.
23043463	microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important food crop in the world, is considered to be a salt-sensitive crop. Excess levels of salt adversely affect all the major metabolic activities, including cell wall damage, cytoplasmic lysis and genomic stability. In order to cope with salt stress, plants have evolved high degrees of developmental plasticity, including adaptation via cascades of molecular networks and changes in gene expression profiles. Posttranscriptional regulation, through the activity of microRNAs, also plays an important role in the plant response to salinity conditions. MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that modulate gene expression and are involved in the most essential physiological processes, including plant development and adaptation to environmental changes.

RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR408 and osa-MIR164e along with their targeted genes, under salinity stress conditions in wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the PDH45 (Pea DNA Helicase) gene. The present miRNAs were predicted to target the OsABP (ATP-Binding Protein), OsDSHCT (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and OsDBH (DEAD-Box Helicase) genes, included in the DEAD-box helicase family. An in silico characterization of the proteins was performed and the miRNAs predicted targets were validated by RLM-5'RACE. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes were up-regulated in response to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments. The present study also highlighted an increased accumulation of the gene transcripts in wild type plants, with the exception of the OsABP mRNA which showed the highest level (15.1-fold change compared to control) in the transgenic plants treated with 200 mM NaCl. Salinity treatments also affected the expression of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408, found to be significantly down-regulated, although the changes in miRNA expression were limited.

CONCLUSIONS: Osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes. Our data showed that that the genes were up-regulated and the miRNAs were down-regulated in relation to salt stress. The negative correlation between the miRNAs and their targets was proven.
23107769	Hypocholesterolemic effect of rice protein is due to regulating hepatic cholesterol metabolism in adult rats.	2013	Gene	Aging is one of major risk factors for developing hypercholesterolemia. To elucidate the cholesterol-lowering mechanism exerted by rice protein (RP), the effects on hepatic cholesterol outputs and cholesterol metabolism related enzymes were investigated in adult rats, which were fed by casein (CAS) and RP without cholesterol in diets. After 2 weeks of feeding, the significant cholesterol-lowering effect was observed in adult rats fed by RP compared to CAS. The hepatic total- and VLDL-cholesterol secretions into circulation were significantly depressed in RP group, whereas biliary outputs of bile acids and cholesterol were effectively stimulated by RP-feeding, causing an increase in fecal sterol excretion compared to CAS. As a result, the apparent cholesterol absorption was significantly inhibited by RP. RP-feeding significantly increased the activity and gene expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, whereas acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 activity and gene expression were significantly decreased by RP as compared with CAS. Neither activity nor gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase of RP did differ from CAS in the liver. The present study demonstrates that rice protein can prevent hypercholesterolemia through modifying hepatic cholesterol metabolism under cholesterol-free dietary condition. The findings suggest that hypocholesterolemic action induced by rice protein is attributed in part to the inhibition of cholesterol absorption during the adult period.
23077584	Colinearity and similar expression pattern of rice DREB1s reveal their functional conservation in the cold-responsive pathway.	2012	PLoS One	The clustered genes C-repeat (CRT) binding factor (CBF)1/dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)1B, CBF2/DREB1C, and CBF3/DREB1A play a central role in cold acclimation and facilitate plant resistance to freezing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is very sensitive to low temperatures; enhancing the cold stress tolerance of rice is a key challenge to increasing its yield. In this study, we demonstrate chilling acclimation, a phenomenon similar to Arabidopsis cold acclimation, in rice. To determine whether rice CBF/DREB1 genes participate in this cold-responsive pathway, all putative homologs of Arabidopsis DREB1 genes were filtered from the complete rice genome through a BLASTP search, followed by phylogenetic, colinearity and expression analysis. We thereby identified 10 rice genes as putative DREB1 homologs: nine of these were located in rice genomic regions with some colinearity to the Arabidopsis CBF1-CBF4 region. Expression profiling revealed that six of these genes (Os01g73770, Os02g45450, Os04g48350, Os06g03670, Os09g35010, and Os09g35030) were similarly expressed in response to chilling acclimation and cold stress and were co-expressed with genes involved in cold signalling, suggesting that these DREB1 homologs may be involved in the cold response in rice. The results presented here serve as a prelude towards understanding the function of rice homologs of DREB1 genes in cold-sensitive crops.
23124348	Glutathione reductase from Oryza sativa increases acquired tolerance to abiotic stresses in a genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.	2012	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Glutathione reductase (GR, E.C. 1.6.4.2) is an important enzyme that reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to a sulfydryl form (GSH) in the presence of an NADPH-dependent system. This is a critical antioxidant mechanism. Owing to the significance of GR, this enzyme has been examined in a number of animals, plants, and microbes. We performed a study to evaluate the molecular properties of GR (OsGR) from rice (Oryza sativa). To determine whether heterologous expression of OsGR can reduce the deleterious effects of unfavorable abiotic conditions, we constructed a transgenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain expressing the GR gene cloned into the yeast expression vector p426GPD. OsGR expression was confirmed by a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (semiquantitative RT-PCR) assay, Western-blotting, and a test for enzyme activity. OsGR expression increased the ability of the yeast cells to adapt and recover from H2O2-induced oxidative stress and various stimuli including heat shock and exposure to menadione, heavy metals (iron, zinc, copper, and cadmium), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethanol, and sulfuric acid. However, augmented OsGR expression did not affect the yeast fermentation capacity owing to reduction of OsGR by multiple factors produced during the fermentation process. These results suggest that ectopic OsGR expression conferred acquired tolerance by improving cellular homeostasis and resistance against different stresses in the genetically modified yeast strain, but did not affect fermentation ability.
23170937	Arg188 in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 is crucial for substrate transport.	2012	BMC Biochem	BACKGROUND: Plant sucrose uptake transporters (SUTs) are H+/sucrose symporters related to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). SUTs are essential for plant growth but little is known about their transport mechanism. Recent work identified several conserved, charged amino acids within transmembrane spans (TMS) in SUTs that are essential for transport activity. Here we further evaluated the role of one of these positions, R188 in the fourth TMS of OsSUT1, a type II SUT.

RESULTS: The OsSUT1(R188K) mutant, studied by expression in plants, yeast, and Xenopus oocytes, did not transport sucrose but showed a H+ leak that was blocked by sucrose. The H+ leak was also blocked by β-phenyl glucoside which is not translocated by OsSUT1. Replacing the corresponding Arg in type I and type III SUTs, AtSUC1(R163K) and LjSUT4(R169K), respectively, also resulted in loss of sucrose transport activity. Fluorination at the glucosyl 3 and 4 positions of α-phenyl glucoside greatly decreased transport by wild type OsSUT1 but did not affect the ability to block H+ leak in the R188K mutant.

CONCLUSION: OsSUT1 R188 appears to be essential for sucrose translocation but not for substrate interaction that blocks H+ leak. Therefore, we propose that an additional binding site functions in the initial recognition of substrates. The corresponding Arg in type I and III SUTs are equally important. We propose that R188 interacts with glucosyl 3-OH and 4-OH during translocation.
23257077	Suppressive subtraction hybridization reveals that rice gall midge attack elicits plant-pathogen-like responses in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	The Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is the third most destructive insect pest of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Till date, 11 gall midge resistance gene loci have been characterized in different rice varieties. To elucidate molecular basis of incompatible (hypersensitive response plus [HR+] type) and compatible rice-gall midge interactions, two suppressive subtraction hybridization cDNA libraries were constructed. These were enriched for differentially expressed transcripts after gall midge infestation in two rice varieties (resistant Suraksha and susceptible TN1). In total, 2784 ESTs were generated and sequenced from the two libraries, of which 1536 were from the resistant Suraksha and 1248 were from the susceptible TN1. Majority (80%) of the ESTs was non-redundant sequences with known functions and was classified into three principal gene ontology (GO) categories and 12 groups. Upregulation of NBS-LRR, Cytochrome P450, heat shock proteins, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and OsPR10α genes from the Suraksha library, as revealed by real-time PCR, indicated that R gene mediated, salicylic acid related defense pathway is likely to be involved in gall midge resistance. Present study suggested that resistance in Suraksha against gall midge is similar in nature to the resistance observed in plants against pathogens. However, in TN1, genes related to primary metabolism and redox were induced abundantly. Results suggested that genes encoding translationally controlled tumor protein and NAC domain proteins are likely to be involved in the gall midge susceptibility.
23020748	Effort and contribution of T-DNA Insertion mutant library for rice functional genomics research in China: review and perspective.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	With the completion of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome-sequencing project, the rice research community proposed to characterize the function of every predicted gene in rice by 2020. One of the most effective and high-throughput strategies for studying gene function is to employ genetic mutations induced by insertion elements such as T-DNA or transposons. Since 1999, with support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China for Rice Functional Genomics Programs, large-scale T-DNA insertion mutant populations have been generated in Huazhong Agricultural University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Currently, a total of 372,346 mutant lines have been generated, and 58,226 T-DNA or Tos17 flanking sequence tags have been isolated. Using these mutant resources, more than 40 genes with potential applications in rice breeding have already been identified. These include genes involved in biotic or abiotic stress responses, nutrient metabolism, pollen development, and plant architecture. The functional analysis of these genes will not only deepen our understanding of the fundamental biological questions in rice, but will also offer valuable gene resources for developing Green Super Rice that is high-yielding with few inputs even under the poor growth conditions of many regions of Africa and Asia.
23204500	Confirming stereochemical structures of strigolactones produced by rice and tobacco.	2013	Mol Plant	Major strigolactones (SLs) produced by rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Michinoku No. 1) were purified and their stereochemical structures were determined by comparing with optically pure synthetic standards for their NMR and CD data and retention times and mass fragmentations in ESI-LC/MS and GC-MS. SLs purified from root exudates of rice plants were orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate, and ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol. In addition to these SLs, 7-oxoorobanchyl acetate and the putative three methoxy-5-deoxystrigol isomers were detected by LC-MS/MS. The production of 7-oxoorobanchyl acetate seemed to occur in the early growth stage, as it was detected only in the root exudates collected during the first week of incubation. The root exudates of tobacco contained at least 11 SLs, including solanacol, solanacyl acetate, orobanchol, ent-2'-epi-orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate, ent-2'-epi-orobanchyl acetate, 5-deoxystrigol, ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol, and three isomers of putative didehydro-orobanchol whose structures remain to be clarified. Furthermore, two sorgolactone isomers but not sorgolactone were detected as minor SLs by LC-MS/MS analysis. It is intriguing to note that rice plants produced only orobanchol-type SLs, derived from ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol, but both orobanchol-type and strigol-type SLs, derived from 5-deoxystrigol were detected in tobacco plants.
23129483	High-level production of lactostatin, a hypocholesterolemic peptide, in transgenic rice using soybean A1aB1b as carrier.	2013	Transgenic Res	Hypercholesterolemia, a form of cardiovascular disease, is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Lactostatin (Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys), derived from β-lactoglobulin in cow's milk, is a bioactive peptide with hypocholesterolemic activity higher than sitosterol, a known anti-hypercholesterolemic drug. Here, we successfully developed a transgenic rice accumulating a much higher level of lactostatin by inserting 29 IIAEK sequences into the structurally flexible (nonconserved) regions of soybean seed storage protein, A1aB1b, and introducing it into LGC-1 (low glutelin content mutant 1) as host variety. A1aB1b containing 29 lactostatins was expressed in the endosperm of rice seed cells by using seed specific promoters and sorted into novel compartments distinct from normal PB-I (ER-derived protein body) and PB-II (protein storage vacuoles). Transgenic rice seeds accumulated approximately 2 mg of lactostatins/g of dry seeds, which is relatively high compared with previous reports. Our findings suggest that the introduction of a high copy number of bioactive peptide into seed storage proteins as carrier is one of the effective means in producing higher amounts of bioactive peptides in rice.
23201414	Cellular localization of mitotic RAD21 with repetitive amino acid motifs in Allium cepa.	2013	Gene	Onion can be used in experimental observation of mitotic cell division in plant science because its chromosome is large and easy to observe. However, molecular genetic studies are difficult in onion because of its large genome size, and only limited information of onion genes has been available to date. Here we cloned and characterized an onion homologue of mitotic RAD21 gene, AcRAD21-1, to develop a molecular marker of mitosis. The N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions of deduced AcRAD21-1 protein sequence were conserved with Arabidopsis SYN4/AtRAD21.3 and rice OsRAD21-1, whereas three characteristic types of repetitive motifs (Repeat-1, Repeat-2/2', and Repeat-3) were observed between the conserved regions. Such inserted repetitive amino acid sequences enlarge the AcRAD21-1 protein into almost 200 kDa, which belongs to the largest class of plant proteins. Genomic organization of the AcRAD21-1 locus was also determined, and the possibility of tandem exon duplication in Repeat-2 was revealed. Subsequently, the polyclonal antiserum was raised against the N-terminal region of AcRAD21-1, and purified by affinity chromatography. Immunohistochemical analysis with the purified antibody successfully showed localization of AcRAD21-1 in onion mitosis, suggesting that it can be used as a molecular marker visualizing dynamic movement of cohesin.
23134977	Expression analysis of calmodulin and calmodulin-like genes from rice, Oryza sativa L.	2012	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: In plants, a large family of calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins transduce the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations by binding to and altering the activities of target proteins, and thereby affecting the physiological responses to a vast array of stimuli. Here, transcript expression analysis of Cam and CML gene family members in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was extensively examined.

RESULTS: Cam and CML genes in rice exhibited differential expression patterns in tissues/organs. Under osmotic stress and salt stress, expression of OsCam1-1, OsCML4, 5, 8, and 11 was induced with different kinetics and magnitude. OsCML4 and 8 mRNA levels significantly increased by 3 h after treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 h while expression of OsCam1-1, OsCML5 and 11 was up-regulated as early as 1-3 h before rapidly returning to normal levels. Several cis-acting elements in response to abiotic stresses, including DREs (important promoter elements responsive to drought, high salt, and cold stress), were detected in the 5' upstream regions of these genes. The observed induction of the GUS activity of transgenic rice plants via the OsCam1-1 promoter appeared to be biphasic and dependent on the severity of salt stress.

CONCLUSIONS: Large OsCam and OsCML gene family members likely play differential roles as signal transducers in regulating various developmental processes and represent important nodes in the signal transduction and transcriptional regulation networks in abiotic stresss responses mediated by the complex Ca2+ signals in plants, which are rich in both spatial and temporal information.
22940453	Expression patterns of defense genes in resistance of the panicles exserted from the caulis and from the tillers to neck blast in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	The rice variety Xiushui227 is resistant to neck blast in the panicles exserted from the caulis but susceptible in the panicles from the tillers, however, the other variety Xiushui09 is susceptible to neck blast in the panicles from the caulis but resistant in the panicles from the tillers. These two varieties were used to analyze the expression patterns of defense genes in the panicles from the caulis and the first first-class tiller at the preliminary heading stage, after inoculating the necks in vitro with Magnaporthe oryzae, respectively. All defense genes (pathogenesis-related genes PR1a, Gns1 (1,3; 1,4-β-glucanase), Cht-1 (chitinase), PR4, PR5, and PR10a, secondary metabolite pathway genes PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), CHS (chalcone synthase), and LOX (lipoxygenase), and oxidative stress-related protein genes POX22.3 (peroxidase), and PPO (polyphenol oxidase)) used in this experiment except Cht-1 and PR5 could participate in defending Xiushui227 against neck blast in the panicles from the caulis. All defense genes used in this study except Cht-1, PR10a, and PPO may play roles in defending Xiushui09 against neck blast in the panicles from the tillers.
23209649	Activation of the jasmonic acid pathway by depletion of the hydroperoxide lyase OsHPL3 reveals crosstalk between the HPL and AOS branches of the oxylipin pathway in rice.	2012	PLoS One	The allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) branches of the oxylipin pathway, which underlie the production of jasmonates and aldehydes, respectively, function in plant responses to a range of stresses. Regulatory crosstalk has been proposed to exist between these two signaling branches; however, there is no direct evidence of this. Here, we identified and characterized a jasmonic acid (JA) overproduction mutant, cea62, by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library for lineages that constitutively express the AOS gene. Map-based cloning was used to identify the underlying gene as hydroperoxide lyase OsHPL3. HPL3 expression and the enzyme activity of its product, (E)-2-hexenal, were depleted in the cea62 mutant, which resulted in the dramatic overproduction of JA, the activation of JA signaling, and the emergence of the lesion mimic phenotype. A time-course analysis of lesion formation and of the induction of defense responsive genes in the cea62 mutant revealed that the activation of JA biosynthesis and signaling in cea62 was regulated in a developmental manner, as was OsHPL3 activity in the wild-type plant. Microarray analysis showed that the JA-governed defense response was greatly activated in cea62 and this plant exhibited enhanced resistance to the T1 strain of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonasoryzaepvoryzae (Xoo). The wounding response was attenuated in cea62 plants during the early stages of development, but partially recovered when JA levels were elevated during the later stages. In contrast, the wounding response was not altered during the different developmental stages of wild-type plants. These findings suggest that these two branches of the oxylipin pathway exhibit crosstalk with regards to biosynthesis and signaling and cooperate with each other to function in diverse stress responses.
23017906	A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA9 affects cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice.	2012	Plant Sci	Rice is a model organism in poaceae plants to study cell wall biosynthesis. In this study, a mutant S1-60 isolated from an EMS mutagenized japonica cultivar Nipponbare, is characterized by brittle culms that can be easily broken by bending. The reduction in mechanical strength was due to defect in thickening of the sclerenchyma cell wall. The amount of cellulose in S1-60 culms was reduced to 44.7% of that of wild-type plants. Besides, the mutant also exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes, such as dwarfism and partial sterility. Genetic analysis and map-based cloning showed that all the phenotype of S1-60 mutant was caused by a recessive point mutation in the OsCESA9 gene, which encodes the cellulose synthase A subunit 9. This yet uncharacterized missense mutation changed the highly conserved G905 to D at the beginning of the fifth transmembrane domain. The OsCESA9 gene is predominantly expressed in the culms of mature stage plants, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm. These results indicate that OsCESA9 plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth.
23192363	Accumulation of rice prolamin-GFP fusion proteins induces ER-derived protein bodies in transgenic rice calli.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : We showed that rice prolamin polypeptides formed ER-derived PBs in transgenic rice calli, and that this heterologous transgene expression system is suitable for studying the mechanism of rice PB-I formation. Rice prolamins, alcohol-soluble seed storage proteins, accumulate directly within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, leading to the formation of ER-derived type I protein bodies (PB-Is) in rice seed. Because rice prolamins do not possess a well-known ER retention signal such as K(H)DEL, or a unique sequence for retention in the ER such as a tandem repeat domain of maize and wheat prolamins, the mechanisms of prolamin accumulation in the ER and PB-I formation are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the formation mechanisms of PBs by expressing four types of rice prolamin species fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in transgenic rice calli. Each prolamin-GFP fusion protein was stably accumulated in rice calli and formed ER-derived PBs. In contrast, GFP fused with the signal peptide of prolamin was secreted into the intercellular space in rice calli. In addition, each of the four types of prolamin-GFP fusion proteins was co-localized with the ER chaperone binding protein. These results suggest that the mature polypeptide of prolamin is capable of being retained in the ER and induce the formation of PBs in non-seed tissue, and that the rice callus heterologous transgene expression system is useful for studying the mechanisms of rice PB-I formation.
23208135	[Major domestication traits in Asian rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an excellent model plant in elucidation of cereal domestication. Loss of seed shattering, weakened dormancy, and changes in plant architecture were thought to be three key events in the rice domestication and creating the high-yield, uniform-germinating, and densely-planting modern rice. Loss of shattering is considered to be the direct morphological evidence for identifying domesticated rice. Two major shattering QTLs, Sh4 and qSH1, have displayed different domestication histories. Weakened seed dormancy is essential for synchronous germination in agricultural production. Genes Sdr4, qSD7-1, and qSD12 impose a global and complementary adaptation strategies in controlling seed dormancy. The prostate growth habit of wild rice is an adaptation to disturbed habitats, while the erect growth habit of rice cultivars meet the needs of compact planting, and such a plant architecture is mainly controlled by PROG1. The outcrossing habit of wild rice promotes propagation of domestication genes among different populations, while the self-pollinating habit of cultivated rice facilitates fixation of domestication genes. Currently, the researches on rice domestication mainly focus on individual genes or multiple neutral markers, and much less attention has been paid to the evolution of network controlling domestication traits. With the progress in functional genomics research, the molecular mechanism of domestication traits is emerging. Rice domestication researches based on network will be more comprehensive and better reflect rice domestica-tion process. Here, we reviewed most progresses in molecular mechanisms of rice domestication traits, in order to provide the new insights for rice domestication and molecular breeding.
23132948	Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain is a major dietary source of cadmium (Cd), which is toxic to humans, but no practical technique exists to substantially reduce Cd contamination. Carbon ion-beam irradiation produced three rice mutants with <0.05 mg Cd⋅kg(-1) in the grain compared with a mean of 1.73 mg Cd⋅kg(-1) in the parent, Koshihikari. We identified the gene responsible for reduced Cd uptake and developed a strategy for marker-assisted selection of low-Cd cultivars. Sequence analysis revealed that these mutants have different mutations of the same gene (OsNRAMP5), which encodes a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein. Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain. In addition, we developed DNA markers to facilitate marker-assisted selection of cultivars carrying osnramp5. When grown in Cd-contaminated paddy fields, the mutants have nearly undetectable Cd in their grains and exhibit no agriculturally or economically adverse traits. Because mutants produced by ion-beam radiation are not transgenic plants, they are likely to be accepted by consumers and thus represent a practical choice for rice production worldwide.
23164055	Improving panicle exsertion of rice cytoplasmic male sterile line by combination of artificial microRNA and artificial target mimic.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	The adoption of hybrid rice caused the second leap in rice yield after the 'green revolution' and contributes substantially to food security of China and the world. However, almost all cytoplasmic male sterile lines (A lines) as females of hybrid rice have a natural deficiency of 'panicle enclosure', which blocks pollination between the A line and the fertility restorer line as the male (R line) of hybrid rice and decreases seed yield. In hybrid rice seed production, exogenous '920' (the active ingredient is gibberellin A3 ) must be applied to eliminate or alleviate panicle enclosure of the A line; however, this not only increases production cost and pollutes the environment, it also decreases seed quality. In this study, we designed a transgenic approach to improve plant height and panicle exsertion of the A line to facilitate hybrid rice production and maintain the semi-dwarf plant type of the hybrid. This approach comprising two components-artificial microRNA (amiRNA) and artificial target mimicry-can manipulate the differential expression of the endogenous Eui1 gene that is associated with rice internode elongation in the A line and the hybrid. amiRNA is a recently developed gene silencing method with high specificity, while target mimicry is a natural mechanism inhibiting the miRNA function that was also recently characterized. This approach provides a paradigm to tune the expression of endogenous genes to achieve the desired phenotype by combining amiRNA and artificial target mimicry technologies.
23117720	Recent emergence of the wheat Lr34 multi-pathogen resistance: insights from haplotype analysis in wheat, rice, sorghum and Aegilops tauschii.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Spontaneous sequence changes and the selection of beneficial mutations are driving forces of gene diversification and key factors of evolution. In highly dynamic co-evolutionary processes such as plant-pathogen interactions, the plant's ability to rapidly adapt to newly emerging pathogens is paramount. The hexaploid wheat gene Lr34, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, confers durable field resistance against four fungal diseases. Despite its extensive use in breeding and agriculture, no increase in virulence towards Lr34 has been described over the last century. The wheat genepool contains two predominant Lr34 alleles of which only one confers disease resistance. The two alleles, located on chromosome 7DS, differ by only two exon-polymorphisms. Putatively functional homoeologs and orthologs of Lr34 are found on the B-genome of wheat and in rice and sorghum, but not in maize, barley and Brachypodium. In this study we present a detailed haplotype analysis of homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in genetically and geographically diverse selections of wheat, rice and sorghum accessions. We found that the resistant Lr34 haplotype is unique to the wheat D-genome and is not found in the B-genome of wheat or in rice and sorghum. Furthermore, we only found the susceptible Lr34 allele in a set of 252 Ae. tauschii genotypes, the progenitor of the wheat D-genome. These data provide compelling evidence that the Lr34 multi-pathogen resistance is the result of recent gene diversification occurring after the formation of hexaploid wheat about 8,000 years ago.
22895058	The potential bioproduction of the pharmaceutical agent sakuranetin, a flavonoid phytoalexin in rice.	None	Bioengineered	Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, can be induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, treatment with CuCl 2 or jasmonic acid (JA), or phytopathogenic infection. In addition to sakuranetin's biological significance on disease resistance in rice, its broad bioactivities have recently been described. Results from these studies have shown that sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin, a precursor of sakuranetin, by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT), but the relevant gene has not yet been identified in rice. Recently, we identified the OsNOMT gene, which is involved in the final step of sakuranetin biosynthesis in rice. In previous studies, OsNOMT was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves; however, the purified protein, termed OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity, but not NOMT activity. Based on the analysis of an oscomt1 T-DNA tagged mutant, we determined that OsCOMT1 did not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo. Therefore, we took advantage of the oscomt1 mutant to purify OsNOMT. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation with a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa in the purest enzyme preparation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight analysis showed that the 40 kDa protein band included two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, but one of the proteins encoded by Os12g0240900 exhibited clear NOMT activity; thus, this gene was designated OsNOMT. Gene expression was induced by treatment with jasmonic acid in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the recombinant protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to NOMT. Identification of the OsNOMT gene enables the production of large amounts of sakuranetin through transgenic rice and microorganisms. This finding also allows for the generation of disease-resistant and sakuranetin biofortified rice in the future.
23185238	Transcriptome and gene expression analysis of the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrosis medinalis.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The rice leaf folder (RLF), Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most destructive pests affecting rice in Asia. Although several studies have been performed on the ecological and physiological aspects of this species, the molecular mechanisms underlying its developmental regulation, behavior, and insecticide resistance remain largely unknown. Presently, there is a lack of genomic information for RLF; therefore, studies aimed at profiling the RLF transcriptome expression would provide a better understanding of its biological function at the molecular level.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: De novo assembly of the RLF transcriptome was performed via the short read sequencing technology (Illumina). In a single run, we produced more than 23 million sequencing reads that were assembled into 44,941 unigenes (mean size = 474 bp) by Trinity. Through a similarity search, 25,281 (56.82%) unigenes matched known proteins in the NCBI Nr protein database. The transcriptome sequences were annotated with gene ontology (GO), cluster of orthologous groups of proteins (COG), and KEGG orthology (KO). Additionally, we profiled gene expression during RLF development using a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. Five DGE libraries were constructed, and variations in gene expression were compared between collected samples: eggs vs. 3(rd) instar larvae, 3(rd) instar larvae vs. pupae, pupae vs. adults. The results demonstrated that thousands of genes were significantly differentially expressed during various developmental stages. A number of the differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).

CONCLUSIONS: The RLF transcriptome and DGE data provide a comprehensive and global gene expression profile that would further promote our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying various biological characteristics, including development, elevated fecundity, flight, sex differentiation, olfactory behavior, and insecticide resistance in RLF. Therefore, these findings could help elucidate the intrinsic factors involved in the RLF-mediated destruction of rice and offer sustainable insect pest management.
23125910	Molecular breeding for the development of multiple disease resistance in Basmati rice.	2012	AoB Plants	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Basmati rice grown in the Indian subcontinent is highly valued for its unique culinary qualities. Production is, however, often constrained by diseases such as bacterial blight (BB), blast and sheath blight (ShB). The present study developed Basmati rice with inbuilt resistance to BB, blast and ShB using molecular marker-assisted selection.

METHODOLOGY: The rice cultivar 'Improved Pusa Basmati 1' (carrying the BB resistance genes xa13 and Xa21) was used as the recurrent parent and cultivar 'Tetep' (carrying the blast resistance gene Pi54 and ShB resistance quality trait loci (QTL), qSBR11-1) was the donor. Marker-assisted foreground selection was employed to identify plants possessing resistance alleles in the segregating generations along with stringent phenotypic selection for faster recovery of the recurrent parent genome (RPG) and phenome (RPP). Background analysis with molecular markers was used to estimate the recovery of RPG in improved lines.

PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Foreground selection coupled with stringent phenotypic selection identified plants homozygous for xa13, Xa21 and Pi54, which were advanced to BC(2)F(5) through pedigree selection. Marker-assisted selection for qSBR11-1 in BC(2)F(5) using flanking markers identified seven homozygous families. Background analysis revealed that RPG recovery was up to 89.5%. Screening with highly virulent isolates of BB, blast and ShB showed that the improved lines were resistant to all three diseases and were on a par with 'Improved Pusa Basmati 1' for yield, duration and Basmati grain quality.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of marker-assisted transfer of genes conferring resistance to three different diseases in rice wherein genes xa13 and Xa21 for BB resistance, Pi54 for blast resistance, and a major QTL qSBR11-1 have been combined through marker-assisted backcross breeding. In addition to offering the potential for release as cultivars, the pyramided lines will serve as useful donors of gene(s) for BB, blast and ShB in future Basmati rice breeding programmes.
23202047	Is ABA involved in tolerance responses to salinity by affecting cytoplasm ion homeostasis in rice cell lines?	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	The ability of plant cells to maintain cytoplasm ion homeostasis under saline stress is among the main mechanisms involved in salt tolerance. To cope with excess Na(+), cells extrude it from the cytoplasm, which requires expenditure of metabolic energy, provided by H(+) gradients generated by membrane-bound H(+)-pumps. ABA is well-known to be involved in physiological processes elicited or enhanced by stresses causing cell dehydration. In this work we studied the possible implication of this plant hormone in the control of salt-induced cellular mechanisms conducting to Na(+) extrusion from the cytoplasm. We used rice (Oryza sativa L.) cell lines selected for their different tolerance to salinity to measure the response to ABA of H(+)-pumps and Na(+)/H(+)-antiporters associated to the plasma membrane and the tonoplast. Our results show that ABA generally enhances H(+)-pumping under salt stress but not under control conditions. This effect occurs to a higher extent across the tonoplast in the more tolerant lines (L-T). Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity is practically undetectable in calli under control conditions, pre-treated or not with ABA, but shows a strong activation under salinity across the tonoplast, particularly in L-T lines (cv Bahia) and also across de plasma membrane in cv Bomba. In these lines, prior treatments with ABA tend to reduce the NaCl enhanced activity of both antiporters. Overall, under saline conditions ABA seems to affect synergistically H(+) pumping and antagonistically Na(+) extrusion. A complex network of positive and negative regulatory signals seems involved in restoring ion cell homeostasis under salt stress.
23204406	The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	Although the functions of a few effector proteins produced by bacterial and oomycete plant pathogens have been elucidated in recent years, information for the vast majority of pathogen effectors is still lacking, particularly for those of plant-pathogenic fungi. Here, we show that the avirulence effector AvrPiz-t from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae preferentially accumulates in the specialized structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex and is then translocated into rice (Oryza sativa) cells. Ectopic expression of AvrPiz-t in transgenic rice suppresses the flg22- and chitin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances susceptibility to M. oryzae, indicating that AvrPiz-t functions to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. Interaction assays show that AvrPiz-t suppresses the ubiquitin ligase activity of the rice RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 and that, in return, APIP6 ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t in vitro. Interestingly, agroinfection assays reveal that AvrPiz-t and AvrPiz-t Interacting Protein 6 (APIP6) are both degraded when coexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Silencing of APIP6 in transgenic rice leads to a significant reduction of flg22-induced ROS generation, suppression of defense-related gene expression, and enhanced susceptibility of rice plants to M. oryzae. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism in which a fungal effector targets the host ubiquitin proteasome system for the suppression of PAMP-triggered immunity in plants.
23121287	Construction of gene regulatory networks mediated by vegetative and reproductive stage-specific small RNAs in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	New Phytol	Although huge amounts of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data are available, limited systematic analyses have been performed by integrating these valuable resources. Based on small RNA (sRNA), RNA and degradome HTS data, the sRNAs specifically expressed at vegetative and reproductive stages were identified separately in rice. Two distinct groups of sRNA HTS data, which were prepared during the vegetative and the reproductive stages, were utilized to extract stage-specific sRNAs. Degradome sequencing data were employed for sRNA target validation. RNA sequencing data were used to construct expression-based, sRNA-mediated networks. As a result, 26 microRNAs and 413 sRNAs were specifically expressed at the vegetative stage, and 79 microRNAs and 539 sRNAs were specifically expressed at the reproductive stage. In addition to the microRNAs, numerous stage-specific sRNAs enriched in ARGONAUTE1 showed great potential to perform cleavage-based repression on the targets. Several stage-specific sRNAs were indicated to result from the wobble effect of Dicer-like 1-mediated processing of microRNA precursors. The expression patterns of the sRNA targets, and the stage-specific cleavage signals strongly indicated the reliability of the constructed networks. A set of rice stage-specific sRNAs along with the regulatory cascades, which have great potential in regulating specific developmental stages, were provided for further investigation.
23161853	Overexpression of OsRecQl4 and/or OsExo1 enhances DSB-induced homologous recombination in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	During homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in eukaryotes, an initial step is the creation of a 3'-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang via resection of a 5' end. Rad51 polymerizes on this ssDNA to search for a homologous sequence, and the gapped sequence is then repaired using an undamaged homologous DNA strand as template. Recent studies in eukaryotes indicate that resection of the DSB site is promoted by the cooperative action of RecQ helicase family proteins: Bloom helicase (BLM) in mammals or Sgs1 in yeast, and exonuclease 1 (Exo1). However, the role of RecQ helicase and exonuclease during the 5'-resection process of HR in plant cells has not yet been defined. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of rice proteins OsRecQl4 (BLM counterpart) and/or OsExo1 (Exo1 homolog) can enhance DSB processing, as evaluated by recombination substrate reporter lines in rice. These results could be applied to construct an efficient gene targeting system in rice.
23124325	Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Tiller angle and leaf angle are two important components of rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture that play a crucial role in determining grain yield. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint. LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism. Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint. However, LPA1 only influences gravity perception or signal transduction in coleoptile gravitropism by regulating the sedimentation rate of amyloplasts, distinct from the actions of LAZY1. LPA1 encodes a plant-specific INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein and defines a novel subfamily of 28 INDETERMINATE DOMAIN proteins with several unique conserved features. LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif. Further analysis suggests that LPA1 participates in a complicated transcriptional and protein interaction network and has evolved novel functions distinct from SGR5. This study not only facilitates the understanding of gravitropism mechanisms but also generates a useful genetic material for rice breeding.
23220084	Identification of a phosphorylation site in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase of rice.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase monomerises ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced CPDs present in DNA, using energy from UVA and visible light. In plants, CPD photolyase activity is a crucial factor for determining UVB sensitivity. We previously demonstrated that native rice CPD photolyase is phosphorylated. To determine the phosphorylation site(s), the phosphorylation status of CPD photolyase was analyzed in rice varieties that have amino acid alterations at the potential phosphorylation sites. In wild-rice species, CPD photolyase was phosphorylated. In Poaceae species, CPD photolyase was phosphorylated in wheat but not in maize. Mutant CPD photolyase proteins, in which these putative phosphorylated residues were replaced with alanine residues, were synthesized using an insect cell-free translation system. A slow-migrating band disappeared when the serine residue at position 7 was mutated. A phospho-specific antibody was generated to determine whether this residue is phosphorylated in CPD photolyase. Only the slow-migrating band of native rice CPD photolyase was detected using this antibody, indicating that the serine residue at position 7 is a phosphorylation site in native rice CPD photolyase.
23261650	Two anti-microtubular drugs for two differential responses: a rice cell line resistant to EPC remains susceptible to oryzalin.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Sensitivity to the two anti-microtubular drugs oryzalin and EPC (ethyl-N-phenylcarbamate) is shown to be uncoupled in the rice EPC-resistant ER31d cell line, derived from the corresponding ER31 mutant. The ER31d cell line grows in the presence of EPC but it remains susceptible to oryzalin. In the presence of concentrations of EPC up to 0.4 mM, ER31d cells remain viable maintaining cell anisotropy and detectable cortical microtubule array. The amount of α- and β-tubulin is also maintained high through a regulatory mechanism that operates at post-transcriptional level. In contrast, all these cellular and molecular parameters are heavily affected by the addition of 1 μM oryzalin. Also, the pattern of post-translationally modified α-tubulins changes in the ER31d cells compared to that of their Nihon-Masari wild type line of reference. The different response elicited by the two herbicides is discussed in relation to a possible differential sensitivity of the cortical MT array, that may in turn relate to their different tubulin-binding specificities and chemical structure.
23166615	Genome-wide survey and expression analysis of amino acid transporter gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Amino acid transporters (AATs) that transport amino acids across cellular membranes are essential for plant growth and development. To date, a genome-wide overview of the AAT gene family in rice is not yet available.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a total of 85 AAT genes were identified in rice genome and were classified into eleven distinct subfamilies based upon their sequence composition and phylogenetic relationship. A large number of OsAAT genes were expanded via gene duplication, 23 and 24 OsAAT genes were tandemly and segmentally duplicated, respectively. Comprehensive analyses were performed to investigate the expression profiles of OsAAT genes in various stages of vegetative and reproductive development by using data from EST, Microarrays, MPSS and Real-time PCR. Many OsAAT genes exhibited abundant and tissue-specific expression patterns. Moreover, 21 OsAAT genes were found to be differentially expressed under the treatments of abiotic stresses. Comparative analysis indicates that 26 AAT genes with close evolutionary relationships between rice and Arabidopsis exhibited similar expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study will facilitate further studies on OsAAT family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsAATs.
23010327	Biochemical and structural characterization of recombinant human serum transferrin from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	J Inorg Biochem	The Fe(3+) binding protein human serum transferrin (hTF) is well known for its role in cellular iron delivery via the transferrin receptor (TFR). A new application is the use of hTF as a therapy and targeted drug delivery system for a number of diseases. Recently, production of hTF in plants has been reported; such systems provide a relatively inexpensive, animal-free (eliminating potential contamination by animal pathogens) method to produce large amounts of recombinant proteins for such biopharmaceutical applications. Specifically, the production of Optiferrin (hTF produced in rice, Oryza sativa, from InVitria) has been shown to yield large amounts of functional protein for use in culture medium for cellular iron delivery to promote growth. In the present work we describe further purification (by gel filtration) and characterization of hTF produced in rice (purified Optiferrin) to determine its suitability in biopharmaceutical applications. The spectral, mass spectrometric, urea gel and kinetic analysis shows that purified Optiferrin is similar to recombinant nonglycosylated N-His tagged hTF expressed by baby hamster kidney cells and/or serum derived glycosylated hTF. Additionally, in a competitive immunoassay, iron-loaded Optiferrin is equivalent to iron-loaded N-His hTF in its ability to bind to the soluble portion of the TFR immobilized in an assay plate. As an essential requirement for any functional hTF, both lobes of purified Optiferrin bind Fe(3+) tightly yet reversibly. Although previously shown to be capable of delivering Fe(3+) to cells, the kinetics of iron release from iron-loaded Optiferrin™/sTFR and iron-loaded N-His hTF/sTFR complexes differ somewhat. We conclude that the purified Optiferrin might be suitable for consideration in biopharmaceutical applications.
23265324	Kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate rice growth and development.	2013	Plant Sci	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that participate in multiple biological processes. In this paper, we characterized a classic rice mutant Fn189 (dwarf54, d54) showing semi-dwarf stature and erect leaves. The coleoptile elongation and root growth was less affected in Fn189 than wild-type plant by the exogenous application of eBL, the most active form of BRs. Lamina joint inclination assay and morphological analysis in darkness further showed that Fn189 mutant plant was insensitive to exogenous eBL. Through map-based cloning, Fn189 was found to be a novel allelic mutant of the DWARF 61 (D61) gene, which encodes the putative BRs receptor OsBRI1. A single base mutation caused the I834F substitution in the OsBRI1 kinase domain. Consequently, kinase activity of OsBRI1 was found to decrease dramatically. Taken together, the kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate normal plant growth and development in rice.
23184051	Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes. This review focuses on the conventional breeding to the latest molecular progress in blast disease resistance in rice. This update information will be helpful guidance for rice breeders to develop durable blast resistant rice variety through marker assisted selection.
23013333	Hydrogen peroxide-mediated growth of the root system occurs via auxin signaling modification and variations in the expression of cell-cycle genes in rice seedlings exposed to cadmium stress.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	The link between root growth, H₂O₂, auxin signaling, and the cell cycle in cadmium (Cd)-stressed rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhonghua No. 11) was analyzed in this study. Exposure to Cd induced a significant accumulation of Cd, but caused a decrease in zinc (Zn) content which resulted from the decreased expression of OsHMA9 and OsZIP. Analysis using a Cd-specific probe showed that Cd was mainly localized in the meristematic zone and vascular tissues. Formation and elongation of the root system were significantly promoted by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), but were markedly inhibited by N,N'-dimethylthiourea (DMTU) under Cd stress. The effect of H₂O₂ on Cd-stressed root growth was further confirmed by examining a gain-of-function rice mutant (carrying catalase1 and glutathione-S-transferase) in the presence or absence of diphenylene iodonium. DR5-GUS staining revealed close associations between H₂O₂ and the concentration and distribution of auxin. H₂O₂ affected the expression of key genes, including OsYUCCA, OsPIN, OsARF, and OsIAA, in the auxin signaling pathway in Cd-treated plants. These results suggest that H₂O₂ functions upstream of the auxin signaling pathway. Furthermore, H₂O₂ modified the expression of cell-cycle genes in Cd-treated roots. The effects of H₂O₂ on root system growth are therefore linked to auxin signal modification and to variations in the expression of cell-cycle genes in Cd-stressed rice. A working model for the effects of H₂O₂ on Cd-stressed root system growth is thus proposed and discussed in this paper.
23132589	Overexpression of a rice TIFY gene increases grain size through enhanced accumulation of carbohydrates in the stem.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Screening of rice full-length cDNA overexpressing (FOX) lines allowed the identification of a TIFY gene, TIFY11b, as a growth-promoting gene whose overexpression increased plant height and seed size. The grains of TIFY11b-overexpressing plants exceeded those of non-transformants in length, width and thickness, resulting in 9-21% increases in grain weight. The increase was achieved by overexpressing the gene in the whole plant body, but not by seed-restricted expression, indicating that seed enlargement is attributable to overexpression in vegetative organs such as the leaf. The whole-body overexpressing plants developed longer leaves along with higher levels of starch and sucrose in the leaf sheath and culm at the heading stage than the non-transformants. Although overexpression of TIFY11b did not alter the photosynthetic rate per leaf area before and after heading, it caused an accumulation of higher levels of the carbohydrate assimilate, probably due to increased photosynthesis per plant, suggesting that the increase in grain size and weight is attained by enhanced accumulation and translocation of the carbohydrate in the culms and leaf sheaths of the transgenic plants. Thus, TIFY11b is a novel grain-size increasing gene.
23262183	Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	OsPIP1;1 is one of the most abundant aquaporins in rice leaves and roots and is highly responsible to environmental stresses. However, its biochemical and physiological functions are still largely unknown. The oocyte assay data showed OsPIP1;1 had lower water channel activity in contrast to OsPIP2;1. EGFP and immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed OsPIP1;1 was predominantly localized in not only plasma membrane but also in some ER-like intracellular compartments in the cells. OsPIP1;1 exhibited low water channel activity in Xenopus oocytes but coexpression of OsPIP2;1 significantly enhanced its water permeability. Stop-flow assay indicated that 10His-OsPIP1;1-reconstituted proteoliposomes had significantly higher water permeability than the control liposomes. Overexpression of OsPIP1;1 greatly altered many physiological features of transgenic plants in a dosage-dependent manner. Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate. This work suggests OsPIP1;1 functions as an active water channel and plays important physiological roles.
23116435	New allelic variants found in key rice salt-tolerance genes: an association study.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Salt stress is a complex physiological trait affecting plants by limiting growth and productivity. Rice, one of the most important food crops, is rated as salt-sensitive. High-throughput screening methods are required to exploit novel sources of genetic variation in rice and further improve salinity tolerance in breeding programmes. To search for genotypic differences related to salt stress, we genotyped 392 rice accessions by EcoTILLING. We targeted five key salt-related genes involved in mechanisms such as Na(+) /K(+) ratio equilibrium, signalling cascade and stress protection, and we found 40 new allelic variants in coding sequences. By performing association analyses using both general and mixed linear models, we identified 11 significant SNPs related to salinity. We further evaluated the putative consequences of these SNPs at the protein level using bioinformatic tools. Amongst the five nonsynonymous SNPs significantly associated with salt-stress traits, we found a T67K mutation that may cause the destabilization of one transmembrane domain in OsHKT1;5, and a P140A alteration that significantly increases the probability of OsHKT1;5 phosphorylation. The K24E mutation can putatively affect SalT interaction with other proteins thus impacting its function. Our results have uncovered allelic variants affecting salinity tolerance that may be important in breeding.
23126685	An efficient rice mutagenesis system based on suspension-cultured cells.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	Plant mutants are important bio-resources for crop breeding and gene functional studies. Conventional methods for generating mutant libraries by mutagenesis of seeds with physical or chemical agents are of low efficiency. Here, we developed a highly-efficient ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis system based on suspension-cultured cells, with rice (Oryza sativa L.) as an example. We show that treatment of suspension-cultured tiny cell clusters with 0.4% EMS for 18-22 h followed by differentiation and regeneration produced as high as 29.4% independent mutant lines with visible phenotypic variations, including a number of important agronomic traits such as grain size, panicle size, grain or panicle shape, tiller number and angle, heading date, male sterility, and disease sensitivity. No mosaic mutant was observed in the mutant lines tested. In this mutant library, we obtained a mutant with an abnormally elongated uppermost internode. Sequencing and functional analysis revealed that this is a new allelic mutant of eui (elongated uppermost internode) caused by two point mutations in the first exon of the EUI gene, representing a successful example of this mutagenesis system.
23203072	Endpoint visual detection of three genetically modified rice events by loop-mediated isothermal amplification.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	Genetically modified (GM) rice KMD1, TT51-1, and KF6 are three of the most well known transgenic Bt rice lines in China. A rapid and sensitive molecular assay for risk assessment of GM rice is needed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), currently the most common method for detecting genetically modified organisms, requires temperature cycling and relatively complex procedures. Here we developed a visual and rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify three GM rice event-specific junction sequences. Target DNA was amplified and visualized by two indicators (SYBR green or hydroxy naphthol blue [HNB]) within 60 min at an isothermal temperature of 63 °C. Different kinds of plants were selected to ensure the specificity of detection and the results of the non-target samples were negative, indicating that the primer sets for the three GM rice varieties had good levels of specificity. The sensitivity of LAMP, with detection limits at low concentration levels (0.01%−0.005% GM), was 10- to 100-fold greater than that of conventional PCR. Additionally, the LAMP assay coupled with an indicator (SYBR green or HNB) facilitated analysis. These findings revealed that the rapid detection method was suitable as a simple field-based test to determine the status of GM crops.
23161858	PGR5-dependent cyclic electron transport around PSI contributes to the redox homeostasis in chloroplasts rather than CO(2) fixation and biomass production in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The PGR5 (PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5) gene that is required for PSI cyclic electron transport in Arabidopsis was knocked down in rice (Oryza sativa). In three PGR5 knockdown (KD) lines, the PGR5 protein level was reduced to 5-8% of that in the wild type, resulting in a 50% reduction in PGRL1 (PGR5-LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE 1) protein levels. In ruptured chloroplasts, ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reduction activity was partially impaired; the phenotype was mimicked by addition of antimycin A to wild-type chloroplasts. As occurred in the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant, non-photochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence (NPQ) induction was impaired in the leaves, but the electron transport rate (ETR) was only mildly affected at high light intensity. The P700(+) level was reduced even at low light intensity, suggesting that the PGR5 function was severely disturbed as in the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant and that the other alternative routes of electrons could not compensate the stromal redox balance. The amplitude of the light-dark electrochromic shift (ECS) signal (ECSt), which reflects the total size of the proton motive force in steady-state photosynthesis, was reduced by 13-25% at approximately the growth light intensity. The CO(2) fixation rate was only slightly reduced in the PGR5 KD lines. Despite the drastic reduction in NPQ and P700(+) levels, total biomass was only slightly reduced in PGR5 KD lines grown at 370 µmol photons m(-2) s(-1). These results suggest that CO(2) fixation and growth rate are very robust in the face of alterations in the fundamental reactions of photosynthesis under constant light conditions in rice.
23150632	Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	DNA methylation and histone H3 Lys 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) are important epigenetic repression marks for silencing transposons in heterochromatin and for regulating gene expression. However, the mechanistic relationship to other repressive marks, such as histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is unclear. FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM1 (FIE1) encodes an Esc-like core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which is involved in H3K27me3-mediated gene repression. Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion. We found that Epi-df has no changes in nucleotide sequence but is hypomethylated in the 5' region of FIE1 and has reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me3. In Epi-df, FIE1 was ectopically expressed and its imprinting was disrupted. FIE1 interacted with rice Enhancer of Zeste homologs, consistent with its role in H3K27me3 repression. Ectopic expression of FIE1 in Epi-df resulted in alteration of H3K27me3 levels in hundreds of genes. In summary, this work identifies an epi-allele involved in H3K27me3-mediated gene repression that itself is highly regulated by DNA methylation and histone H3K9me2, thereby shedding light on the link between DNA methylation and histone methylation, the two important epigenetic marks regulating rice development.
23147796	The novel quantitative trait locus GL3.1 controls rice grain size and yield by regulating Cyclin-T1;3.	2012	Cell Res	Increased crop yields are required to support rapid population growth worldwide. Grain weight is a key component of rice yield, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that control it remain elusive. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a new quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the control of rice grain length, weight and yield. This locus, GL3.1, encodes a protein phosphatase kelch (PPKL) family - Ser/Thr phosphatase. GL3.1 is a member of the large grain WY3 variety, which is associated with weaker dephosphorylation activity than the small grain FAZ1 variety. GL3.1-WY3 influences protein phosphorylation in the spikelet to accelerate cell division, thereby resulting in longer grains and higher yields. Further studies have shown that GL3.1 directly dephosphorylates its substrate, Cyclin-T1;3, which has only been rarely studied in plants. The downregulation of Cyclin-T1;3 in rice resulted in a shorter grain, which indicates a novel function for Cyclin-T in cell cycle regulation. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of grain size and yield that is driven through a novel phosphatase-mediated process that affects the phosphorylation of Cyclin-T1;3 during cell cycle progression, and thus provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying crop seed development. We bred a new variety containing the natural GL3.1 allele that demonstrated increased grain yield, which indicates that GL3.1 is a powerful tool for breeding high-yield crops.
22527842	Effect of silicon deficiency on secondary cell wall synthesis in rice leaf.	2012	J Plant Res	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a typical Si-accumulating plant and is able to accumulate Si up to >10 % of shoot dry weight. The cell wall has been reported to become thicker under Si-deficient condition. To clarify the relationship between Si accumulation and cell wall components, the physical properties of, and macromolecular components and Si content in, the pectic, hemicellulosic, and cellulosic fractions prepared from rice seedlings grown in hydroponics with or without 1.5 mM silicic acid were analyzed. In the absence of Si (the -Si condition), leaf blades drooped, but physical properties were enhanced. Sugar content in the cellulosic fraction and lignin content in the total cell wall increased under -Si condition. After histochemical staining, there was an increase in cellulose deposition in short cells and the cell layer just beneath the epidermis in the -Si condition, but no significant change in the pattern of lignin deposition. Expression of the genes involved in secondary cell wall synthesis, OsCesA4, OsCesA7, OsPAL, OsCCR1 and OsCAD6 was up-regulated under -Si condition, but expression of OsCesA1, involved in primary cell wall synthesis, did not increase. These results suggest that an increase in secondary cell wall components occurs in rice leaves to compensate for Si deficiency.
23248202	Whole genomic sequencing of RT98 mitochondria derived from Oryza rufipogon and northern blot analysis to uncover a cytoplasmic male sterility-associated gene.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait resulting in the failure to produce functional pollen and is often observed when an alien cytoplasm is transferred into a cultivated species. An RT98A CMS line and an RT98C fertility restorer line were obtained by successive backcrossing between Oryza rufipogon W1109 and Oryza sativa cultivar Taichung 65. To uncover the CMS-associated mitochondrial genes, we determined the complete sequence of the RT98-CMS mitochondrial genome using next-generation pyrosequencing, and searched new open reading frames (orfs) absent in a reported mitochondrial genome of O. sativa Nipponbare. Then, six candidates were selected for the CMS-associated genes based on the criteria in which they were chimeric in structure or encoded a peptide with transmembrane domains. One of the candidates, orf113, showed different transcript sizes between RT98A and RT98C on Northern blot analysis. The orf113 gene was shown to be co-transcribed with atp4 and cox3 encoding ATP synthase F0 subunit 4 and Cyt c oxidase subunit 3, respectively, and their transcripts were distinctly processed in the presence of a fertility restorer gene. Our results indicate that orf113 is a CMS-associated gene of RT98-CMS.
23228240	Identification of transcription factors potential related to brown planthopper resistance in rice via microarray expression profiling.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice. The molecular responses of plants to sucking insects resemble responses to pathogen infection. However, the molecular mechanism of BPH-resistance in rice remains unclear. Transcription factors (TF) are up-stream regulators of various genes that bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the transcription from DNA to mRNA. They are key regulators for transcriptional expression in biological processes, and are probably involved in the BPH-induced pathways in resistant rice varieties.

RESULTS: We conducted a microarray experiment to analyze TF genes related to BPH resistance in a Sri Lankan rice cultivar, Rathu Heenati (RHT). We compared the expression profiles of TF genes in RHT with those of the susceptible rice cultivar Taichun Native 1 (TN1). We detected 2038 TF genes showing differential expression signals between the two rice varieties. Of these, 442 TF genes were probably related to BPH-induced resistance in RHT and TN1, and 229 may be related to constitutive resistance only in RHT. These genes showed a fold change (FC) of more than 2.0 (P<0.05). Among the 442 TF genes related to BPH-induced resistance, most of them were readily induced in TN1 than in RHT by BPH feeding, for instance, 154 TF genes were up-regulated in TN1, but only 31 TF genes were up-regulated in RHT at 24 hours after BPH infestation; 2-4 times more TF genes were induced in TN1 than in RHT by BPH. At an FC threshold of >10, there were 37 induced TF genes and 26 constitutive resistance TF genes. Of these, 13 were probably involved in BPH-induced resistance, and 8 in constitutive resistance to BPH in RHT.

CONCLUSIONS: We explored the molecular mechanism of resistance to BPH in rice by comparing expressions of TF genes between RHT and TN1. We speculate that the level of gene repression, especially for early TF genes, plays an important role in the defense response. The fundamental point of the resistance strategy is that plants protect themselves by reducing their metabolic level to inhibit feeding by BPH and prevent damage from water and nutrient loss. We have selected 21 TF genes related to BPH resistance for further analyses to understand the molecular responses to BPH feeding in rice.
23259405	Strand-specific RNA-seq reveals widespread occurrence of novel cis-natural antisense transcripts in rice.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) are RNAs transcribed from the antisense strand of a gene locus, and are complementary to the RNA transcribed from the sense strand. Common techniques including microarray approach and analysis of transcriptome databases are the major ways to globally identify cis-NATs in various eukaryotic organisms. Genome-wide in silico analysis has identified a large number of cis-NATs that may generate endogenous short interfering RNAs (nat-siRNAs), which participate in important biogenesis mechanisms for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in rice. However, the transcriptomes are yet to be deeply sequenced to comprehensively investigate cis-NATs.

RESULTS: We applied high-throughput strand-specific complementary DNA sequencing technology (ssRNA-seq) to deeply sequence mRNA for assessing sense and antisense transcripts that were derived under salt, drought and cold stresses, and normal conditions, in the model plant rice (Oryza sativa). Combined with RAP-DB genome annotation (the Rice Annotation Project Database build-5 data set), 76,013 transcripts corresponding to 45,844 unique gene loci were assembled, in which 4873 gene loci were newly identified. Of 3819 putative rice cis-NATs, 2292 were detected as expressed and giving rise to small RNAs from their overlapping regions through integrated analysis of ssRNA-seq data and small RNA data. Among them, 503 cis-NATs seemed to be associated with specific conditions. The deep sequence data from isolated epidermal cells of rice seedlings further showed that 54.0% of cis-NATs were expressed simultaneously in a population of homogenous cells. Nearly 9.7% of rice transcripts were involved in one-to-one or many-to-many cis-NATs formation. Furthermore, only 17.4-34.7% of 223 many-to-many cis-NAT groups were all expressed and generated nat-siRNAs, indicating that only some cis-NAT groups may be involved in complex regulatory networks.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study profiles an abundance of cis-NATs and nat-siRNAs in rice. These data are valuable for gaining insight into the complex function of the rice transcriptome.
23151797	Aluminium localization and toxicity symptoms related to root growth inhibition in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2012	J Biosci	We correlated root growth inhibition with aluminium (Al(3+)) localization and toxicity symptoms in rice roots using seedlings of two genotypes (tolerant and sensitive) that were exposed to different AlCl(3) concentrations. Al(3+) localization was evaluated by hematoxylin in primary roots and by morin in cross-sections of the root tips. Neutral invertase enzyme activity and callose (1 -- 3, beta-D-glucan) accumulation were observed and compared with Al(3+) accumulation sites. Root growth was inhibited by Al(3+) in a concentration-specific manner and proportional to the increase of hematoxylin staining, being more pronounced in the sensitive genotype. Morin staining showed the presence of Al(3+) deep within the roots of the sensitive genotype, indicating that the metal was able to penetrate beyond the first few cell layers. In the tolerant genotype, Al(3+) penetration was restricted to the first two cell layers. Ruptures in exodermis and epidermis layers by lateral root protrusions in both genotypes allowed Al3+ to enter into the roots. More intense activity of invertase in roots of the tolerant genotype was also observed, which could be related to greater root growth of this cultivar when submitted to Al(3+) stress. Moreover, Al(3+)-induced callose accumulation was a late response occurring in the same areas where Al(3+) was present.
23251532	Live and let die - the B(sister) MADS-box gene OsMADS29 controls the degeneration of cells in maternal tissues during seed development of rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	PLoS One	B(sister) genes have been identified as the closest relatives of class B floral homeotic genes. Previous studies have shown that B(sister) genes from eudicots are involved in cell differentiation during ovule and seed development. However, the complete function of B(sister) genes in eudicots is masked by redundancy with other genes and little is known about the function of B(sister) genes in monocots, and about the evolution of B(sister) gene functions. Here we characterize OsMADS29, one of three MADS-box B(sister) genes in rice. Our analyses show that OsMADS29 is expressed in female reproductive organs including the ovule, ovule vasculature, and the whole seed except for the outer layer cells of the pericarp. Knock-down of OsMADS29 by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) results in shriveled and/or aborted seeds. Histological analyses of the abnormal seeds at 7 days after pollination (DAP) indicate that the symplastic continuity, including the ovular vascular trace and the nucellar projection, which is the nutrient source for the filial tissue at early development stages, is affected. Moreover, degeneration of all the maternal tissues in the transgenic seeds, including the pericarp, ovular vascular trace, integuments, nucellar epidermis and nucellar projection, is blocked as compared to control plants. Our results suggest that OsMADS29 has important functions in seed development of rice by regulating cell degeneration of maternal tissues. Our findings provide important insights into the ancestral function of B(sister) genes.
23246835	Analysis of five rice 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase enzyme activity and stress response for potential roles in lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	4-Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) catalyzes the conversion of hydroxycinnamates into corresponding CoA esters for biosynthesis of flavonoids and lignin. In this study, five members of the 4CL gene family from rice were cloned and analyzed. Recombinant 4CL data revealed that 4-coumaric acid and ferulic acid were the two main substrates of 4CL (Os4CL1/3/4/5) for monolignol biosynthesis in rice. Os4CL2 was specifically expressed in the anther and was strongly activated by UV irradiation, suggesting its potential involvement in flavonoid formation. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis showed that the existence of valine residue at the substrate-binding pocket may mainly affect rice 4CL activities toward sinapic acid.
23231430	Heterologous expression of OsSIZ1, a rice SUMO E3 ligase, enhances broad abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic creeping bentgrass.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Sumoylation is a posttranslational regulatory process in higher eukaryotes modifying substrate proteins through conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs). Sumoylation modulates protein stability, subcellular localization and activity; thus, it regulates most cellular functions including response to environmental stress in plants. To study the feasibility of manipulating SUMO E3 ligase, one of the important components in the sumoylation pathway in transgenic (TG) crop plants for improving overall plant performance under adverse environmental conditions, we have analysed TG creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) plants constitutively expressing OsSIZ1, a rice SUMO E3 ligase. Overexpression of OsSIZ1 led to increased photosynthesis and overall plant growth. When subjected to water deficiency and heat stress, OsSIZ1 plants exhibited drastically enhanced performance associated with more robust root growth, higher water retention and cell membrane integrity than wild-type (WT) controls. OsSIZ1 plants also displayed significantly better growth than WT controls under phosphate-starvation conditions, which was associated with a higher uptake of phosphate (Pi) and other minerals, such as potassium and zinc. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of OsSIZ1 enhanced stress-induced SUMO conjugation to substrate in TG plants, which was associated with modified expression of stress-related genes. This strongly supports a role sumoylation plays in regulating multiple molecular pathways involved in plant stress response, establishing a direct link between sumoylation and plant response to environmental adversities. Our results demonstrate the great potential of genetic manipulation of sumoylation process in TG crop species for improved resistance to broad abiotic stresses.
23231455	Altered expression of the PTR/NRT1 homologue OsPTR9 affects nitrogen utilization efficiency, growth and grain yield in rice.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	The plant PTR/NRT1 (peptide transporter/nitrate transporter 1) gene family comprises di/tripeptide and low-affinity nitrate transporters; some members also recognize other substrates such as carboxylates, phytohormones (auxin and abscisic acid), or defence compounds (glucosinolates). Little is known about the members of this gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report the influence of altered OsPTR9 expression on nitrogen utilization efficiency, growth, and grain yield. OsPTR9 expression is regulated by exogenous nitrogen and by the day-night cycle. Elevated expression of OsPTR9 in transgenic rice plants resulted in enhanced ammonium uptake, promotion of lateral root formation and increased grain yield. On the other hand, down-regulation of OsPTR9 in a T-DNA insertion line (osptr9) and in OsPTR9-RNAi rice plants had the opposite effect. These results suggest that OsPTR9 might hold potential for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and grain yield in rice breeding.
23230509	Multiple roles of the ER stress sensor IRE1 demonstrated by gene targeting in rice.	2012	Sci Rep	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor, IRE1, contains a kinase domain and a ribonuclease domain. Ribonuclease mediates the unconventional splicing of mRNA encoding the transcription factor AtbZIP60 in Arabidopsis, or OsbZIP50 in rice, and thereby transduces signals from stressed ER. Here, we demonstrate the additional roles of plant IRE1 using genetically modified rice plants. Using a gene targeting system based on homologous recombination, genomic IRE1 was replaced with two types of missense alleles, leading to a defect in the kinase or ribonuclease activity of IRE1. Genetic analysis of these alleles demonstrated that the kinase activity of IRE1 plays a vital role independent of ribonuclease activity. Furthermore, the existence of ribonuclease substrates other than OsbZIP50 mRNA is demonstrated for the first time. This study provides new insights into higher plant signalling using a gene targeting approach.
23203411	Genetic dissection of rice blast resistance by QTL mapping approach using an F3 population.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Rice blast is one of the major fungal diseases that badly reduce rice production in Asia including Malaysia. There is not much information on identification of QTLs as well as linked markers and their association with blast resistance within local rice cultivars. In order to understanding of the genetic control of blast in the F3 families from indica rice cross Pongsu seribu2/Mahsuri, an analysis of quantitative trait loci against one of the highly virulent Malaysian rice blast isolate Magnaporthe oryzae, P5.0 was carried out. Result indicated that partial resistance to this pathotype observed in the present study was controlled by multiple loci or different QTLs. In QTL analysis in F3 progeny fifteen QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11 and 12 for resistance to blast nursery tests was identified. Three of detected QTLs (qRBr-6.1, qRBr-11.4, and qRBr-12.1) had significant threshold (LOD >3) and approved by both IM and CIM methods. Twelve suggestive QTLs, qRBr-1.2, qRBr-2.1, qRBr-4.1, qRBr-5.1, qRBr-6.2, qRBr-6.3, qRBr-8.1, qRBr-10.1, qRBr-10.2, qRBr-11.1, qRBr-11.2 and qRBr-11.3) with Logarithmic of Odds (LOD) <3.0 or LRS <15) were distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11. Most of the QTLs detected using single isolate had the resistant alleles from Pongsu seribu 2 which involved in the resistance in the greenhouse. We found that QTLs detected for deferent traits for the using isolate were frequently located in similar genomic regions. Inheritance study showed among F3 lines resistance segregated in the expected ratio of 15: 1 for resistant to susceptible. The average score for blast resistance measured in the green house was 3.15, 1.98 and 29.95 % for three traits, BLD, BLT and % DLA, respectively.
23342502	Comparison of microsatellites and isozymes in genetic diversity studies of Oryza glumaepatula (Poaceae) populations.	2012	Rev Biol Trop	The study of the genetic structure of wild plant populations is essential for their management and conservation. Several DNA markers have been used in such studies, as well as isozyme markers. In order to provide a better comprehension of the results obtained and a comparison between markers which will help choose tools for future studies in natural populations of Oryza glumaepatula, a predominantly autogamous species, this study used both isozymes and microsatellites to assess the genetic diversity and genetic structure of 13 populations, pointing to similarities and divergences of each marker, and evaluating the relative importance of the results for studies of population genetics and conservation. A bulk sample for each population was obtained, by sampling two to three seeds of each plant, up to a set of 50 seeds. Amplified products of eight SSR loci were electrophoresed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the fragments were visualized using silver staining procedure. Isozyme analyses were conducted in polyacrylamide gels, under a discontinuous system, using six enzymatic loci. SSR loci showed higher mean levels of genetic diversity (A=2.83, p=0.71, A(p)=3.17, H(o)=0.081, H(e)=0.351) than isozyme loci (A=1.20, p=0.20, A(p)=1.38, H(o)=0.006, H(e)=0.056). Interpopulation genetic differentiation detected by SSR loci (R(ST)=0.631, equivalent to F(ST)=0.533) was lower than that obtained with isozymes (F(ST)=0.772). However, both markers showed high deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations (F(IS)=0.744 and 0.899, respectively for SSR and isozymes). The mean apparent outcrossing rate for SSR (t(a)=0.14) was higher than that obtained using isozymes (t(a)=0.043), although both markers detected lower levels of outcrossing in Amazonia compared to the Pantanal. The migrant number estimation was also higher for SSR (Nm=0.219) than isozymes (Nm=0.074), although a small number for both markers was expected due to the mode of reproduction of this species, defined as mixed with predominance of self fertilization. No correlation was obtained between genetic and geographic distances with SSR, but a positive correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances with isozymes. We conclude that these markers are divergent in detecting genetic diversity parameters in O. glumaepatula and that microsatellites are powerful for detecting information at the intra-population level, while isozymes are more powerful for inter-population diversity, since clustering of populations agreed with the expectations based on the geographic distribution of the populations using this marker.
23267064	TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Inflorescence structures result from the activities of meristems, which coordinate both the renewal of stem cells in the center and organ formation at the periphery. The fate of a meristem is specified at its initiation and changes as the plant develops. During rice inflorescence development, newly formed meristems acquire a branch meristem (BM) identity, and can generate further meristems or terminate as spikelets. Thus, the form of rice inflorescence is determined by a reiterative pattern of decisions made at the meristems. In the dominant gain-of-function mutant tawawa1-D, the activity of the inflorescence meristem (IM) is extended and spikelet specification is delayed, resulting in prolonged branch formation and increased numbers of spikelets. In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1) activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in the generation of small inflorescences. TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs. TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs). We also demonstrate that members of the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE subfamily of MADS-box genes function downstream of TAW1. We thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity and suppression of the phase change to SM identity.
23270672	Antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic α-helical dodecapeptide, a partial sequence of cyanate lyase from rice.	2013	Peptides	CL(14-25), a dodecapeptide, that is a partial region near N-terminus of cyanate lyase (CL, EC 4.3.99.1) from rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica), contains three arginine and two lysine residues. It was a novel cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptide. The antimicrobial activity of CL(14-25) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, was quantitatively evaluated by a chemiluminescence method that measures ATP derived from viable cells. The 50% growth-inhibitory concentration of CL(14-25) against P. gingivalis cells was 145 μM. CL(14-25), even at a concentration of 800 μM, had no hemolytic activity. When giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that mimic the membrane composition of Gram-negative bacteria were used, microscopy image analysis suggested that CL(14-25) disrupted GUVs in a detergent-like manner. Therefore, CL(14-25) appears to exhibit antimicrobial activity through membrane disruption. To investigate the contribution of cationic amino acid residues in CL(14-25) to its antimicrobial activity, we synthesized four truncated CL analogs, in which one or two cationic amino acid residues were deleted from the N- and C- termini of CL(14-25). The degrees of calcein leakage from large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (diSC3-5) release from P. gingivalis cells induced by truncated CL analogs were closely related to their antimicrobial activities. CL analogs, which were truncated by removing an arginine residue from the N-terminus and a lysine residue from the C-terminus maintained their antimicrobial activity. However, CL analogs, which were further truncated by removing two arginine residues from the N-terminus, and an arginine and a lysine residue from the C-terminus, rarely exhibited antimicrobial activity.
23236455	QTL analysis of Na+ and K+ concentrations in roots and shoots under different levels of NaCl stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	The key to plant survival under NaCl salt stress is maintaining a low Na(+) level or Na(+)/K(+) ratio in the cells. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F(2:9)) derived from a cross between the salt-tolerant japonica rice variety Jiucaiqing and the salt-sensitive indica variety IR26, was used to determine Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in the roots and shoots under three different NaCl stress conditions (0, 100 and 120 mM NaCl). A total of nine additive QTLs were identified by QTL Cartographer program using single-environment phenotypic values, whereas eight additive QTLs were identified by QTL IciMapping program. Among these additive QTLs, five were identified by both programs. Epistatic QTLs and QTL-by-environment interactions were detected by QTLNetwork program in the joint analyses of multi-environment phenotypic values, and one additive QTL and nine epistatic QTLs were identified. There were three epistatic QTLs identified for Na(+) in roots (RNC), three additive QTLs and two epistatic QTLs identified for Na(+) in shoots (SNC), four additive QTLs identified for K(+) in roots (RKC), four additive QTLs and three epistatic QTLs identified for K(+) in shoots (SKC) and one additive QTL and one epistatic QTL for salt tolerance rating (STR). The phenotypic variation explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL×environment interaction ranged from 8.5 to 18.9%, 0.5 to 5.3% and 0.7 to 7.5%, respectively. By comparing the chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, five additive QTLs, qSNC9, qSKC1, qSKC9, qRKC4 and qSTR7, might represent novel salt tolerance loci. The identification of salt tolerance in selected RILs showed that a major QTL qSNC11 played a significant role in rice salt tolerance, and could be used to improve salt tolerance of commercial rice varieties with marker-assisted selection (MAS) approach.
23284907	Early mixed farming of millet and rice 7800 years ago in the Middle Yellow River region, China.	2012	PLoS One	The Peiligang Culture (9000-7000 cal. yr BP) in the Middle Yellow River region, North China, has long been considered representative of millet farming. It is still unclear, however, if broomcorn millet or foxtail millet was the first species domesticated during the Peiligang Culture. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether millet was cultivated singly or together with rice at the same period. In this study, phytolith analysis of samples from the Tanghu archaeological site reveals early crop information in the Middle Yellow River region, China. Our results show that broomcorn millet was the early dry farming species in the Peiligang Culture at 7800 cal. yr BP, while rice cultivation took place from 7800 to 4500 cal. yr BP. Our data provide new evidence of broomcorn millet and rice mixed farming at 7800 cal. yr BP in the Middle Yellow River region, which has implications for understanding the domestication process of the two crops, and the formation and continuance of the Ancient Yellow River Civilization.
23248203	Structural, expression and interaction analysis of rice SKP1-like genes.	2013	DNA Res	The degradation of proteins by the 26S proteasome is initiated by protein polyubiquitination mediated by a three-step cascade. The specific ubiquitination of different target proteins is mediated by different classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, among which the best known are Skp1-Cullin-F-box complexes. Whereas protists, fungi and some vertebrates have a single SKP1 gene, many animal and plant species possess multiple SKP1 homologues. In this paper, we report on the structure, phylogeny and expression of the complete set of rice SKP1 genes (OSKs, Oryza sativa SKP1-like genes). Our analyses indicated that OSK1 and OSK20 belong to a class of SKP1 genes that contain one intron at a conserved position and are highly expressed. In addition, our yeast two-hybrid results revealed that OSK proteins display a differing ability to interact with F-box proteins. However, OSK1 and OSK20 seemed to interact with most of the nine F-box proteins tested. We suggest that rice OSK1 and OSK20 are likely to have functions similar to the Arabidopsis ASK1 and ASK2 genes.
23262107	[Mapping QTL for rice milling and appearance quality traits in indica rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	Quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling six milling and appearance quality traits were analyzed over 2 years using recombinant inbred lines derived from two indica rice Teqing and IRBB. A total of 30 QTL for these traits were detected, of which eight were for brown rice rate (BRR), two for milled rice recovery (MRR), two for head rice recovery (HRR), seven for grain length (GL), five for grain width (GW), and six for length/width ratio (LWR). The QTL were distributed on all chromosomes except for chromosomes 4 and 12. A QTL cluster with major effects on GL, LWR, BRR, and HRR was located in the RM15139-RM15303 interval on chromosome 3, which includes the GS3 gene for grain size. The phenotypic variances explained by the QTL were 59.51%, 36.68%, 19.51%, and 4.56%, respectively. QTL affecting GW, LWR, BRR, and MRR were clustered in the RM437-RM18038 region of chromosome 5,which covers the GW5 gene for grain width, and contributed 59.51%, 36.68%, 19.51%, and 4.56% to the total variance. QTL with minor effects on BRR and MRR were mapped to the RM190-RM587 interval covering the Wx gene for amylase content on chromosome 6. These results suggest that GS3 and GW5 may play a major roles in the genetic control of BRR and grain shape.
23215967	Internal aeration of paddy field rice (Oryza sativa) during complete submergence---importance of light and floodwater O2.	2013	New Phytol	Flash floods can submerge paddy field rice (Oryza sativa), with adverse effects on internal aeration, sugar status and survival. Here, we investigated the in situ aeration of roots of rice during complete submergence, and elucidated how underwater photosynthesis and floodwater pO(2) influence root aeration in anoxic soil. In the field, root pO(2) was measured using microelectrodes during 2 d of complete submergence. Leaf gas films that formed on the superhydrophobic leaves were left intact, or experimentally removed, to elucidate their effect on internal aeration. In darkness, root pO(2) declined to very low concentrations (0.24 kPa) and was strongly correlated with floodwater pO(2). In light, root pO(2) was high (14 kPa) and primarily a function of the incident light determining the rates of underwater net photosynthesis. Plants with intact leaf gas films maintained higher underwater net photosynthesis relative to plants without gas films when the submerged shoots were in light. During complete submergence, internal aeration of rice in the field relies on underwater photosynthesis during the day and entry of O(2) from the floodwater during the night. Leaf gas films enhance photosynthesis during submergence leading to improved O(2) production and sugar status, and therefore contribute to the submergence tolerance of rice.
23326259	Molecular Breeding to Improve Salt Tolerance of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the Red River Delta of Vietnam.	2012	Int J Plant Genomics	Rice is a stable food in Vietnam and plays a key role in the economy of the country. However, the production and the cultivating areas are adversely affected from the threats of devastation caused by the rise of sea level. Using marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) to develop a new salt tolerance rice cultivar is one of the feasible methods to cope with these devastating changes. To improve rice salt tolerance in BT7 cultivar, FL478 was used as a donor parent to introgress the Saltol QTL conferring salt tolerance into BT7. Three backcrosses were conducted and successfully transferred positive alleles of Saltol from FL478 into BT7. The plants numbers IL-30 and IL-32 in BC(3)F(1) population expected recurrent genome recovery of up to 99.2% and 100%, respectively. These selected lines that carried the Saltol alleles were screened in field for their agronomic traits. All improved lines had Saltol allele similar to the donor parent FL478, whereas their agronomic performances were the same as the original BT7. We show here the success of improving rice salt tolerance by MABC and the high efficiency of selection in early generations. In the present study, MABC has accelerated the development of superior qualities in the genetic background of BT7.
23242918	Expression of the chimeric receptor between the chitin elicitor receptor CEBiP and the receptor-like protein kinase Pi-d2 leads to enhanced responses to the chitin elicitor and disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	We previously reported that rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor consisting of rice chitin oligosaccharides binding protein (CEBiP) and the intracellular protein kinase region of Xa21, which confers resistance to rice bacterial blight, showed enhanced cellular responses to a chitin elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose and increased resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we investigated whether CEBiP fused with another type of receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) also functions as a chimeric receptor. Fusion proteins CRPis consist of CEBiP and the intracellular protein kinase region of a true resistance gene Pi-d2. Transgenic rice expressing a CRPi showed enhanced cellular responses specifically to N-acetylchitoheptaose in cultured cells and increased levels of disease resistance against M. oryzae in plants. These responses depended on the amino acid sequences predicted to be essential for the protein kinase activity of CRPi. The structure of the transmembrane domain in CRPi affected the protein accumulation, cellular responses, and disease resistance in transgenic rice. These results suggest that the chimeric receptor consisting of CEBiP and Pi-d2 functions as a receptor for chitin oligosaccharides and CEBiP-based chimeric receptors fused with other RLKs may also act as functional receptors.
23205731	Similar traits, different genes? Examining convergent evolution in related weedy rice populations.	2013	Mol Ecol	Convergent phenotypic evolution may or may not be associated with convergent genotypic evolution. Agricultural weeds have repeatedly been selected for weed-adaptive traits such as rapid growth, increased seed dispersal and dormancy, thus providing an ideal system for the study of convergent evolution. Here, we identify QTL underlying weedy traits and compare their genetic architecture to assess the potential for convergent genetic evolution in two distinct populations of weedy rice. F(2) offspring from crosses between an indica cultivar and two individuals from genetically differentiated U.S. weedy rice populations were used to map QTL for four quantitative (heading date, seed shattering, plant height and growth rate) and two qualitative traits. We identified QTL on nine of the twelve rice chromosomes, yet most QTL locations do not overlap between the two populations. Shared QTL among weed groups were only seen for heading date, a trait for which weedy groups have diverged from their cultivated ancestors and from each other. Sharing of some QTL with wild rice also suggests a possible role in weed evolution for genes under selection during domestication. The lack of overlapping QTL for the remaining traits suggests that, despite a close evolutionary relationship, weedy rice groups have adapted to the same agricultural environment through different genetic mechanisms.
23341744	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of LH1 and LH2, a set of complementary genes controlling late heading in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Breed Sci	Heading date in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a critical agronomic trait with a complex inheritance. To investigate the genetic basis and mechanism of gene interaction in heading date, we conducted genetic analysis on segregation populations derived from crosses among the indica cultivars Bo B, Yuefeng B and Baoxuan 2. A set of dominant complementary genes controlling late heading, designated LH1 and LH2, were detected by molecular marker mapping. Genetic analysis revealed that Baoxuan 2 contains both dominant genes, while Bo B and Yuefeng B each possess either LH1 or LH2. Using larger populations with segregant ratios of 3 : 1, we fine-mapped LH1 to a 63-kb region near the centromere of chromosome 7 flanked by markers RM5436 and RM8034, and LH2 to a 177-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 8 between flanking markers Indel22468-3 and RM25. Some candidate genes were identified through sequencing of Bo B and Yuefeng B in these target regions. Our work provides a solid foundation for further study on gene interaction in heading date and has application in marker-assisted breeding of photosensitive hybrid rice in China.

23220695	ABCG15 encodes an ABC transporter protein, and is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen exine development in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	In flowering plants, anther and pollen development is critical for male reproductive success. The anther cuticle and pollen exine play an essential role, and in many cereals, such as rice, orbicules/ubisch bodies are also thought to be important for pollen development. The formation of the anther cuticle, exine and orbicules is associated with the biosynthesis and transport of wax, cutin and sporopollenin components. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of sporopollenin and cutin components in Arabidopsis and rice, but less is known about the mechanisms by which they are transported to the sites of deposition. Here, we report that the rice ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG15, is essential for post-meiotic anther and pollen development, and is proposed to play a role in the transport of rice anther cuticle and sporopollenin precursors. ABCG15 is highly expressed in the tapetum at the young microspore stage, and the abcg15 mutant exhibits small, white anthers lacking mature pollen, lipidic cuticle, orbicules and pollen exine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the abcg15 anther cuticle revealed significant reductions in a number of wax components and aliphatic cutin monomers. The expression level of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the abcg15 mutant was significantly different from their levels in the wild type, possibly due to perturbations in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism. Our study provides new insights for understanding the molecular mechanism of the formation of the anther cuticle, orbicules and pollen wall, as well as the machinery for lipid metabolism in rice anthers.
23285082	Development of genetic markers linked to straighthead resistance through fine mapping in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	Straighthead, a physiological disorder characterized by sterile florets and distorted spikelets, causes significant yield losses in rice, and occurs in many countries. The current control method of draining paddies early in the season stresses plants, is costly, and wastes water. Development of resistant cultivar is regarded as the most efficient way for its control. We mapped a QTL for straighthead resistance using two recombinant inbred line (RIL) F(9) populations that were phenotyped over two years using monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) to induce the symptoms. One population of 170 RILs was genotyped with 136 SSRs and the other population of 91 RILs was genotyped with 159 SSRs. A major QTL qSH-8 was identified in an overlapping region in both populations, and explained 46% of total variation in one and 67% in another population for straighthead resistance. qSH-8 was fine mapped from 1.0 Mbp to 340 kb using 7 SSR markers and further mapped to 290 kb in a population between RM22573 and InDel 27 using 4 InDel markers. SSR AP3858-1 and InDel 11 were within the fine mapped region, and co-segregated with straighthead resistance in both RIL populations, as well as in a collection of diverse global accessions. These results demonstrate that AP3858-1 and InDel 11 can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for straighthead resistant cultivars, which is especially important because there is no effective way to directly evaluate straighthead resistance.
23083333	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice.	2013	Plant J	Flowering is exquisitely regulated by both promotive and inhibitory factors. Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis have verified several epigenetic repressors that regulate flowering time. However, the roles of chromatin remodeling factors in developmental processes have not been well explored in Oryza sativa (rice). We identified a chromatin remodeling factor OsVIL2 (O. sativa VIN3-LIKE 2) that promotes flowering. OsVIL2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a conserved motif of histone binding proteins. Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days. In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced. We demonstrated that OsVIL2 is bound to native histone H3 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin. We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants. These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression. We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2. As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression. Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1.
23220823	OsDGL1, a homolog of an oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit, is involved in N-glycosylation and root development in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	A leaky rice mutant was isolated from an ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized rice library based on its short root phenotype. The map-based cloning results showed that the mutant was due to a point mutation in the intron of OsDGL1 (LOC_Os07g10830), which encodes the dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit precursor. The mutation results in premature termination of protein synthesis. OsDGL1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis DGL1, human OST48 and yeast WBP1, an essential protein subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in N-glycosylation in eukaryotes. The leaky rice mutant, Osdgl1, displayed a change of matrix polysaccharides in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, smaller root meristem and cell death in the root. Consistent with the known function of the OST complex in eukaryotes, the Osdgl1 mutation leads to a defect in N-glycosylation in the root. It was also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be involved in this process.
23202132	The SNAC1-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	Abiotic stresses such as drought cause a reduction of plant growth and loss of crop yield. Stomatal aperture controls CO(2) uptake and water loss to the atmosphere, thus playing important roles in both the yield gain and drought tolerance of crops. Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response. SNAC1 could bind to the promoter of OsSRO1c and activate the expression of OsSRO1c. OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress. The loss-of-function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss. Interestingly, OsSRO1c-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Expression of DST, a reported zinc finger gene negatively regulating H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure, and the activity of H(2)O(2)-scavenging related enzymes were significantly suppressed, and H(2)O(2) in guard cells was accumulated in the overexpression lines. OsSRO1c interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance. The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.
23251677	The rice R2R3-MYB transcription factor OsMYB55 is involved in the tolerance to high temperature and modulates amino acid metabolism.	2012	PLoS One	Temperatures higher than the optimum negatively affects plant growth and development. Tolerance to high temperature is a complex process that involves several pathways. Understanding this process, especially in crops such as rice, is essential to prepare for predicted climate changes due to global warming. Here, we show that OsMYB55 is induced by high temperature and overexpression of OsMYB55 resulted in improved plant growth under high temperature and decreased the negative effect of high temperature on grain yield. Transcriptome analysis revealed an increase in expression of several genes involved in amino acids metabolism. We demonstrate that OsMYB55 binds to the promoter regions of target genes and directly activates expression of some of those genes including glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;2) glutamine amidotransferase (GAT1) and glutamate decarboxylase 3 (GAD3). OsMYB55 overexpression resulted in an increase in total amino acid content and of the individual amino acids produced by the activation of the above mentioned genes and known for their roles in stress tolerance, namely L-glutamic acid, GABA and arginine especially under high temperature condition. In conclusion, overexpression of OsMYB55 improves rice plant tolerance to high temperature, and this high tolerance is associated with enhanced amino acid metabolism through transcription activation.
23221779	Genome-wide analysis of glutathione reductase (GR) genes from rice and Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Plant cells and tissues remain always on risk under abiotic and biotic stresses due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Plants protect themselves against ROS induced oxidative damage by the upregulation of antioxidant machinery. Out of many components of antioxidant machinery, glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) and glutathione (GSH, γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) play important role in the protection of cell against oxidative damage. In stress condition, the GR helps in maintaining the reduced glutathione pool for strengthening the antioxidative processes in plants. Present study investigates genome wide analysis of GR from rice and Arabidopsis. We were able to identify 3 rice GR genes (LOC_Os02 g56850, LOC_Os03 g06740, LOC_Os10 g28000) and 2 Arabidopsis GR genes (AT3G54660, AT3G24170) from their respective genomes on the basis of their annotation as well as the presence of pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases class-I active site. The evolutionary relationship of the GR genes from rice and Arabidopsis genomes was analyzed using the multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. This revealed evolutionary conserved pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases class-I active site among the GR protein in rice and Arabidopsis. This study should make an important contribution to our better understanding of the GR under normal and stress condition in plants.
23262670	MKRN expression pattern during embryonic and post-embryonic organogenesis in rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare).	2013	Planta	Rice MKRN is a member of the makorin RING finger protein gene (MKRN) family, which encodes a protein with a characteristic array of zinc-finger motifs conserved in various eukaryotes. Using non-radioactive in situ hybridization, we investigated the spatio-temporal gene expression pattern of rice MKRN during embryogenesis, imbibition, seminal and lateral root development of Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare. MKRN expression was ubiquitous during early organogenesis in the embryo along the apical-basal and radial axes. The expression of MKRN decreased during embryonic organ elongation and maturation compared to early embryogenesis, but increased again during imbibition. Tissue-specific and position-dependent MKRN expression was found during embryonic and post-embryonic root and shoot development. Meristematic cells ubiquitously expressed MKRN transcripts, while differentiating cells showed a gradual reduction and termination of MKRN expression. Interestingly, during post-germination MKRN expression was prominent and continued in the metabolically active, differentiated companion cells of the phloem. The differential expression pattern was observed both in the differentiating and differentiated cells. Also, MKRN was expressed in the various developmental stages of the lateral root primordia and the cells surrounding them. Expression of MKRN was also observed after periclinal division of the presumptive pericycle founder cells. The MKRN expression pattern during development of various growth stages suggests an important role of makorin RING finger protein gene (MKRN) in embryonic and post-embryonic organogenesis in both apical-basal and radial developmental axes of rice.
23341747	Close linkage of a blast resistance gene, Pias(t), with a bacterial leaf blight resistance gene, Xa1-as(t), in a rice cultivar 'Asominori'.	2012	Breed Sci	It has long been known that a bacterial leaf blight-resistant line in rice obtained from a crossing using 'Asominori' as a resistant parent also has resistance to blast, but a blast resistance gene in 'Asominori' has not been investigated in detail. In the present study, a blast resistance gene in 'Asominori', tentatively named Pias(t), was revealed to be located within 162-kb region between DNA markers YX4-3 and NX4-1 on chromosome 4 and to be linked with an 'Asominori' allele of the bacterial leaf blight resistance gene Xa1, tentatively named Xa1-as(t). An 'Asominori' allele of Pias(t) was found to be dominant and difference of disease severity between lines having the 'Asominori' allele of Pias(t) and those without it was 1.2 in disease index from 0 to 10. Pias(t) was also closely linked with the Ph gene controlling phenol reaction, suggesting the possibility of successful selection of blast resistance using the phenol reaction. Since blast-resistant commercial cultivars have been developed using 'Asominori' as a parent, Pias(t) is considered to be a useful gene in rice breeding for blast resistance.
23376844	Expression and characterization of recombinant human alpha-antitrypsin in transgenic rice seed.	2012	J Biotechnol	Human alpha-antitrypsin (AAT) is the most abundant circulating protease inhibitor in the human plasma. It is produced in the liver and exerts a primary physiological role as inhibitor for the neutrophil elastase in the lung. Individuals with one or several gene mutations in AAT causing reduction of the protein are related to lung, liver and pancreatic emphysema diseases and are treated lifelong with infusions of human plasma-derived AAT. Due to shortage of plasma and low expression levels of recombinant AAT in conventional gene expression systems, we explored the possibility to produce recombinant AAT in rice grains (Oryza sativa AAT, OsrAAT). An expression level of up to 2.24g/kg brown rice and a final recovery of purified 0.366g/kg OsrAAT has been obtained. OsrAAT has the same secondary structure and protease inhibitory activity as plasma-derived AAT (pAAT), but was highly heterogeneous with regard to glycan modifications. Thus 32.8% of OsrAAT were glycosylated and 67.2% were free of glycans as determined by MALDI-MS. Of the N-glycan structures 64.8% were vacuole-specific paucimannosidic molecules. Immune electron microscopy located OsrAAT in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen as precursor-accumulating (PAC)-like vesicle structures. The pharmacokinetic study indicated that the half-life of OsrAAT was prolonged, while the clearance rate was faster than that of pAAT in vivo. The results demonstrate that rice endosperm is a promising system to express this biopharmaceutical protein.
23313793	Rice heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (RGA1): in silico analysis of the gene and promoter and its upregulation under abiotic stress.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Heterotrimeric G-protein complexes (Gα, Gβ and Gγ) operate at the apex of diverse signal transduction systems along with their cognate transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and appropriate downstream effectors in the plant. Rice Gα in response to stress has not been well studied. Here, we report the in silico analysis of Gα subunit from Oryza sativa cv. Indica group Swarna [RGA1(I), accession number HQ634688], its promoter and its transcript upregulation in response to abiotic stresses. Genomic sequence of RGA1(I) contains thirteen exonic and twelve intronic segments. Phylogenetic analysis of RGA1(I) demonstrated high homology with Sorghum and maize and is distantly related to barley and wheat. Promoter sequence analysis of RGA1(I) confirms the presence of stress-related cis-regulatory elements viz. ABA, MeJAE, ARE, GT-1 boxes and LTR suggesting its active and possible independent roles in abiotic stress signalling. Expasy PROSITE database of protein families and domains revealed important motifs, patterns and biologically significant sites in RGA1(I). Three dimensional structure of RGA1(I) protein predicted by I-TASSER server and its stereochemical qualities were validated by PROCHECK and QMEAN server indicating the acceptability of the predicted model. The transcript profiling of RGA1(I) showed upregulation following NaCl, cold and drought stress. Under elevated temperature, its transcript was down regulated. Heavy metal(loid)s stress showed rhythmic and strong upregulation. It showed a rhythmic response in ABA stress. These findings provide a critical evidence for its active role in regulation of abiotic stresses in rice. These findings suggest its possible exploitation in the development of abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
23210861	Characterization and genetic analysis of a novel rice spotted-leaf mutant HM47 with broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	A stable inherited rice spotted-leaf mutant HM47 derived from an EMS-induced IR64 mutant bank was identified. The mutant expressed hypersensitive response (HR)-like symptoms throughout its whole life from the first leaf to the flag leaf, without pathogen invasion. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light under natural summer field conditions. Expression of pathogenesis-related genes including PAL, PO-C1, POX22.3 and PBZ1 was enhanced significantly in association with cell death and accumulation of H2 O2 at and around the site of lesions in the mutant in contrast to that in the wild-type (WT). Disease reaction to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae from the Philippines and China showed that HM47 is a broad-spectrum disease-resistant mutant with enhanced resistance to multiple races of bacterial blight pathogens tested. An F2 progeny test showed that bacterial blight resistance to race HB-17 was co-segregated with the expression of lesions. Genetic analysis indicated that the spotted-leaf trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named spl(HM47) , flanked by two insertion/deletion markers in a region of approximately 74 kb on the long arm of chromosome 4. Ten open reading frames are predicted, and all of them are expressed proteins. Isolation and validation of the putative genes are currently underway.
23220350	Haplotype variation at Badh2, the gene determining fragrance in rice.	2013	Genomics	Fragrance is an important component of end-use quality in rice. A set of 516 fragrant rice accessions were genotyped and over 80% of them carried the badh2.7 allele. A subset of 144 mostly fragrant accessions, including nine of Oryza rufipogon, was then subjected to a detailed diversity and haplotype analysis. The level of linkage disequilibrium in the Badh2 region was higher among the fragrant accessions. Re-sequencing in the Badh2 region showed that badh2.7, badh2.2 and badh2.4-5 all arose in the japonica genepool, and spread later into the indica genepool as a result of deliberate crossing. However, loss-of-function alleles of Badh2 are also found in the indica genepools, and then transferred into japonica. Evidence for three new possible FNPs was obtained from the Badh2 sequence of 62 fragrant accessions. Based on these data, we have elaborated a model for the evolution of Badh2 and its participation in the rice domestication process.
23300690	A 90-day dietary toxicity study of genetically modified rice T1C-1 expressing Cry1C protein in Sprague Dawley rats.	2012	PLoS One	In a 90-day study, Sprague Dawley rats were fed transgenic T1C-1 rice expressing Cry1C protein and were compared with rats fed non-transgenic parental rice Minghui 63 and rats fed a basal diet. No adverse effects on animal behavior or weight gain were observed during the study. Blood samples were collected and analyzed, and standard hematological and biochemical parameters were compared. A few of these parameters were found to be significantly different, but were within the normal reference intervals for rats of this breed and age, and were thus not considered to be treatment-related. Following sacrifice, a large number of organs were weighed, and macroscopic and histopathological examinations were performed with no changes reported. The aim of this study was to use a known animal model to determine the safety of the genetically modified (GM) rice T1C-1. The results showed no adverse or toxic effects due to T1C-1 rice when tested in this 90-day study.
23256151	Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice is a major staple food worldwide. Making hybrid rice has proved to be an effective strategy to significantly increase grain yield. Current hybrid rice technologies rely on male sterile lines and have been used predominantly in indica cultivars. However, intrinsic problems exist in the implementation of these technologies, such as limited germplasms and unpredictable conversions from sterility to fertility in the field. Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development. This mutation was introduced into indica and japonica rice, and it rendered male sterility under short-day conditions and male fertility under long-day conditions in both lines. Furthermore, F(1) plants of csa and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice. The csa-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture.
23285081	Pleiotropism of the photoperiod-insensitive allele of Hd1 on heading date, plant height and yield traits in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Five populations segregated in isogenic backgrounds and three sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) overlapping in a 362.3-kb region covering heading date gene Hd1 were developed from the indica rice cross Zhenshan97 (ZS97)/Milyang 46 (MY46). They were used to analyze the effects of Hd1 on heading date, plant height and yield traits. In a background of the parental mixtures, the photoperiod-sensitive allele derived from ZS97 functioned in promoting and delaying flowering in the natural short-day and long-day conditions, respectively. In the background of ZS97, no response to the photoperiod was observed, whereas the photoperiod-insensitive allele derived from MY46 functioned in delaying flowering, increasing plant height, and enhancing grain productivity. The additive effects estimated in two NIL sets were 6.14 and 6.14 d for heading date, 4.46 and 5.55 cm for plant height, 10.82 and 11.54 for the number of spikelets per panicle, 6.82 and 8.00 for the number of grains per panicle, and 2.16 and 2.23 g for grain yield per plant, which explained 94.1% and 96.3%, 70.5% and 84.8%, 52.4% and 55.2%, 28.9% and 39.2%, and 36.5% and 26.9% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. Since the photoperiod-insensitive allele of Hd1 confers a long vegetative phase, it is a good candidate for breeding rice varieties with high yielding potential for low latitudes.
23233857	Role of Rice Stripe Virus NSvc4 in Cell-to-Cell Movement and Symptom Development in Nicotiana benthamiana.	2012	Front Plant Sci	Our previous work has demonstrated that the NSvc4 protein of Rice stripe virus (RSV) functions as a cell-to-cell movement protein. However, the mechanisms whereby RSV traffics through plasmodesmata (PD) are unknown. Here we provide evidence that the NSvc4 moves on the actin filament and endoplasmic reticulum network, but not microtubules, to reach cell wall PD. Disruption of cytoskeleton using different inhibitors altered NSvc4 localization to PD, thus impeding RSV infection of Nicotiana benthamiana. Sequence analyses and deletion mutagenesis experiment revealed that the N-terminal 125 amino acids (AAs) of the NSvc4 determine PD targeting and that a transmembrane domain spanning AAs 106-125 is critical for PD localization. We also found that the NSvc4 protein can localize to chloroplasts in infected cells. Analyses using deletion mutants revealed that the N-terminal 73 AAs are essential for chloroplast localization. Furthermore, expression of NSvc4 from a Potato virus X (PVX) vector resulted in more severe disease symptoms than PVX alone in systemically infected N. benthamiana leaves. Expression of NSvc4 in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells did not elicit tubule formation, but instead resulted in punctate foci at the plasma membrane. These findings shed new light on our understanding of the movement mechanisms whereby RSV infects host plants.
23135854	Phenotypic and physiological evaluation for drought and salinity stress responses in rice.	2013	Methods Mol Biol	Drought and salinity stresses seriously affect rice plant growth and yield. The growing need to improve rice cultivars for drought and salt tolerance requires the development of reproducible screening methods that simulate field conditions, and which provide quantitative data for statistical testing and selection of genotypes with differential responses. In addition, the study of molecular responses to drought and salt stress requires controlled conditions for growth and treatments that are reportable and comparable between different laboratories. Drought, also known as soil water deficit, can result from insufficient moisture for a plant to grow adequately and complete its life cycle. Salinity due to excess sodium chloride affects rice at seedling and flowering stages, reducing root and leaf growth. Both these abiotic stresses can lead to major physiological and biochemical changes such as reduced photosynthesis and reprogramming of gene expression. The methods presented in this chapter can be applied for (a) examination of stress responses in rice vegetative and reproductive tissues to identify and characterize molecular and physiological responses; (b) testing of candidate genes by overexpression or knockout studies evaluated for altered stress response phenotypes; and (c) screening of different genotypes such as accessions or segregating populations for their quantitative responses to abiotic stress parameters.
23469243	Reproductive organ and vascular specific promoter of the rice plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase mediates environmental stress responses in plants.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Plasma membrane Ca(2+)ATPase is a transport protein in the plasma membrane of cells and helps in removal of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the cell, hence regulating Ca(2+) level within cells. Though plant Ca(2+)ATPases have been shown to be involved in plant stress responses but their promoter regions have not been well studied.

RESULTS: The 1478 bp promoter sequence of rice plasma membrane Ca(2+)ATPase contains cis-acting elements responsive to stresses and plant hormones. To identify the functional region, serial deletions of the promoter were fused with the GUS sequence and four constructs were obtained. These were differentially activated under NaCl, PEG cold, methyl viologen, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate treatments. We demonstrated that the rice plasma membrane Ca(2+)ATPase promoter is responsible for vascular-specific and multiple stress-inducible gene expression. Only full-length promoter showed specific GUS expression under stress conditions in floral parts. High GUS activity was observed in roots with all the promoter constructs. The -1478 to -886 bp flanking region responded well upon treatment with salt and drought. Only the full-length promoter presented cold-induced GUS expression in leaves, while in shoots slight expression was observed for -1210 and -886 bp flanking region. The -1210 bp deletion significantly responded to exogenous methyl viologen and abscisic acid induction. The -1210 and -886 bp flanking region resulted in increased GUS activity in leaves under methyl jasmonate treatments, whereas in shoots the -886 bp and -519 bp deletion gave higher expression. Salicylic acid failed to induce GUS activities in leaves for all the constructs.

CONCLUSIONS: The rice plasma membrane Ca(2+)ATPase promoter is a reproductive organ-specific as well as vascular-specific. This promoter contains drought, salt, cold, methyl viologen, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate related cis-elements, which regulated gene expression. Overall, the tissue-specificity and inducible nature of this promoter could grant wide applicability in plant biotechnology.
23457591	Genomic insights into the glutathione S-transferase gene family of two rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) and Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes control crucial traits for the metabolism of various toxins encountered by insects in host plants and the wider environment, including insecticides. The planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera are serious specialist pests of rice throughout eastern Asia. Their capacity to rapidly adapt to resistant rice varieties and to develop resistance to various insecticides has led to severe outbreaks over the last decade.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the genome sequence of N. lugens, we identified for the first time the complete GST gene family of a delphacid insect whilst nine GST gene orthologs were identified from the closely related species S. furcifera. Nilaparvata lugens has 11 GST genes belonging to six cytosolic subclasses and a microsomal class, many fewer than seen in other insects with known genomes. Sigma is the largest GST subclass, and the intron-exon pattern deviates significantly from that of other species. Higher GST gene expression in the N. lugens adult migratory form reflects the higher risk of this life stage in encountering the toxins of non-host plants. After exposure to a sub-lethal dose of four insecticides, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, buprofezin or beta-cypermethrin, more GST genes were upregulated in S. furcifera than in N. lugens. RNA interference targeting two N. lugens GST genes, NlGSTe1 and NlGSTm2, significantly increased the sensitivity of fourth instar nymphs to chlorpyrifos but not to beta-cypermethrin.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides the first elucidation of the nature of the GST gene family in a delphacid species, offering new insights into the evolution of metabolic enzyme genes in insects. Further, the use of RNA interference to identify the GST genes induced by insecticides illustrates likely mechanisms for the tolerance of these insects.
23349140	Translational downregulation of RBCL is operative in the coordinated expression of Rubisco genes in senescent leaves in rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	Rubisco gene expression was examined in detail in rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves at different positions, i.e. expanding, mature, and senescent leaves. Rubisco small subunit (RBCS) synthesis and RBCS mRNA levels were maximal in expanding leaves and gradually became lower in mature and senescent leaves, with declines in those of the large subunit (RBCL) being relatively slower. The amount of synthesized RBCL per unit level of RBCL mRNA and polysome loading of RBCL mRNA declined in senescent leaves, whereas such phenomena were not observed for RBCS. These results suggested that gene expression of RBCL is downregulated at the level of its translation when a balance between RBCL and RBCS expression is disturbed by leaf senescence. It has been suggested that RBCS protein is a positive regulator for RBCL mRNA level in expanding rice leaves, as judged from their stoichiometric relationship in RBCS transgenic rice plants. However, the ratio of the RBCL mRNA level to the amount of synthesized RBCS in senescent leaves was significantly higher than that in expanding leaves. Therefore, it is suggested that the decline in RBCL mRNA level in senescent leaves is not fully accounted for by that in the amount of synthesized RBCS. Effects of other factors such as the stability of RBCL mRNA may come into play.
23637814	Evidence for biotrophic lifestyle and biocontrol potential of dark septate endophyte Harpophora oryzae to rice blast disease.	2013	PLoS One	The mutualism pattern of the dark septate endophyte (DSE) Harpophora oryzae in rice roots and its biocontrol potential in rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae were investigated. Fluorescent protein-expressing H. oryzae was used to monitor the colonization pattern. Hyphae invaded from the epidermis to the inner cortex, but not into the root stele. Fungal colonization increased with root tissue maturation, showing no colonization in the meristematic zone, slight colonization in the elongation zone, and heavy colonization in the differentiation zone. H. oryzae adopted a biotrophic lifestyle in roots accompanied by programmed cell death. Real-time PCR facilitated the accurate quantification of fungal growth and the respective plant response. The biocontrol potential of H. oryzae was visualized by inoculation with eGFP-tagged M. oryzae in rice. H. oryzae protected rice from M. oryzae root invasion by the accumulation of H2O2 and elevated antioxidative capacity. H. oryzae also induced systemic resistance against rice blast. This systemic resistance was mediated by the OsWRKY45-dependent salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, as indicated by the strongly upregulated expression of OsWRKY45. The colonization pattern of H. oryzae was consistent with the typical characteristics of DSEs. H. oryzae enhanced local resistance by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high antioxidative level and induced OsWRKY45-dependent SA-mediated systemic resistance against rice blast.
23244200	Comparative proteomics analysis of selenium responses in selenium-enriched rice grains.	2013	J Proteome Res	By foliar fortification with selenite, selenium (Se)-enriched rice with a higher Se content and grain yield has been generated. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Se response in rice grains remain unknown; therefore, we carried out a comparative proteomics study in Se-enriched rice grains by using two approaches including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-coupled MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and 1-DE/LC-FTICR-MS-coupled label-free quantification. By comparison between Se treatment and control, 62 and 250 abundance changed proteins were identified from 2-DE and 1-DE, respectively. By functional classification, proteins involved in metabolism, cell redox regulation, and seed nutritional storage were the most highly affected by Se accumulation. The up-regulation of late embryogenesis abundant proteins as well as proteins involved in sucrose synthesis and other metabolism pathways may contribute to the earlier maturation and higher yield of the Se-enriched rice. In addition, there have been six proteins identified to contain selenoamino acid modification, which is the first identification of selenoproteins in higher plants. In conclusion, our study provided novel insights into Se response in rice grains at the proteome level, which are expected to be highly useful for dissecting the Se response pathways in rice and for the production of Se-enriched rice in the future.
23315878	RNA interference-mediated silencing of the starch branching enzyme gene improves amylose content in rice.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Amylose and amylopectin are the 2 major components of plant storage starch. The rice starch branching enzyme (RBE) plays an important role in the starch components of rice. In the present study, we selected a specific 195-bp segment from the RBE3 gene to construct hairpin DNA, which was driven by an endosperm-specific high molecular weight glutenin promoter to regulate the biosynthesis of starch. An RNA interference plasmid for the RBE3 gene was constructed to form double-stranded RNA. Following Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation (in the cultivar Zhonghua 11), 41 transgenic plants were identified using PCR and Southern blot analysis. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR revealed that RBE3 gene expression was significantly reduced in immature transgenic seeds. Transgenic rice amylose content had an average increase of 140%. The highest rice amylose content was 47.61% and the growth rate increased 238% compared to the non-transgenic controls. Branching enzyme II activity was notably reduced, and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, soluble starch synthase, isoamylase, and pullulanase enzyme activity was markedly reduced in T3 seeds. Relative enzyme activity change explained the reduction in thousand-grain weight in transgenic plants. The present study indicated that amylose content was negatively correlated with branching enzyme II activity, spike size, and thousand-grain weight.
23385589	EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice.	2013	Nat Commun	Programmed cell death is essential for the development of multicellular organisms, yet pathways of plant programmed cell death and its regulation remain elusive. Here we report that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor conserved in land plants, positively regulates programmed cell death in tapetal cells in rice anthers. eat1 exhibits delayed tapetal cell death and aborted pollen formation. ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants. Expression and genetic analyses revealed that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 acts downstream of TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION, another positive regulator of tapetal programmed cell death, and that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 can also interact with the TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION protein. This study demonstrates that ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 promotes aspartic proteases triggering plant programmed cell death, and reveals a dynamic regulatory cascade in male reproductive development in rice.
23333965	Differences and similarities in the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism between rice and dicots.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	In rice seedlings, elongation of leaf sheaths is suppressed by light stimuli. The response is mediated by two classes of photoreceptors, phytochromes and cryptochromes. However, it remains unclear how these photoreceptors interact in the process. Our recent study using phytochrome mutants and novel cryptochrome RNAi lines revealed that cryptochromes and phytochromes function cooperatively, but independently to reduce active GA contents in seedlings in visible light. Blue light captured by cryptochrome 1 (cry1a and cry1b) induces robust expression of GA 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-7). In parallel, phytochrome B with auxiliary action of phytochrome A mediates repression of GA 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4). The independent effects cumulatively reduce active GA contents, leading to a suppression of leaf sheath elongation. These regulatory mechanisms are distinct from phytochrome B function in dicots. We discuss reasons why the distinct system appeared in rice, and advantages of the rice system in early photomorphogenesis.
23322345	Mitochondrial DNA genetic polymorphism in thirteen rice cytoplasmic male sterile lines.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Thirteen rice CMS lines derived from different cytoplasms were classified into eight groups by PCR amplification on mtDNA. The orf79 gene, which causes Boro II CMS, possibly results in Dian1-CMS. Thirteen rice cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines derived from different cytoplasms are widely used for hybrid rice breeding. Based on 27 loci on mitochondrial DNA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and segmental sequence variations between typical indica and japonica as well as high-polymorphism segmental sequence variations and single nucleotide polymorphisms among rice CMS lines, the 13 rice CMS lines were classified into eight groups: (I) wild-abortive CMS, Indonesian Shuitiangu CMS, K-CMS, Gang CMS, D-CMS and dwarf abortive CMS; (II) Maxie-CMS; (III) Honglian CMS; (IV) Boro II CMS; (V) Dian1-CMS; (VI) Liao-CMS; (VII) Lead CMS; and (VIII) Chinese wild rice CMS. According to their pollen abortion phenotypes, groups I and II (including 7 CMS lines) were classified as sporophytic CMS lines, the cytoplasmic genetic relationships among which were very close. They could have originated from similar, or even the same, cytoplasm donors. Groups III-VIII (including 6 CMS lines) were categorized as gametophytic CMS lines, the cytoplasms of which differed from one another, with some having relatively far genetic relationships. Dian1-CMS was found to harbor the orf79 gene, which causes Boro II CMS, whereas Liao-CMS had an orf79 structure that does not result in Lead CMS. Therefore, we speculated that orf79 is associated with Dian1-CMS but not with Liao-CMS. The atp6-orf79 structure related to sterility was also found to experience multiple evolutionary turnovers. All sporophytic CMS lines were indica-like. Except the Honglian CMS line, which was indica-like, all gametophytic CMS lines were japonica-like.
23577102	Dissecting rice polyamine metabolism under controlled long-term drought stress.	2013	PLoS One	A selection of 21 rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica) was characterized under moderate long-term drought stress by comprehensive physiological analyses and determination of the contents of polyamines and selected metabolites directly related to polyamine metabolism. To investigate the potential regulation of polyamine biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, the expression of 21 genes encoding enzymes involved in these pathways were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Analysis of the genomic loci revealed that 11 of these genes were located in drought-related QTL regions, in agreement with a proposed role of polyamine metabolism in rice drought tolerance. The cultivars differed widely in their drought tolerance and parameters such as biomass and photosynthetic quantum yield were significantly affected by drought treatment. Under optimal irrigation free putrescine was the predominant polyamine followed by free spermidine and spermine. When exposed to drought putrescine levels decreased markedly and spermine became predominant in all cultivars. There were no correlations between polyamine contents and drought tolerance. GC-MS analysis revealed drought-induced changes of the levels of ornithine/arginine (substrate), substrates of polyamine synthesis, proline, product of a competing pathway and GABA, a potential degradation product. Gene expression analysis indicated that ADC-dependent polyamine biosynthesis responded much more strongly to drought than the ODC-dependent pathway. Nevertheless the fold change in transcript abundance of ODC1 under drought stress was linearly correlated with the drought tolerance of the cultivars. Combining metabolite and gene expression data, we propose a model of the coordinate adjustment of polyamine biosynthesis for the accumulation of spermine under drought conditions.
23638363	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice.	2013	PeerJ	Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiration, catalyzing the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. Arabidopsis GLO is required for nonhost defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae and for tobacco Pto/AvrPto-mediated defense responses. We previously described identification of rice GLO1 that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors. TGA transcription factors are well known to participate in NPR1/NH1-mediated defense signaling, which is crucial to systemic acquired resistance in plants. Here we demonstrate that reduction of rice GLO1 expression leads to enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports. Inducible silencing of GLO1, employing a dexamethasone-GVG (Gal4 DNA binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion) inducible system, alleviates these detrimental effects. Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.
23555750	Functional analysis and expressional characterization of rice ankyrin repeat-containing protein, OsPIANK1, in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae attack.	2013	PLoS One	The ankyrin repeat-containing protein gene OsPIANK1 (AK068021) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was previously shown to be upregulated following infection with the rice leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). In this study, we further characterized the role of OsPIANK1 in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae (M.oryzae) by 5' deletion analysis of its promoter and overexpression of the gene. The promoter of OsPIANK1 with 1,985 bps in length was sufficient to induce the OsPIANK1 response to inoculation with M.oryzae and to exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA), but not to exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA). A TCA-element present in the region between -563 bp and -249 bp may be responsible for the OsPIANK1 response to both M.oryzae infection and exogenous SA application. The JERE box, CGTCA-box, and two MYB binding sites locating in the region between -1985 bp and -907 bp may be responsible for the response of OsPIANK1 to exogenous MeJA. OsPIANK1 expression was upregulated after inoculation with M.oryzae and after treatment with exogenous SA and MeJA. Overexpression of OsPIANK1 enhanced resistance of rice to M.oryzae, although it did not confer complete resistance. The enhanced resistance to M.oryzae was accompanied by enhanced transcriptional expression of SA- and JA-dependent genes such as NH1, WKRY13, PAL, AOS2, PR1b, and PR5. This evidence suggests that OsPIANK1 acted as a positive regulator in rice basal defense mediated by SA- and JA-signaling pathways.
23319637	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) control many aspects of growth and development in plants. GA(1) has been the most frequently found bioactive GA in various tissues of flowering plants, but the enzymes responsible for GA(1) biosynthesis have not been fully elucidated due to the enzymes catalyzing the 13-hydroxylation step not being identified. Because of the lack of mutants defective in this enzyme, biological significance of GA 13-hydroxylation has been unknown. Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism. There was a trend that the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were increased in these transgenic plants. Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro. Moreover, the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were decreased, whereas those of 13-H GAs including GA(4) (which is more active than GA(1)) were increased, in the rice cyp714b1 cyp714b2 double mutant. These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice. The double mutant plants appear phenotypically normal until heading, but show elongated uppermost internode at the heading stage. Moreover, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 expression was up-regulated by exogenous application of bioactive GAs. Our results suggest that GA 13-oxidases play a role in fine-tuning plant growth by decreasing GA bioactivity in rice and that they also participate in GA homeostasis.
23415326	A rice stress-responsive NAC gene enhances tolerance of transgenic wheat to drought and salt stresses.	2013	Plant Sci	Drought and salinity are the primary factors limiting wheat production worldwide. It has been shown that a rice stress-responsive transcription factor encoded by the rice NAC1 gene (SNAC1) plays an important role in drought stress tolerance. Therefore, we introduced the SNAC1 gene under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter into an elite Chinese wheat variety Yangmai12. Plants expressing SNAC1 displayed significantly enhanced tolerance to drought and salinity in multiple generations, and contained higher levels of water and chlorophyll in their leaves, as compared to wild type. In addition, the fresh and dry weights of the roots of these plants were also increased, and the plants had increased sensitivities to abscisic acid (ABA), which inhibited root and shoot growth. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions revealed that the expressions of genes involved in abiotic stress/ABA signaling, such as wheat 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-5-kinase, sucrose phosphate synthase, type 2C protein phosphatases and regulatory components of ABA receptor, were effectively regulated by the alien SNAC1 gene. These results indicated high and functional expression of the rice SNAC1 gene in wheat. And our study provided a promising approach to improve the tolerances of wheat cultivars to drought and salinity through genetic engineering.
23291755	Evaluation of extraction solutions for biochemical analyses of the proteins in rice grains.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The influence of different extraction solutions on the proteins extracted from rice grains was investigated. The largest amounts of salt-soluble proteins were extracted with solutions supplemented with Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Rice allergens were analyzed by multiplex immunodetection. Except for α-globulin extracted with the solutions at pH 8.0, which showed a low-molecular-weight band besides the main band, no significant solution-dependent difference among the allergens was found. Total proteins were extracted with four kinds of solution. The extraction of the basic subunit of glutelin was found to be SDS-dependent, and more protein was obtained with extraction solutions supplemented with SDS. The contents of α-globulin and α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors were higher in the extracts without SDS than with SDS. We conclude from the present data that, in order to obtain comparable data from rice grain salt-soluble and total protein analyses, differences in the protein extraction efficiency of solutions used should be taken into consideration.
23403394	The rice mitochondria proteome and its response during development and to the environment.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is both a major crop species and the key model grass for molecular and physiological research. Mitochondria are important in rice, as in all crops, as the main source of ATP for cell maintenance and growth. However, the practical significance of understanding the function of mitochondria in rice is increased by the widespread farming practice of using hybrids to boost rice production. This relies on cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines with abortive pollen caused by dysfunctional mitochondria. We provide an overview of what is known about the mitochondrial proteome of rice seedlings. To date, more than 320 proteins have been identified in purified rice mitochondria using mass spectrometry. The insights from this work include a broad understanding of the major subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and TCA cycle enzymes, carbon and nitrogen metabolism enzymes as well as details of the supporting machinery for biogenesis and the subset of stress-responsive mitochondrial proteins. Many proteins with unknown functions have also been found in rice mitochondria. Proteomic analysis has also revealed the features of rice mitochondrial protein presequences required for mitochondrial targeting, as well as cleavage site features for processing of precursors after import. Changes in the abundance of rice mitochondrial proteins in response to different stresses, especially anoxia and light, are summarized. Future research on quantitative analysis of the rice mitochondrial proteomes at the spatial and developmental level, its response to environmental stresses and recent advances in understanding of the basis of rice CMS systems are highlighted.
23308094	Global identification of multiple OsGH9 family members and their involvement in cellulose crystallinity modification in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Plant glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) comprises typical endo-β-1,4-glucanase (EGases, EC3.2.1.4). Although GH9A (KORRIGAN) family genes have been reported to be involved in cellulose biosynthesis in plants, much remains unknown about other GH9 subclasses. In this study, we observed a global gene co-expression profiling and conducted a correlation analysis between OsGH9 and OsCESA among 66 tissues covering most periods of life cycles in 2 rice varieties. Our results showed that OsGH9A3 and B5 possessed an extremely high co-expression with OsCESA1, 3, and 8 typical for cellulose biosynthesis in rice. Using two distinct rice non-GH9 mutants and wild type, we performed integrative analysis of gene expression level by qRT-PCR, cellulase activities in situ and in vitro, and lignocellulose crystallinity index (CrI) in four internodes of stem tissues. For the first time, OsGH9B1, 3, and 16 were characterized with the potential role in lignocellulose crystallinity alteration in rice, whereas OsGH9A3 and B5 were suggested for cellulose biosynthesis. In addition, phylogenetic analysis and gene co-expression comparison revealed GH9 function similarity in Arabidopsis and rice. Hence, the data can provide insights into GH9 function in plants and offer the potential strategy for genetic manipulation of plant cell wall using the five aforementioned novel OsGH9 genes.
23526955	Fine mapping of wheat stripe rust resistance gene Yr26 based on collinearity of wheat with Brachypodium distachyon and rice.	2013	PLoS One	The Yr26 gene, conferring resistance to all currently important races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) in China, was previously mapped to wheat chromosome deletion bin C-1BL-6-0.32 with low-density markers. In this study, collinearity of wheat to Brachypodium distachyon and rice was used to develop markers to saturate the chromosomal region containing the Yr26 locus, and a total of 2,341 F2 plants and 551 F2∶3 progenies derived from Avocet S×92R137 were used to develop a fine map of Yr26. Wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in deletion bin C-1BL-6-0.32 were used to develop sequence tagged site (STS) markers. The EST-STS markers flanking Yr26 were used to identify collinear regions of the rice and B. distachyon genomes. Wheat ESTs with significant similarities in the two collinear regions were selected to develop conserved markers for fine mapping of Yr26. Thirty-one markers were mapped to the Yr26 region, and six of them cosegregated with the resistance gene. Marker orders were highly conserved between rice and B. distachyon, but some rearrangements were observed between rice and wheat. Two flanking markers (CON-4 and CON-12) further narrowed the genomic region containing Yr26 to a 1.92 Mb region in B. distachyon chromosome 3 and a 1.17 Mb region in rice chromosome 10, and two putative resistance gene analogs were identified in the collinear region of B. distachyon. The markers developed in this study provide a potential target site for further map-based cloning of Yr26 and should be useful in marker assisted selection for pyramiding the gene with other resistance genes.
23292878	Recent advances in dissecting stress-regulatory crosstalk in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	Biotic and abiotic stresses impose a serious limitation on crop productivity worldwide. Prior or simultaneous exposure to one type of stress often affects the plant response to other stresses, indicating extensive overlap and crosstalk between stress-response signaling pathways. Systems biology approaches that integrate large genomic and proteomic data sets have facilitated identification of candidate genes that govern this stress-regulatory crosstalk. Recently, we constructed a yeast two-hybrid map around three rice proteins that control the response to biotic and abiotic stresses, namely the immune receptor XA21, which confers resistance to the Gram-negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; NH1, the rice ortholog of NPR1, a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance; and the ethylene-responsive transcription factor, SUB1A, which confers tolerance to submergence stress. These studies coupled with transcriptional profiling and co-expression analyses identified a suite of proteins that are positioned at the interface of biotic and abiotic stress responses, including mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (OsMPK5), wall-associated kinase 25 (WAK25), sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 (SnRK1), SUB1A binding protein 23 (SAB23), and several WRKY family transcription factors. Emerging evidence suggests that these genes orchestrate crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stresses through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of cellular energy homeostasis and modification of synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions between the stress hormones salicylic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid.
23299421	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Plant innate immunity relies on successful detection of trespassing pathogens through recognizing their microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the cell surface. We recently reported two rice lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin. Here we further demonstrated the important roles of OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice defense signaling, as silencing of either LYP impaired the defense marker gene activation induced by either bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaecola or fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice.
23220939	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis.	2013	Mol Plant	MSH5, a meiosis-specific member of the MutS-homolog family, is required for normal level of recombination in budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis. Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility. The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype. OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I. OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10. However, those ZMM proteins cannot be localized normally in the absence of OsMSH5. Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5. Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation.
23536906	Tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling of Sorghum propinquum using a rice genome array.	2013	PLoS One	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is one of the world's most important cereal crops. S. propinquum is a perennial wild relative of S. bicolor with well-developed rhizomes. Functional genomics analysis of S. propinquum, especially with respect to molecular mechanisms related to rhizome growth and development, can contribute to the development of more sustainable grain, forage, and bioenergy cropping systems. In this study, we used a whole rice genome oligonucleotide microarray to obtain tissue-specific gene expression profiles of S. propinquum with special emphasis on rhizome development. A total of 548 tissue-enriched genes were detected, including 31 and 114 unique genes that were expressed predominantly in the rhizome tips (RT) and internodes (RI), respectively. Further GO analysis indicated that the functions of these tissue-enriched genes corresponded to their characteristic biological processes. A few distinct cis-elements, including ABA-responsive RY repeat CATGCA, sugar-repressive TTATCC, and GA-responsive TAACAA, were found to be prevalent in RT-enriched genes, implying an important role in rhizome growth and development. Comprehensive comparative analysis of these rhizome-enriched genes and rhizome-specific genes previously identified in Oryza longistaminata and S. propinquum indicated that phytohormones, including ABA, GA, and SA, are key regulators of gene expression during rhizome development. Co-localization of rhizome-enriched genes with rhizome-related QTLs in rice and sorghum generated functional candidates for future cloning of genes associated with rhizome growth and development.
23613915	Analysis of cytoplasmic effects and fine-mapping of a genic male sterile line in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Cytoplasm has substantial genetic effects on progeny and is important for yield improvement in rice breeding. Studies on the cytoplasmic effects of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) show that most types of CMS have negative effects on yield-related traits and that these negative effects vary among CMS. Some types of genic male sterility (GMS), including photo-thermo sensitive male sterility (PTMS), have been widely used in rice breeding, but the cytoplasmic effects of GMS remain unknown. Here, we identified a GMS mutant line, h2s, which exhibited small, white anthers and failed to produce mature pollen. Unlike CMS, the h2s had significant positive cytoplasmic effects on the seed set rate, weight per panicle, yield, and general combining ability (GCA) for plant height, seed set rate, weight per panicle, and yield. These effects indicated that h2s cytoplasm may show promise for the improvement of rice yield. Genetic analysis suggested that the phenotype of h2s was controlled by a single recessive locus. We mapped h2s to a 152 kb region on chromosome 6, where 22 candidate genes were predicted. None of the 22 genes had previously been reported to be responsible for the phenotypes of h2s. Sequencing analysis showed a 12 bp deletion in the sixth exon of Loc_Os06g40550 in h2s in comparison to wild type, suggesting that Loc_Os06g40550 is the best candidate gene. These results lay a strong foundation for cloning of the H2S gene to elucidate the molecular mechanism of male reproduction.
23383126	Both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 are required for the production of small RNA in response to DNA-damage in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways play important roles in the regulation of development, genome stability and various stress responses in many eukaryotes. Recently, a new type of small interfering RNAs (qiRNAs) approximately 20-21 nucleotides long in Neurospora crassa have been shown to mediate gene silencing in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. However, the mechanism for RNA silencing in the DDR pathway is largely unknown in plants. Here, we report that a class of small RNAs (qiRNAs) derived from rDNA was markedly induced after treatment by DNA-damaging agents [ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS and UV-C)], and that aberrant RNAs (aRNAs) as precursors were also highly induced after the DNA damage treatment in rice. However, these RNAs were completely abolished in OsRecQ1 (RecQ DNA helicase homologue) and OsRDR1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue) mutant lines where either gene was disrupted by the insertion of rice retrotransposon Tos17 after the same treatment. DNA damage resulted in a more significant increase in cell death and a more severe inhibition of root growth in both mutant lines than in the WT. Together, these results strongly suggest that both OsRecQ1 and OsRDR1 play a pivotal role in the aRNA and qiRNA biogenesis required for the DDR and repair pathway in rice, and it may be a novel mechanism of regulation to the DDR through the production of qiRNA in plants.
22927237	Marker-free, tissue-specific expression of Cry1Ab as a safe transgenic strategy for insect resistance in rice plants.	2013	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Rice is the major food resource for nearly half of the global population; however, insect infestation could severely affect the production of this staple food. To improve rice insect resistance and reduce the levels of Bt toxin released into the environment, the Cry1Ab gene was conjugated to the rice rbcS promoter to express Bt toxin in specific tissues of transgenic plants.

RESULTS: Eight marker-free, T(2) lines were separated from the T(0) cotransformants. Using RT-PCR, high levels of Cry1Ab expression were detected in the leaf but not in the seed. The Cry1Ab protein level ranged from 1.66 to 3.31 µg g(-1) in the leaves of four transgenic lines, but was barely detectable in their seeds by ELISA. Bioassays showed that the mortality rate of silkworm larvae feeding on mulberry leaves dipped in transgenic rice flour and pollen was less than that of the positive control (KMD), and that their average weight was higher than that of KMD, suggesting that the Cry1Ab protein was not expressed in the seed and pollen.

CONCLUSION: The transgene conferred a high level of resistance to insects and biosafety to the rice plants, which could be directly used in rice breeding.
23386349	Capillary electrophoresis of seed storage proteins: the separation and identification of microheterogeneous rice glutelin subunits.	2013	Methods Mol Biol	Glutelin, the major seed storage protein of rice (Oryza sativa L.), consists of multiple polymeric and monomeric subunits. Each subunit is composed of an α and a β polypeptide that are covalently linked by a disulfide bond. To analyze the microheterogeneous glutelin subunits using capillary electrophoresis (CE), the author identified the appropriate sample preparation procedures as well as optimal CE conditions. The glutelin was dissociated into its component α and β polypeptides by denaturation and reduction with low urea and 2-mercaptoethanol for a long incubation time at room temperature. The molecular species of the completely dissociated α and β polypeptides were identified and quantitatively analyzed by CE and SDS-PAGE using glutelin mutants. The measured CE migration times of the polypeptides correlated well with the calculated charge-to-size parameter values. Therefore, the rapid, simple, and precise separation and quantification of microheterogeneous proteins by CE required not only optimal CE conditions but also adequate protein pretreatment based on the molecular nature of the protein tested.
23349143	The mesophyll anatomy enhancing CO2 diffusion is a key trait for improving rice photosynthesis.	2013	J Exp Bot	Increases in rates of individual leaf photosynthesis (P(n)) are critical for future increases in yields of rice plants. Although many efforts have been made to improve rice P(n) with transgenic technology, the desired increases in P(n) have not yet been achieved. Two rice lines with extremely high values of P(n) were identified among the backcrossed inbred lines derived from the indica variety Takanari, one of the most productive varieties in Japan, and the elite japonica variety Koshihikari (Koshihikari/Takanari//Takanari). The P(n) values of the two lines at an ambient CO(2) concentration of 370μmol mol(-1) as well as at a saturating concentration of CO(2) were 20-50% higher than those of the parental varieties. Compared with Takanari, these lines had neither a higher content nor a higher activity of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase when the leaf nitrogen contents were similar, but they did have high mesophyll conductance with respect to CO(2) flux due to their higher density and more highly developed lobes of mesophyll cells. These lines also had higher electron transport rates. The plant growth rates of these lines were higher than that of Takanari. The findings show that it is possible to increase P(n) significantly, both at the current atmospheric concentration of CO(2) and at the increased concentration of CO(2) expected in the future, using appropriate combinations of genetic resources that are available at present.
23371950	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	The shoot apical meristem is the ultimate source of the cells that constitute the entire aboveground portion of the plant body. In Arabidopsis thaliana, meristem maintenance is regulated by the negative feedback loop of WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV). Although CLV-like genes, such as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, have been shown to be involved in maintenance of the reproductive meristems in rice (Oryza sativa), current understanding of meristem maintenance remains insufficient. In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase. In addition, we found that WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) promotes the undifferentiated state of the meristem in rice and that WOX4 function is associated with cytokinin action. Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2). Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
23292790	Constitutive expression of a miR319 gene alters plant development and enhances salt and drought tolerance in transgenic creeping bentgrass.	2013	Plant Physiol	MicroRNA319 (miR319) is one of the first characterized and conserved microRNA families in plants and has been demonstrated to target TCP (for TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS [PCF]) genes encoding plant-specific transcription factors. MiR319 expression is regulated by environmental stimuli, suggesting its involvement in plant stress response, although experimental evidence is lacking and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study investigates the role that miR319 plays in the plant response to abiotic stress using transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing a rice (Oryza sativa) miR319 gene, Osa-miR319a. We found that transgenic plants overexpressing Osa-miR319a displayed morphological changes and exhibited enhanced drought and salt tolerance associated with increased leaf wax content and water retention but reduced sodium uptake. Gene expression analysis indicated that at least four putative miR319 target genes, AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14, and a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60 were down-regulated in transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate that miR319 controls plant responses to drought and salinity stress. The enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants is related to significant down-regulation of miR319 target genes, implying their potential for use in the development of novel molecular strategies to genetically engineer crop species for enhanced resistance to environmental stress.
23344857	OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : Silencing OsMPK3 decreased elicited JA levels, which subsequently reduced levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs) and improved the performance of SSB larvae, but did not influence BPH. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) are known to play an important role in plant defense by transferring biotic and abiotic signals into programmed cellular responses. However, their functions in the herbivore-induced defense response in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a MPK3 gene from rice, OsMPK3, and found that its expression levels were up-regulated in response to infestation by the larvae of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis), to mechanical wounding and to treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), but not to infestation by the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens or to treatment with salicylic acid. Moreover, mechanical wounding and SSB infestation induced the expression of OsMPK3 strongly and quickly, whereas JA treatment induced the gene more weakly and slowly. Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1. The reduced JA signaling in ir-mpk3 plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs) and improved the performance of SSB larvae, but did not influence BPH. Our findings suggest that the gene OsMPK3 responds early in herbivore-induced defense and can be regulated by rice plants to activate a specific and appropriate defense response to different herbivores.
23319643	Control of transposon activity by a histone H3K4 demethylase in rice.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitously present in plant genomes and often account for significant fractions of the nuclear DNA. For example, roughly 40% of the rice genome consists of TEs, many of which are retrotransposons, including 14% LTR- and ∼1% non-LTR retrotransposons. Despite their wide distribution and abundance, very few TEs have been found to be transpositional, indicating that TE activities may be tightly controlled by the host genome to minimize the potentially mutagenic effects associated with active transposition. Consistent with this notion, a growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic silencing pathways such as DNA methylation, RNA interference, and H3K9me2 function collectively to repress TE activity at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It is not yet clear, however, whether the removal of histone modifications associated with active transcription is also involved in TE silencing. Here, we show that the rice protein JMJ703 is an active H3K4-specific demethylase required for TEs silencing. Impaired JMJ703 activity led to elevated levels of H3K4me3, the misregulation of numerous endogenous genes, and the transpositional reactivation of two families of non-LTR retrotransposons. Interestingly, loss of JMJ703 did not affect TEs (such as Tos17) previously found to be silenced by other epigenetic pathways. These results indicate that the removal of active histone modifications is involved in TE silencing and that different subsets of TEs may be regulated by distinct epigenetic pathways.
23329372	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Germination followed by seedling growth constitutes two essential steps in the initiation of a new life cycle in plants, and in cereals, completion of these steps is regulated by sugar starvation and the hormone gibberellin. A calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 gene (OsCDPK1) was identified by differential screening of a cDNA library derived from sucrose-starved rice suspension cells. The expression of OsCDPK1 was found to be specifically activated by sucrose starvation among several stress conditions tested as well as activated transiently during post-germination seedling growth. In gain- and loss-of-function studies performed with transgenic rice overexpressing a constitutively active or RNA interference gene knockdown construct, respectively, OsCDPK1 was found to negatively regulate the expression of enzymes essential for GA biosynthesis. In contrast, OsCDPK1 activated the expression of a 14-3-3 protein, GF14c. Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings. Hence, our studies demonstrated that OsCDPK1 transduces the post-germination Ca(2+) signal derived from sugar starvation and GA, refines the endogenous GA concentration and prevents drought stress injury, all essential functions to seedling development at the beginning of the life cycle in rice.
23299424	P5-type sulfhydryl oxidoreductase promotes the sorting of proteins to protein body I in rice endosperm cells.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	In rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm cells, oxidative protein folding is necessary for the sorting of storage proteins to protein bodies, PB-I and PB-II. Here we examined the role of sulfhydryl oxidoreductase PDIL2;3 (a human P5 ortholog) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), using GFP-AB, a PB-I marker in which the N-terminal region (AB) of α-globulin is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). RNAi knockdown of PDIL2;3 inhibited the accumulation of GFP-AB in PB-I and promoted its exit from the ER. We discuss the role of PDIL2;3 in retaining proteins within the ER and specifying their localization to PB-I through disulfide bond formation.
23356873	Differential induction of mitochondrial machinery by light intensity correlates with changes in respiratory metabolism and photorespiration in rice leaves.	2013	New Phytol	The light responsiveness of mitochondrial function was investigated through changes in mitochondrial composition and metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa) shoots. The mitochondrial proteome and metabolite abundances under low light, (LL, 100 μmol m(-2) s(-1) ), and high light (HL, 700 μmol m(-2) s(-1) ) were measured along with information on shoot photosynthetic, respiratory and photorespiratory activity. Specific steps in mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism were decreased under HL, correlating with lower respiration rate under HL. The abundance of mitochondrial enzymes in branch chain metabolism was reduced under HL/LL, and correlated with a decrease in the abundance of a range of amino acids in the HL/LL. Mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase was increased under LL/HL treatments. Significant accumulation of glycine decarboxylase P, T subunits and serine hydroxymethyltransferase occurred in response to light. The abundance of the glycine decarboxylase (GDC) H subunit proteins was not changed by HL/LL treatments, and the abundance of GDC L subunit protein was halved under HL, indicating a change in the stoichiometry of GDC subunits, while photorespiration was fourfold higher in LL- than in HL-treated plants. Insights into these light-dependent phenomena and their importance for understanding the initiation of photorespiration in rice and adaptation of mitochondria to function in photosynthetic cells are discussed.
23320078	Oryza sativa COI homologues restore jasmonate signal transduction in Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutants.	2013	PLoS One	CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component that interacts with JAZ proteins and targets them for degradation in response to JA signaling. The Arabidopsis genome has a single copy of COI1, but the Oryza sativa genome has three closely related COI homologs. To examine the functions of the three OsCOIs, we used yeast two-hybrid assays to examine their interactions with JAZ proteins and found that OsCOIs interacted with OsJAZs and with JAZs, in a coronatine dependent manner. We also tested whether OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b could complement Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutants and found that overexpression of either gene in the coi1-1 mutant resulted in restoration of JA signal transduction and production of seeds, indicating successful complementation. Although OsCOI2 interacted with a few OsJAZs, we were not able to successfully complement the coi1-1 mutant with OsCOI2. Molecular modeling revealed that the three OsCOIs adopt 3D structures similar to COI1. Structural differences resulting from amino acid variations, especially among amino acid residues involved in the interaction with coronatine and JAZ proteins, were tested by mutation analysis. When His-391 in OsCOI2 was substituted with Tyr-391, OsCOI2 interacted with a wider range of JAZ proteins, including OsJAZ1, 2, 5∼9 and 11, and complemented coi1-1 mutants at a higher frequency than the other OsCOIs and COI1. These results indicate that the three OsCOIs are orthologues of COI1 and play key roles in JA signaling.
23303719	Identification of centromeric and telomeric DNA-binding proteins in rice.	2013	Proteomics	Centromeres and telomeres are DNA/protein complexes and essential functional components of eukaryotic chromosomes. Previous studies have shown that rice centromeres and telomeres are occupied by CentO (rice centromere satellite DNA) satellite and G-rich telomere repeats, respectively. However, the protein components are not fully understood. DNA-binding proteins associated with centromeric or telomeric DNAs will most likely be important for the understanding of centromere and telomere structure and functions. To capture DNA-specific binding proteins, affinity pull-down technique was applied in this study to isolate rice centromeric and telomeric DNA-binding proteins. Fifty-five proteins were identified for their binding affinity to rice CentO repeat, and 80 proteins were identified for their binding to telomere repeat. One CentO-binding protein, Os02g0288200, was demonstrated to bind to CentO specifically by in vitro assay. A conserved domain, DUF573 with unknown functions was identified in this protein, and proven to be responsible for the specific binding to CentO in vitro. Four proteins identified as telomere DNA-binding proteins in this study were reported by different groups previously. These results demonstrate that DNA affinity pull-down technique is effective in the isolation of sequence-specific binding proteins and will be applicable in future studies of centromere and telomere proteins.
23544090	Transcriptional profiling of rice early response to Magnaporthe oryzae identified OsWRKYs as important regulators in rice blast resistance.	2013	PLoS One	Rice blast disease is a major threat to rice production worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying rice resistance to the causal agent Magnaporthe oryzae remain elusive. Therefore, we carried out a transcriptome study on rice early defense response to M. oryzae. We found that the transcriptional profiles of rice compatible and incompatible interactions with M. oryzae were mostly similar, with genes regulated more prominently in the incompatible interactions. The functional analysis showed that the genes involved in signaling and secondary metabolism were extensively up-regulated. In particular, WRKY transcription factor genes were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes. Overexpressing one of these WRKY genes, OsWRKY47, in transgenic rice plants conferred enhanced resistance against rice blast fungus. Our results revealed the sophisticated transcriptional reprogramming of signaling and metabolic pathways during rice early response to M. oryzae and demonstrated the critical roles of WRKY transcription factors in rice blast resistance.
23463009	The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14.	2013	Nat Commun	Rice tillering is a multigenic trait that influences grain yield, but its regulation molecular module is poorly understood. Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice. An activation-tagged mutant osmads57-1 and OsMADS57-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers. OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering. Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on D14. D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57-1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines. OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression. Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription. Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering. This regulation mechanism could have important application in rice molecular breeding programs focused on high grain yield.
23324168	Functional diversification of FD transcription factors in rice, components of florigen activation complexes.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Florigen, a protein encoded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and Heading date 3a (Hd3a) in rice, is the universal flowering hormone in plants. Florigen is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem and initiates floral evocation. In shoot apical cells, conserved cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins act as florigen receptors. A hexameric florigen activation complex (FAC) composed of Hd3a, 14-3-3 proteins, and OsFD1, a transcription factor, activates OsMADS15, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis APETALA1, leading to flowering. Because FD is a key component of the FAC, we characterized the FD gene family and their functions. Phylogenetic analysis of FD genes indicated that this family is divided into two groups: (i) canonical FD genes that are conserved among eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots; and (ii) Poaceae-specific FD genes that are organized into three subgroups: Poaceae FD1, FD2 and FD3. The Poaceae FD1 group shares a small sequence motif, T(A/V)LSLNS, with FDs of eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots. Overexpression of OsFD2, a member of the Poaceae FD2 group, produced smaller leaves with shorter plastochrons, suggesting that OsFD2 controls leaf development. In vivo subcellular localization of Hd3a, 14-3-3 and OsFD2 suggested that in contrast to OsFD1, OsFD2 is restricted to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins, and interaction of Hd3a with 14-3-3 facilitates nuclear translocation of the FAC containing OsFD2. These results suggest that FD function has diverged between OsFD1 and OsFD2, but formation of a FAC is essential for their function.
23351381	Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice.	2013	BMB Rep	Heat shock proteins play an important role in plant stress tolerance and are mainly regulated by heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs). In this study, we generated transgenic rice over-expressing OsHsfA7 and carried out morphological observation and stress tolerance assays. Transgenic plants exhibited less, shorter lateral roots and root hair. Under salt treatment, over-expressing OsHsfA7 rice showed alleviative appearance of damage symptoms and higher survival rate, leaf electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content of transgenic plants were lower than those of wild type plants. Meanwhile, transgenic rice seedlings restored normal growth but wild type plants could not be rescued after drought and re-watering treatment. These findings indicate that over-expression of OsHsfA7 gene can increase tolerance to salt and drought stresses in rice seedlings.
23453017	Comparative analysis of microRNA promoters in Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics	Endogenously-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In plants, miRNAs have increasingly been identified by experiments based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, promoter organization is currently unknown for most plant miRNAs, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. This deficiency prevents a comprehensive understanding of miRNA-mediated gene networks. In this study, by analyzing full-length cDNA sequences related to miRNAs, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) for 62 and 55 miRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. The average free energy (AFE) profiles in the vicinity of TSSs were studied for both species. By employing position weight matrices (PWM) for 99 plant cis-elements, we discovered that three cis-elements were over-represented in the miRNA promoters of both species, while four and ten cis-elements were over-represented in Arabidopsis only and in rice only. Thus, comparison of miRNA promoters between Arabidopsis and rice provides a new perspective for studying miRNA regulation in plants.
23134061	Oryza sativa actin-interacting protein 1 is required for rice growth by promoting actin turnover.	2013	Plant J	Rapid actin turnover is essential for numerous actin-based processes. However, how it is precisely regulated remains poorly understood. Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) has been shown to be an important factor by acting coordinately with actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin in promoting actin depolymerization, the rate-limiting factor in actin turnover. However, the molecular mechanism by which AIP1 promotes actin turnover remains largely unknown in plants. Here, we provide a demonstration that AIP1 promotes actin turnover, which is required for optimal growth of rice plants. Specific down-regulation of OsAIP1 increased the level of filamentous actin and reduced actin turnover, whereas over-expression of OsAIP1 induced fragmentation and depolymerization of actin filaments and enhanced actin turnover. In vitro biochemical characterization showed that, although OsAIP1 alone does not affect actin dynamics, it enhances ADF-mediated actin depolymerization. It also caps the filament barbed end in the presence of ADF, but the capping activity is not required for their coordinated action. Real-time visualization of single filament dynamics showed that OsAIP1 enhanced ADF-mediated severing and dissociation of pointed end subunits. Consistent with this, the filament severing frequency and subunit off-rate were enhanced in OsAIP1 over-expressors but decreased in RNAi protoplasts. Importantly, OsAIP1 acts coordinately with ADF and profilin to induce massive net actin depolymerization, indicating that AIP1 plays a major role in the turnover of actin, which is required to optimize F-actin levels in plants.
23596448	Three Novel Rice Genes Closely Related to the Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 Genes and Their Roles in Xylan Biosynthesis.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Xylan is the second most abundant polysaccharide on Earth, and represents a major component of both dicot wood and the cell walls of grasses. Much knowledge has been gained from studies of xylan biosynthesis in the model plant, Arabidopsis. In particular, the irregular xylem (irx) mutants, named for their collapsed xylem cells, have been essential in gaining a greater understanding of the genes involved in xylan biosynthesis. In contrast, xylan biosynthesis in grass cell walls is poorly understood. We identified three rice genes Os07g49370 (OsIRX9), Os01g48440 (OsIRX9L), and Os06g47340 (OsIRX14), from glycosyltransferase family 43 as putative orthologs to the putative β-1,4-xylan backbone elongating Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 genes, respectively. We demonstrate that the over-expression of the closely related rice genes, in full or partly complement the two well-characterized Arabidopsis irregular xylem (irx) mutants: irx9 and irx14. Complementation was assessed by measuring dwarfed phenotypes, irregular xylem cells in stem cross sections, xylose content of stems, xylosyltransferase (XylT) activity of stems, and stem strength. The expression of OsIRX9 in the irx9 mutant resulted in XylT activity of stems that was over double that of wild type plants, and the stem strength of this line increased to 124% above that of wild type. Taken together, our results suggest that OsIRX9/OsIRX9L, and OsIRX14, have similar functions to the Arabidopsis IRX9 and IRX14 genes, respectively. Furthermore, our expression data indicate that OsIRX9 and OsIRX9L may function in building the xylan backbone in the secondary and primary cell walls, respectively. Our results provide insight into xylan biosynthesis in rice and how expression of a xylan synthesis gene may be modified to increase stem strength.
23204502	Mutant resources for the functional analysis of the rice genome.	2013	Mol Plant	Rice is one of the most important crops worldwide, both as a staple food and as a model system for genomic research. In order to systematically assign functions to all predicted genes in the rice genome, a large number of rice mutant lines, including those created by T-DNA insertion, Ds/dSpm tagging, Tos17 tagging, and chemical/irradiation mutagenesis, have been generated by groups around the world. In this study, we have reviewed the current status of mutant resources for functional analysis of the rice genome. A total of 246 566 flanking sequence tags from rice mutant libraries with T-DNA, Ds/dSpm, or Tos17 insertion have been collected and analyzed. The results show that, among 211 470 unique hits, inserts located in the genic region account for 68.16%, and 60.49% of nuclear genes contain at least one insertion. Currently, 57% of non-transposable-element-related genes in rice have insertional tags. In addition, chemical/irradiation-induced rice mutant libraries have contributed a lot to both gene identification and new technology for the identification of mutant sites. In this review, we summarize how these tools have been used to generate a large collection of mutants. In addition, we discuss the merits of classic mutation strategies. In order to achieve saturation of mutagenesis in rice, DNA targeting, and new resources like RiceFox for gene functional identification are reviewed from a perspective of the future generation of rice mutant resources.
23290459	Tiller number is altered in the ascorbic acid-deficient rice suppressed for L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase.	2013	J Plant Physiol	The tiller of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which determines the panicle number per plant, is an important agronomic trait for grain production. Ascorbic acid (Asc) is a major plant antioxidant that serves many functions in plants. L-Galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH, EC 1.3.2.3) is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of Asc biosynthesis in plants. Here we show that the GLDH-suppressed transgenic rices, GI-1 and GI-2, which have constitutively low (between 30% and 50%) leaf Asc content compared with the wild-type plants, exhibit a significantly reduced tiller number. Moreover, lower growth rate and plant height were observed in the Asc-deficient plants relative to the trait values of the wild-type plants at different tillering stages. Further examination showed that the deficiency of Asc resulted in a higher lipid peroxidation, a loss of chlorophyll, a loss of carotenoids, and a lower rate of CO(2) assimilation. In addition, the level of abscisic acid was higher in GI-1 plants, while the level of jasmonic acid was higher in GI-1 and GI-2 plants at different tillering stages. The results we presented here indicated that Asc deficiency was likely responsible for the promotion of premature senescence, which was accompanied by a marked decrease in photosynthesis. These observations support the conclusion that the deficiency of Asc alters the tiller number in the GLDH-suppressed transgenics through promoting premature senescence and changing phytohormones related to senescence.
23299411	Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB): an integrative and interactive database for rice genomics.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/) has been providing a comprehensive set of gene annotations for the genome sequence of rice, Oryza sativa (japonica group) cv. Nipponbare. Since the first release in 2005, RAP-DB has been updated several times along with the genome assembly updates. Here, we present our newest RAP-DB based on the latest genome assembly, Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 (IRGSP-1.0), which was released in 2011. We detected 37,869 loci by mapping transcript and protein sequences of 150 monocot species. To provide plant researchers with highly reliable and up to date rice gene annotations, we have been incorporating literature-based manually curated data, and 1,626 loci currently incorporate literature-based annotation data, including commonly used gene names or gene symbols. Transcriptional activities are shown at the nucleotide level by mapping RNA-Seq reads derived from 27 samples. We also mapped the Illumina reads of a Japanese leading japonica cultivar, Koshihikari, and a Chinese indica cultivar, Guangluai-4, to the genome and show alignments together with the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene functional annotations through a newly developed browser, Short-Read Assembly Browser (S-RAB). We have developed two satellite databases, Plant Gene Family Database (PGFD) and Integrative Database of Cereal Gene Phylogeny (IDCGP), which display gene family and homologous gene relationships among diverse plant species. RAP-DB and the satellite databases offer simple and user-friendly web interfaces, enabling plant and genome researchers to access the data easily and facilitating a broad range of plant research topics.
23416494	Genome-wide analysis of plant-type II Ca(2+)ATPases gene family from rice and Arabidopsis: potential role in abiotic stresses.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	The Plant Ca(2+)ATPases are members of the P-type ATPase superfamily and play essential roles in pollen tube growth, vegetative development, inflorescence architecture, stomatal opening or closing as well as transport of Ca(2+), Mn(2+) and Zn(2+). Their role in abiotic stress adaptation by activation of different signaling pathways is emerging. In Arabidopsis, the P-type Ca(2+)ATPases can be classified in two distinct groups: type IIA (ECA) and type IIB (ACA). The availability of rice genome sequence allowed performing a genome-wide search for P-type Ca(2+)ATPases proteins, and the comparison of the identified proteins with their homologs in Arabidopsis model plant. In the present study, we identified the P-type II Ca(2+)ATPases from rice by analyzing their phylogenetic relationship, multiple alignment, cis-regulatory elements, protein domains, motifs and homology percentage. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice type IIA Ca(2+)ATPases clustered with Arabidopsis type IIA Ca(2+)ATPases and showed high sequence similarity within the group, whereas rice type IIB Ca(2+)ATPases presented variable sequence similarities with Arabidopsis type IIB members. The protein homology modeling, identification of putative transmembrane domains and conserved motifs of rice P-type II Ca(2+)ATPases provided information on their functions and structural architecture. The analysis of P-type II Ca(2+)ATPases promoter regions in rice showed multiple stress-induced cis-acting elements. The expression profile analysis indicated vital roles of P-type II Ca(2+)ATPases in stress signaling, plant development and abiotic stress responses. The comprehensive analysis and expression profiling provided a critical platform for functional characterization of P-type II Ca(2+)ATPase genes that could be applied in engineering crop plants with modified calcium signaling and homeostatic pathways.
23638098	Comprehensive genomic analysis and expression profiling of phospholipase C gene family during abiotic stresses and development in rice.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Phospholipase C (PLC) is one of the major lipid hydrolysing enzymes, implicated in lipid mediated signaling. PLCs have been found to play a significant role in abiotic stress triggered signaling and developmental processes in various plant species. Genome wide identification and expression analysis have been carried out for this gene family in Arabidopsis, yet not much has been accomplished in crop plant rice.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An exhaustive in-silico exploration of rice genome using various online databases and tools resulted in the identification of nine PLC encoding genes. Based on sequence, motif and phylogenetic analysis rice PLC gene family could be divided into phosphatidylinositol-specific PLCs (PI-PLCs) and phosphatidylcholine- PLCs (PC-PLC or NPC) classes with four and five members, respectively. A comparative analysis revealed that PLCs are conserved in Arabidopsis (dicots) and rice (monocot) at gene structure and protein level but they might have evolved through a separate evolutionary path. Transcript profiling using gene chip microarray and quantitative RT-PCR showed that most of the PLC members expressed significantly and differentially under abiotic stresses (salt, cold and drought) and during various developmental stages with condition/stage specific and overlapping expression. This finding suggested an important role of different rice PLC members in abiotic stress triggered signaling and plant development, which was also supported by the presence of relevant cis-regulatory elements in their promoters. Sub-cellular localization of few selected PLC members in Nicotiana benthamiana and onion epidermal cells has provided a clue about their site of action and functional behaviour.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome wide identification, structural and expression analysis and knowledge of sub-cellular localization of PLC gene family envisage the functional characterization of these genes in crop plants in near future.
23146214	Auxin signal transcription factor regulates expression of the brassinosteroid receptor gene in rice.	2013	Plant J	The phytohormones auxins and brassinosteroids are both essential regulators of physiological and developmental processes, and it has been suggested that they act inter-dependently and synergistically. In rice (Oryza sativa), auxin co-application improves the brassinosteroid response in the rice lamina inclination bioassay. Here, we showed that auxins stimulate brassinosteroid perception by regulating the level of brassinosteroid receptor. Auxin treatment increased expression of the rice brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1. The promoter of OsBRI1 contains an auxin-response element (AuxRE) that is targeted by auxin-response factor (ARF) transcription factors. An AuxRE mutation abolished the induction of OsBRI1 expression by auxins, and OsBRI1 expression was down-regulated in an arf mutant. The AuxRE motif in the OsBRI1 promoter, and thus the transient up-regulation of OsBRI1 expression caused by treatment with indole-3-acetic acid, is essential for the indole-3-acetic acid-induced increase in sensitivity to brassinosteroids. These findings demonstrate that some ARFs control the degree of brassinosteroid perception required for normal growth and development in rice. Although multi-level interactions between auxins and brassinosteroids have previously been reported, our findings suggest a mechanism by which auxins control cellular sensitivity to brassinosteroids, and further support the notion that interactions between auxins and brassinosteroids are extensive and complex.
23357425	Functional characterization of a rice de novo DNA methyltransferase, OsDRM2, expressed in Escherichia coli and yeast.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides is an important epigenetic modification that occurs in most eukaryotic organisms and is established and maintained by various DNA methyltransferases together with their co-factors. There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of a de novo methyltransferase, named OsDRM2, from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The full-length coding region of OsDRM2 was cloned and transformed into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both of these organisms expressed the OsDRM2 protein, which exhibited stochastic de novo methylation activity in vitro at CG, CHG, and CHH di- and tri-nucleotide patterns. Two lines of evidence demonstrated the de novo activity of OsDRM2: (1) a 5'-CCGG-3' containing DNA fragment that had been pre-treated with OsDRM2 protein expressed in E. coli was protected from digestion by the CG-methylation-sensitive isoschizomer HpaII; (2) methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from transformants that had been introduced with OsDRM2 revealed CG and CHG methylation levels of 3.92-9.12%, and 2.88-6.93%, respectively, whereas the mock control S. cerevisiae DNA did not exhibit cytosine methylation. These results were further supported by bisulfite sequencing of the 18S rRNA and EAF5 genes of the transformed S. cerevisiae, which exhibited different DNA methylation patterns, which were observed in the genomic DNA. Our findings establish that OsDRM2 is an active de novo DNA methyltransferase gene with conserved activity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-host species.
23135845	QTL analysis and map-based cloning of salt tolerance gene in rice.	2013	Methods Mol Biol	Most agronomic traits are governed by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and exhibit continuous distribution in a segregating population. The hereditary characteristics of these traits are more complicated than those of monogenic traits. Detection and isolation of these QTLs can greatly improve crop production throughout the world. In recent times, significant progress has been made toward understanding the molecular basis underlying quantitative traits. Herein, we describe a QTL-mapping protocol for detecting and cloning a major QTL regulating rice shoot K(+) concentration under salt stress conditions. This QTL-mapping approach combined with the marker-assisted selection technique can be applied for the elucidation of complex traits in rice and other cereal crops.
23460903	K+ efflux and retention in response to NaCl stress do not predict salt tolerance in contrasting genotypes of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	PLoS One	Sudden elevations in external sodium chloride (NaCl) accelerate potassium (K(+)) efflux across the plasma membrane of plant root cells. It has been proposed that the extent of this acceleration can predict salt tolerance among contrasting cultivars. However, this proposal has not been considered in the context of plant nutritional history, nor has it been explored in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which stands among the world's most important and salt-sensitive crop species. Using efflux analysis with (42)K, coupled with growth and tissue K(+) analyses, we examined the short- and long-term effects of NaCl exposure to plant performance within a nutritional matrix that significantly altered tissue-K(+) set points in three rice cultivars that differ in salt tolerance: IR29 (sensitive), IR72 (moderate), and Pokkali (tolerant). We show that total short-term K(+) release from roots in response to NaCl stress is small (no more than 26% over 45 min) in rice. Despite strong varietal differences, the extent of efflux is shown to be a poor predictor of plant performance on long-term NaCl stress. In fact, no measure of K(+) status was found to correlate with plant performance among cultivars either in the presence or absence of NaCl stress. By contrast, shoot Na(+) accumulation showed the strongest correlation (a negative one) with biomass, under long-term salinity. Pharmacological evidence suggests that NaCl-induced K(+) efflux is a result of membrane disintegrity, possibly as result of osmotic shock, and not due to ion-channel mediation. Taken together, we conclude that, in rice, K(+) status (including efflux) is a poor predictor of salt tolerance and overall plant performance and, instead, shoot Na(+) accumulation is the key factor in performance decline on NaCl stress.
23333982	In vitro selection and field responses of somaclonal variant plants of rice cv PR113 for drought tolerance.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Drought is the major environmental stress that limits rice productivity worldwide. In vitro somaclonal variation using different selection agents has been used for crop improvement. Here, rice plants of cv PR113 were selected in vitro on 30, 50 and 70 g L(-1) polyethylene glycol 6,000 (PEG). Callus growth, proliferation, calli volume (first and second culture) and plantlet regeneration (third culture) were found to be decreased upto a certain level to acquire tolerance to PEG-induced drought. From the field data, 30 g L(-1) PEG lines showed higher vegetative growth (plant height, tiller number, leaf number, shoot weight and root growth) as compared with 50 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines under limited irrigation. The yield parameters-panicle length, panicle weight, grains per panicle, 1,000-grain weight, grain yield per plant, harvest index and grain straw ratio were also higher in 30 g L(-1) PEG lines as compared with 50 g L(-1) PEG lines. The results, therefore indicate that 30 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines were more suited than 50 g L(-1) PEG selected somaclone lines under stress as compared with WT. The finding suggests that rice cv PR113 somaclones generated on PEG are found to be drought tolerant under field condition with better yield.
23400829	Fine-mapping and molecular marker development for Pi56(t), a NBS-LRR gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	The major quantitative trait locus qBR9.1 confers broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, and was mapped to a ~69.1 kb region on chromosome 9 that was inherited from resistant variety Sanhuangzhan No 2 (SHZ-2). Within this region, only one predicted disease resistance gene with nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains was found. Specific markers corresponding to this gene cosegregated with blast resistance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses of susceptible variety Texianzhan 13 (TXZ-13) to SHZ-2 and the resistant backcross line BC-10. We tentatively designate the gene as Pi56(t). Sequence analysis revealed that Pi56(t) encodes an NBS-LRR protein composed of 743 amino acids. Pi56(t) was highly induced by blast infection in resistant lines SHZ-2 and BC-10. The corresponding allele of Pi56(t) in the susceptible line TXZ-13 encodes a protein with an NBS domain but without LRR domain, and it was not induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Three new cosegregating gene-specific markers, CRG4-1, CRG4-2 and CRG4-3, were developed. In addition, we evaluated polymorphism of the gene-based markers among popular varieties from national breeding programs in Asia and Africa. The presence of the CRG4-2 SHZ-2 allele cosegregated with a blast-resistant phenotype in two BC2F1 families of SHZ-2 crossed to recurrent parents IR64-Sub1 and Swarna-Sub1. CRG4-1 and CRG4-3 showed clear polymorphism among 19 varieties, suggesting that they can be used in marker-assisted breeding to combine Pi56(t) with other target genes in breeding lines.
23385369	Changes in rice allelopathy and rhizosphere microflora by inhibiting rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene expression.	2013	J Chem Ecol	Gene expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in allelopathic rice PI312777 was inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi). Transgenic rice showed lower levels of PAL gene expression and PAL activity than wild type rice (WT). The concentrations of phenolic compounds were lower in the root tissues and root exudates of transgenic rice than in those of wild type plants. When barndyardgrass (BYG) was used as the receiver plant, the allelopathic potential of transgenic rice was reduced. The sizes of the bacterial and fungal populations in rice rhizospheric soil at the 3-, 5-, and 7-leaf stages were estimated by using quantitative PCR (qPCR), which showed a decrease in both populations at all stages of leaf development analyzed. However, PI312777 had a larger microbial population than transgenic rice. In addition, in T-RFLP studies, 14 different groups of bacteria were detected in WT and only 6 were detected in transgenic rice. This indicates that there was less rhizospheric bacterial diversity associated with transgenic rice than with WT. These findings collectively suggest that PAL functions as a positive regulator of rice allelopathic potential.
23289725	QTL-seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations.	2013	Plant J	The majority of agronomically important crop traits are quantitative, meaning that they are controlled by multiple genes each with a small effect (quantitative trait loci, QTLs). Mapping and isolation of QTLs is important for efficient crop breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS) and for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the traits. However, since it requires the development and selection of DNA markers for linkage analysis, QTL analysis has been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here we report the rapid identification of plant QTLs by whole-genome resequencing of DNAs from two populations each composed of 20-50 individuals showing extreme opposite trait values for a given phenotype in a segregating progeny. We propose to name this approach QTL-seq as applied to plant species. We applied QTL-seq to rice recombinant inbred lines and F2 populations and successfully identified QTLs for important agronomic traits, such as partial resistance to the fungal rice blast disease and seedling vigor. Simulation study showed that QTL-seq is able to detect QTLs over wide ranges of experimental variables, and the method can be generally applied in population genomics studies to rapidly identify genomic regions that underwent artificial or natural selective sweeps.
23443969	Drought resistance in rice seedlings conferred by seed priming : role of the anti-oxidant defense mechanisms.	2013	Protoplasma	Seed priming is a method by which seeds are subjected to different stress conditions to impart stress adaptation in seedlings germinating and growing under stressful situations. Drought stress is a major reason behind failure of crops. We studied the effects of hydropriming, dehydration priming (induced by PEG), and osmopriming (induced by NaCl and KH(2)PO(4)) on subsequent germination, growth and anti-oxidant defense mechanisms of 2-week-old rice seedlings under continuing dehydration stress. Unprimed seeds grown in PEG showed significantly lower germination and growth along with significantly higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels. Among the priming methods, 5 % PEG priming was found to be the best in terms of germination and growth rate along with the lowest amount of ROS and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde [MDA]) values. MDA levels were reduced significantly by all of the priming methods. Hence, reduction of lipid peroxidation may be a key factor underlying the drought tolerance produced by the priming treatments. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity seemed to bear an excellent correlation with oxidative stress resistance through seed priming. The PEG priming produced minimum peroxidative damage and superior germination and growth rate along with efficient GPX activity, overexpressed MnSOD and maintenance of HSP70 expression in normal as well as in drought condition. Therefore, in PEG-primed seeds the existence of robust protective mechanisms is definitely indicated.
23449645	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways.	2013	Plant Physiol	SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS box transcription factors mediate floral development in association with other regulators. Mutants in five rice (Oryza sativa) SEP genes suggest both redundant and unique functions in panicle branching and floret development. leafy hull sterile1/OsMADS1, from a grass-specific subgroup of LOFSEP genes, is required for specifying a single floret on the spikelet meristem and for floret organ development, but its downstream mechanisms are unknown. Here, key pathways and directly modulated targets of OsMADS1 were deduced from expression analysis after its knockdown and induction in developing florets and by studying its chromatin occupancy at downstream genes. The negative regulation of OsMADS34, another LOFSEP gene, and activation of OsMADS55, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like floret meristem identity gene, show its role in facilitating the spikelet-to-floret meristem transition. Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development. We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation. The multiple effects of OsMADS1 in promoting auxin transport, signaling, and auxin-dependent expression and its direct repression of three cytokinin A-type response regulators show its role in balancing meristem growth, lateral organ differentiation, and determinacy. Overall, we show that OsMADS1 integrates transcriptional and signaling pathways to promote rice floret specification and development.
23400831	Function of the wheat TaSIP gene in enhancing drought and salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Microarray analysis of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant identified a gene of unknown function that was induced by exposure to high levels of salt and subsequently denoted TaSIP (Triticum aestivum salt-induced protein). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that TaSIP expression was induced not only by salt, but also by drought, abscisic acid (ABA), and other environmental stress factors. Transgenic rice plants that expressed an RNA interference construct specific for a rice gene homologous to TaSIP was more susceptible to salt stress than wild-type rice plants. Subcellular localization studies showed that the TaSIP localized to the cell membrane. Under conditions of salt and drought stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed TaSIP showed superior physiological properties compared with control plants, including lower Na(+) content and upregulation of several stress resistance genes. Staining of transgenic tissues with β-glucuronidase (GUS) failed to indicate tissue-specific activity of the full-length TaSIP promoter. Quantitative analysis of GUS fluorescence in transgenic plants treated with ABA or salt stress revealed that the region 1,176-1,410 bp from the start codon contained an ABA-responsive element and that the region 579-1,176 bp from the start codon upstream of the exon contained a salt-stress-responsive element. Based on these results, we conclude that the key part of the TaSIP gene is the region of its promoter involved in salt tolerance.
23424246	NOT2 proteins promote polymerase II-dependent transcription and interact with multiple MicroRNA biogenesis factors in Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Cell	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key regulatory roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes in animals and plants. The elaborate mechanism of miRNA biogenesis involves transcription and multiple processing steps. Here, we report the identification of a pair of evolutionarily conserved NOT2_3_5 domain-containing-proteins, NOT2a and NOT2b (previously known as At-Negative on TATA less2 [NOT2] and VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN2, respectively), as components involved in Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA biogenesis. NOT2 was identified by its interaction with the Piwi/Ago/Zwille domain of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), an interaction that is conserved between rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivation of both NOT2 genes in Arabidopsis caused severe defects in male gametophytes, and weak lines show pleiotropic defects reminiscent of miRNA pathway mutants. Impairment of NOT2s decreases the accumulation of primary miRNAs and mature miRNAs and affects DCL1 but not HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) localization in vivo. In addition, NOT2b protein interacts with polymerase II and other miRNA processing factors, including two cap binding proteins, CBP80/ABH1, CBP20, and SERRATE (SE). Finally, we found that the mRNA levels of some protein coding genes were also affected. Therefore, these results suggest that NOT2 proteins act as general factors to promote the transcription of protein coding as well as miRNA genes and facilitate efficient DCL1 recruitment in miRNA biogenesis.
23454292	Plant growth-promoting bacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NBRISN13 modulates gene expression profile of leaf and rhizosphere community in rice during salt stress.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Growth and productivity of rice and soil inhabiting microbial population is negatively affected by soil salinity. However, some salt resistant, rhizosphere competent bacteria improve plant health in saline stress. Present study evaluated the effect of salt tolerant Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NBRISN13 (SN13) inoculation on rice plants in hydroponic and soil conditions exposed to salinity. SN13 increased plant growth and salt tolerance (NaCl 200 mM) and expression of at least 14 genes under hydroponic and soil conditions in rice. Among these 14 genes 4 (NADP-Me2, EREBP, SOSI, BADH and SERK1) were up-regulated and 2 (GIG and SAPK4) repressed under salt stress in hydroponic condition. In greenhouse experiment, salt stress resulted in accumulation of MAPK5 and down-regulation of the remaining 13 transcripts was observed. SN13 treatment, with or without salt gave similar expression for all tested genes as compared to control. Salt stress caused changes in the microbial diversity of the rice rhizosphere and stimulated population of betaine-, sucrose-, trehalose-, and glutamine-utilizing bacteria in salt-treated rice rhizosphere (SN13 + salt). The observations imply that SN13 confers salt tolerance in rice by modulating differential transcription in a set of at least 14 genes. Stimulation of osmoprotectant utilizing microbial population as a mechanism of inducing salt tolerance in rice is reported for the first time in this study to the best of our knowledge.
23379468	Tolerance of submerged germinating rice to 50-200 mM NaCl in aerated solution.	2013	Physiol Plant	This paper concerns tolerance to 50-200 mM NaCl of submerged rice (Oryza sativa cv. Amaroo) during germination and the first 138-186 h of development in aerated solution. Rice was able to germinate and the seedlings even tolerated exposure to 200 mM NaCl, albeit with severe growth restrictions. After return to 0.3 mM NaCl, growth increased, indicating that even at 200 mM NaCl there was no irreparable injury. Osmotic adjustment was achieved by using Na⁺ and Cl⁻ as the major osmotica. At 200 mM NaCl commenced at sowing, the shoot Na⁺ and Cl⁻ concentrations between 50-110 h were about 210 and 260 mM, respectively, i.e. above the external concentration. Thus, there was a high tissue tolerance to NaCl. The internal concentrations declined subsequently, concurrent with a decline in growth. At 50-200 mM NaCl, the contributions from ions to πsap were 81-92% in roots and 62-74% in shoots. The assessed turgor pressures at 200 mM NaCl were 0.33 MPa in shoots and 0.15 MPa in roots, compared to 0.62 and 0.43 MPa at 0.3 mM NaCl. In the General Discussion section, we compare the different responses of submerged seedlings to the responses of transpiring rice plants, reported in the literature, and suggest that the submerged system is useful to evaluate effects of NaCl on turgor pressure and particularly to establish whether there are specific effects of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ in tissues.
23371559	ER stress response induced by the production of human IL-7 in rice endosperm cells.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Rice seed has been used as a production platform for high value recombinant proteins. When mature human interleukin 7 (hIL-7) was expressed as a secretory protein in rice endosperm by ligating the N terminal glutelin signal peptide and the C terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal to the hIL-7 cytokine to improve production yield, this protein accumulated at levels visible by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. However, the production of this protein led not only to a severe reduction of endogenous seed storage proteins but also to a deterioration in grain quality. The appearance of aberrant grain phenotypes (such as floury and shrunken) was attributed to ER stress induced by the retention of highly aggregated unfolded hIL-7 in the ER lumen, and the expression levels of chaperones such as BiPs and PDIs were enhanced in parallel with the increase in hIL-7 levels. The activation of this ER stress response was shown to be mainly mediated by the OsIRE1-OsbZIP50 signal cascade, based on the appearance of unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA and the induction of OsBiP4&5. Interestingly, the ER stress response could be induced by lower concentrations of hIL-7 versus other types of cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-18. Furthermore, several ubiquitin 26S proteasome-related genes implicated in ER-associated degradation were upregulated by hIL-7 production. These results suggest that severe detrimental effects on grain properties were caused by proteo-toxicity induced by unfolded hIL-7 aggregates in the ER, resulting in the triggering of ER stress.
23397192	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L.	2013	Planta	We previously reported that a rare sugar D-allose, which is the D-glucose epimer at C3, inhibits the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of α-amylase in embryo-less half seeds in rice (Fukumoto et al. 2011). D-Allose suppresses expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes downstream of SLR1 protein in the gibberellin-signaling through hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathway. In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice. Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice. The D-allose-induced expression of OsABF1 was diminished by a hexokinase inhibitor, D-mannoheptulose (MNH). Consistently, D-allose also inhibited Arabidopsis growth, but failed to trigger growth retardation in the glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1. D-Allose activated AtABI5 expression in transgenic gin2 over-expressing wild-type AtHXK1 but not in gin2 over-expressing the catalytic mutant AtHXK1(S177A), indicating that the D-allose phosphorylation by HXK to D-allose 6-phosphate (A6P) is the first step for the up-regulation of AtABI5 gene expression as well as D-allose-induced growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of OsABF1 showed increased sensitivity to D-allose in rice. These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition.
23377188	Visible/near infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics for the prediction of trace element (Fe and Zn) levels in rice leaf.	2013	Sensors (Basel)	Two sensitive wavelength (SW) selection methods combined with visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy were investigated to determine the levels of some trace elements (Fe, Zn) in rice leaf. A total of 90 samples were prepared for the calibration (n = 70) and validation (n = 20) sets. Calibration models using SWs selected by LVA and ICA were developed and nonlinear regression of a least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) was built. In the nonlinear models, six SWs selected by ICA can provide the optimal ICA-LS-SVM model when compared with LV-LS-SVM. The coefficients of determination (R2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and bias by ICA-LS-SVM were 0.6189, 20.6510 ppm and -12.1549 ppm, respectively, for Fe, and 0.6731, 5.5919 ppm and 1.5232 ppm, respectively, for Zn. The overall results indicated that ICA was a powerful way for the selection of SWs, and Vis/NIR spectroscopy combined with ICA-LS-SVM was very efficient in terms of accurate determination of trace elements in rice leaf.
23466746	Ontogenetic changes in vitamin C in selected rice varieties.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is a key antioxidant for both plants and animals. In plants, ascorbate is involved in several key physiological processes including photosynthesis, cell expansion and division, growth, flowering, and senescence. In addition, ascorbate is an enzyme cofactor and a regulator of gene expression. During exposure to abiotic stresses, ascorbate counteracts excessive reactive oxygen species within the cell and protects key molecules, including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, from irreversible damage. In this study we focus on understanding how ascorbate levels are controlled in rice (Oryza sativa) during plant development and in response to light intensity and photoperiod. Our results indicate that in rice ascorbate metabolism follows a different pattern compared to other species. In the rice accessions we analyzed, total foliar ascorbate content increases during development and peaks at the vegetative 2-4 and the reproductive 4 stages, whereas other research has shown that in Arabidopsis thaliana and other dicots, ascorbate content declines with plant age. The pattern in rice does not seem to change when plants were grown under increasing light intensity: 150, 400 or 1200-1500 μmol m(-2) s(-1). We observed little diurnal variation in AsA content in rice and did not see a steady decline during the dark period as has been reported in other species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. The total foliar ascorbate content of twenty-three rice accessions from four major rice subgroups was compared. These genotypes differed as much as eight-fold in ascorbate content at the V2 stage indicating the potential to enhance vitamin C levels in genotypes of global interest via breeding approaches.
23420033	Transposable element-associated microRNA hairpins produce 21-nt sRNAs integrated into typical microRNA pathways in rice.	2013	Funct Integr Genomics	microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs (sRNAs) of ~21 nucleotides (nt) in length processed from foldback hairpins by dicer-like1 (DCL1) or DCL4. They regulate the expression of target mRNAs by base pairing through RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In the RISC, Argonaute1 (AGO1) is the key protein that cleaves miRNA targets at position ten of a miRNA:target duplex. The authenticity of many annotated rice miRNA hairpins is under debate because of their homology to repeat sequences. Some of them, like miR1884b, have been removed from the current release of miRBase based on incomplete information. In this study, we investigated the association of transposable element (TE)-derived miRNAs with typical miRNA pathways (DCL1/4- and AGO1-dependent) using publicly available deep sequencing datasets. Seven miRNA hairpins with 13 unique sRNAs were specifically enriched in AGO1 immunoprecipitation samples and relatively reduced in DCL1/4 knockdown genotypes. Interestingly, these species are ~21-nt long, instead of 24-nt as annotated in miRBase and the literature. Their expression profiles meet current criteria for functional annotation of miRNAs. In addition, diagnostic cleavage tags were found in degradome datasets for predicted target mRNAs. Most of these miRNA hairpins share significant homology with miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, one type of abundant DNA transposons in rice. Finally, the root-specific production of a 24-nt miRNA-like sRNA was confirmed by RNA blot for a novel EST that maps to the 3'-UTR of a candidate pseudogene showing extensive sequence homology to miR1884b hairpin. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that TEs can serve as a driving force for the evolution of some MIRNAs, where co-opting of DICER-LIKE1/4 processing and integration into AGO1 could exapt transcribed TE-associated hairpins into typical miRNA pathways.
23388640	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Flowering time (i.e., heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that originated in the tropics. Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2), a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions. We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1. Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia. Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.
23445750	Salinity tolerance, Na+ exclusion and allele mining of HKT1;5 in Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima: many sources, many genes, one mechanism?	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cultivated rice species (Oryza sativa L. and O. glaberrima Steud.) are generally considered among the crop species most sensitive to salt stress. A handful of lines are known to be tolerant, and a small number of these have been used extensively as donors in breeding programs. However, these donors use many of the same genes and physiological mechanisms to confer tolerance. Little information is available on the diversity of mechanisms used by these species to cope with salt stress, and there is a strong need to identify varieties displaying additional physiological and/or genetic mechanisms to confer higher tolerance.

RESULTS: Here we present data on 103 accessions from O. sativa and 12 accessions from O. glaberrima, many of which are identified as salt tolerant for the first time, showing moderate to high tolerance of high salinity. The correlation of salinity-induced senescence (as judged by the Standard Evaluation System for Rice, or SES, score) with whole-plant and leaf blade Na+ concentrations was high across nearly all accessions, and was almost identical in both O. sativa and O. glaberrima. The association of leaf Na+ concentrations with cultivar-groups was very weak, but association with the OsHKT1;5 allele was generally strong. Seven major and three minor alleles of OsHKT1;5 were identified, and their comparisons with the leaf Na+ concentration showed that the Aromatic allele conferred the highest exclusion and the Japonica allele the least. A number of exceptions to this association with the Oryza HKT1;5 allele were identified; these probably indicate the existence of additional highly effective exclusion mechanisms. In addition, two landraces were identified, one from Thailand and the other from Senegal, that show high tissue tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation in salinity tolerance exists within both cultivated Oryza species, and this is the first report of significant tolerance in O. glaberrima. The majority of accessions display a strong quantitative relationship between tolerance and leaf blade Na+ concentration, and thus the major tolerance mechanisms found in these species are those contributing to limiting sodium uptake and accumulation in active leaves. However, there appears to be genetic variation for several mechanisms that affect leaf Na+ concentration, and rare cases of accessions displaying different mechanisms also occur. These mechanisms show great promise for improving salt tolerance in rice over that available from current donors.
23391577	Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification.	2013	Plant Physiol	Grass cell wall properties influence food, feed, and biofuel feedstock usage efficiency. The glucuronoarabinoxylan of grass cell walls is esterified with the phenylpropanoid-derived hydroxycinnamic acids ferulic acid (FA) and para-coumaric acid (p-CA). Feruloyl esters undergo oxidative coupling with neighboring phenylpropanoids on glucuronoarabinoxylan and lignin. Examination of rice (Oryza sativa) mutants in a grass-expanded and -diverged clade of BAHD acyl-coenzyme A-utilizing transferases identified four mutants with altered cell wall FA or p-CA contents. Here, we report on the effects of overexpressing one of these genes, OsAt10 (LOC_Os06g39390), in rice. An activation-tagged line, OsAT10-D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide-bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p-CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition. Two additional independent OsAt10 overexpression lines show similar changes in FA and p-CA content. Cell wall fractionation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments isolate the cell wall alterations in the mutant to ester conjugates of a five-carbon sugar with p-CA and FA. These results suggest that OsAT10 is a p-coumaroyl coenzyme A transferase involved in glucuronoarabinoxylan modification. Biomass from OsAT10-D1 exhibits a 20% to 40% increase in saccharification yield depending on the assay. Thus, OsAt10 is an attractive target for improving grass cell wall quality for fuel and animal feed.
23421475	Genetic manipulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt in rice: overexpression of truncated glutamate decarboxylase (GAD2) and knockdown of γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) lead to sustained and high levels of GABA accumulation in rice kernels.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid commonly present in all organisms. Because cellular levels of GABA in plants are mainly regulated by synthesis (glutamate decarboxylase, GAD) and catabolism (GABA-transaminase, GABA-T), we attempted seed-specific manipulation of the GABA shunt to achieve stable GABA accumulation in rice. A truncated GAD2 sequence, one of five GAD genes, controlled by the glutelin (GluB-1) or rice embryo globulin promoters (REG) and GABA-T-based trigger sequences in RNA interference (RNAi) cassettes controlled by one of these promoters as well, was introduced into rice (cv. Koshihikari) to establish stable transgenic lines under herbicide selection using pyriminobac. T₁ and T₂ generations of rice lines displayed high GABA concentrations (2-100 mg/100 g grain). In analyses of two selected lines from the T₃ generation, there was a strong correlation between GABA level and the expression of truncated GAD2, whereas the inhibitory effect of GABA-T expression was relatively weak. In these two lines both with two T-DNA copies, their starch, amylose, and protein levels were slightly lower than non-transformed cv. Koshihikari. Free amino acid analysis of mature kernels of these lines demonstrated elevated levels of GABA (75-350 mg/100 g polished rice) and also high levels of several amino acids, such as Ala, Ser, and Val. Because these lines of seeds could sustain their GABA content after harvest (up to 6 months), the strategy in this study could lead to the accumulation GABA and for these to be sustained in the edible parts.
23432654	NYC4, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis THF1, is involved in the degradation of chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence.	2013	Plant J	Yellowing/chlorophyll breakdown is a prominent phenomenon in leaf senescence, and is associated with the degradation of chlorophyll - protein complexes. From a rice mutant population generated by ionizing radiation, we isolated nyc4-1, a stay-green mutant with a defect in chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence. Using gene mapping, nyc4-1 was found to be linked to two chromosomal regions. We extracted Os07g0558500 as a candidate for NYC4 via gene expression microarray analysis, and concluded from further evidence that disruption of the gene by a translocation-related event causes the nyc4 phenotype. Os07g0558500 is thought to be the ortholog of THF1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. The thf1 mutant leaves show variegation in a light intensity-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the Fv /Fm value remained high in nyc4-1 during the dark incubation, suggesting that photosystem II retained its function. Western blot analysis revealed that, in nyc4-1, the PSII core subunits D1 and D2 were significantly retained during leaf senescence in comparison with wild-type and other non-functional stay-green mutants, including sgr-2, a mutant of the key regulator of chlorophyll degradation SGR. The role of NYC4 in degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence is discussed.

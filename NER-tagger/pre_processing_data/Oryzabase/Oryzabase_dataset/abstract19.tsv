16109971	Sequence, annotation, and analysis of synteny between rice chromosome 3 and diverged grass species.	2005	Genome Res	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosome 3 is evolutionarily conserved across the cultivated cereals and shares large blocks of synteny with maize and sorghum, which diverged from rice more than 50 million years ago. To begin to completely understand this chromosome, we sequenced, finished, and annotated 36.1 Mb ( approximately 97%) from O. sativa subsp. japonica cv Nipponbare. Annotation features of the chromosome include 5915 genes, of which 913 are related to transposable elements. A putative function could be assigned to 3064 genes, with another 757 genes annotated as expressed, leaving 2094 that encode hypothetical proteins. Similarity searches against the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed putative homologs for 67% of the chromosome 3 proteins. Further searches of a nonredundant amino acid database, the Pfam domain database, plant Expressed Sequence Tags, and genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize revealed only 853 nontransposable element related proteins from chromosome 3 that lacked similarity to other known sequences. Interestingly, 426 of these have a paralog within the rice genome. A comparative physical map of the wild progenitor species, Oryza nivara, with japonica chromosome 3 revealed a high degree of sequence identity and synteny between these two species, which diverged approximately 10,000 years ago. Although no major rearrangements were detected, the deduced size of the O. nivara chromosome 3 was 21% smaller than that of japonica. Synteny between rice and other cereals using an integrated maize physical map and wheat genetic map was strikingly high, further supporting the use of rice and, in particular, chromosome 3, as a model for comparative studies among the cereals.
16120687	Localization of NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase in rice roots: candidates for providing carbon skeletons to NADH-glutamate synthase.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	In rice roots, transient and cell-type-specific accumulation of both mRNA and protein for NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) occurs after the supply of NH(4) (+) ions. In order to better understand the origin of 2-oxoglutarate for this reaction, we focused on mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in rice roots. Six rice cDNAs encoding a single catalytic (OsIDHa) and two regulatory (OsIDHc;1, OsIDHc;2) IDH subunits and three GDH proteins (OsGDH1-3) were isolated. These genes, except OsGDH3, were expressed in the roots. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsIDHa and OsIDHc;1 transcripts, but not OsGDH1 and OsGDH2 transcripts, accumulated in a similar manner to NADH-GOGAT mRNA along the crown roots after the supply of different forms of inorganic nitrogen. Furthermore, immunolocalization studies revealed the NH(4) (+) induction of IDHa protein in two cell layers of the root surface, i.e. epidermis and exodermis, where NADH-GOGAT also accumulated. The possible relationship between NADH-GOGAT, IDH and GDH is discussed.
15759120	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of the cell-wall invertase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Plant Cell Rep	Cell-wall invertase (CIN) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose for the supply of carbohydrates to sink organs via an apoplastic pathway. To study the CIN genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we isolated cDNA clones showing amino acid similarity to the plant cell wall invertase proteins from a search of rice sequence databases. Profile analyses revealed that the cloned genes are expressed in unique patterns in various organs. For example, transcripts of OsCIN1, OsCIN2, OsCIN4, and OsCIN7 were detected in immature seeds whereas OsCIN3 gene expression was flower-specific. Further transcript analysis of these genes expressed in developing seeds indicated that OsCIN1, OsCIN2, and OsCIN7 might play an important role involving sucrose partitioning to the embryo and endosperm. Sucrose, a substrate of CINs, induced the accumulation of OsCIN1 transcripts in excised leaves and OsCIN2 in immature seeds, while the level of OsCIN5 was significantly down-regulated in excised leaves treated with sucrose. Infecting the tissues with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea) as a biotic stressor increased the expression of OsCIN1, OsCIN4, and OsCIN5, suggesting that these genes may participate in a switch in metabolism to resist pathogen invasion. These results demonstrate that OsCIN genes play diverse roles involving the regulation of metabolism, growth, development, and stress responses.
16552590	Structure, expression, and functional analysis of the hexokinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Planta	Hexokinase (HXK) is a dual-function enzyme that both phosphorylates hexose to form hexose 6-phosphate and plays an important role in sugar sensing and signaling. To investigate the roles of hexokinases in rice growth and development, we analyzed rice sequence databases and isolated ten rice hexokinase cDNAs, OsHXK1 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 1) through OsHXK10. With the exception of the single-exon gene OsHXK1, the OsHXKs all have a highly conserved genomic structure consisting of nine exons and eight introns. Gene expression profiling revealed that OsHXK2 through OsHXK9 are expressed ubiquitously in various organs, whereas OsHXK10 expression is pollen-specific. Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds. The hexokinase activity of the OsHXKs was confirmed by functional complementation of the hexokinase-deficient yeast strain YSH7.4-3C (hxk1, hxk2, glk1). OsHXK4 was able to complement this mutant only after the chloroplast-transit peptide was removed. The subcellular localization of OsHXK4 and OsHXK7, observed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs, indicated that OsHXK4 is a plastid-stroma-targeted hexokinase while OsHXK7 localizes to the cytosol.
16192280	Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	J Biol Chem	Calmodulin (CaM) regulates diverse cellular functions by modulating the activities of a variety of enzymes and proteins. However, direct modulation of transcription factors by CaM has been poorly understood. In this study, we isolated a putative transcription factor by screening a rice cDNA expression library by using CaM:horse-radish peroxidase as a probe. This factor, which we have designated OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor), has structural features similar to Arabidopsis AtSRs/AtCAMTAs and encodes a 103-kDa protein because it contains a CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, three ankyrin repeats, a putative transcriptional activation domain, and five putative CaM-binding motifs. By using a gel overlay assay, gel mobility shift assays, and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that OsCBT has two different types of functional CaM-binding domains, an IQ motif, and a Ca(2+)-dependent motif. To determine the DNA binding specificity of OsCBT, we employed a random binding site selection method. This analysis showed that OsCBT preferentially binds to the sequence 5'-TWCG(C/T)GTKKKKTKCG-3' (W and K represent A or C and T or G, respectively). OsCBT was able to bind this sequence and activate beta-glucuronidase reporter gene expression driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of these sequences in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Green fluorescent protein fusions of two putative nuclear localization signals of OsCBT, a bipartite and a SV40 type, were predominantly localized in the nucleus. Most interestingly, the transcriptional activation mediated by OsCBT was inhibited by co-transfection with a CaM gene. Taken together, our results suggest that OsCBT is a transcription activator modulated by CaM.
16648463	Promoter mutations of an essential gene for pollen development result in disease resistance in rice.	2006	Genes Dev	Disease resistance and sexual reproductive development are generally considered as separate biological processes, regulated by different sets of genes. Here we show that xa13, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development. The dominant allele, Xa13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development. Promoter mutations in Xa13 cause down-regulation of expression during host-pathogen interaction, resulting in the fully recessive xa13 that confers race-specific resistance. The recessive xa13 allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance.
16753815	Alternative splicing and expression analysis of OsFCA (FCA in Oryza sativa L.), a gene homologous to FCA in Arabidopsis.	2006	DNA Seq	A subtracted cDNAs library was constructed using rice (Oryza sativa L.) calli cDNA as driver and differentiating calli cDNA as tester. A novel gene homologous with FCA in Arabidopsis was cloned from rice by screening the SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) library followed by RACE. Four alternative transcripts of OsFCA were cloned from the leaves of rice, and designated as OsFCA-1, OsFCA-2, OsFCA-3 and OsFCA-4 respectively. OsFCA-1 was homologous to FCA-gamma of Arabidopsis and contained several conserved domains (two RNA Recognition Motifs and one WW-domain). OsFCA-2 was 102 bp shorter than OsFCA-1 which caused the WW-domain deletion. The proteins encoded by OsFCA-3 and OsFCA-4 were 101 amino acids shorter than OsFCA-1 at the N-terminal which is a glycine-rich region. The fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis showed that the mRNA of OsFCA-1 is the most abundant in the four splicing variants of rice FCA, and its expression level is much higher in differentiating calli than in calli. The expression of OsFCA-1 is steady in the leaves of three different stage, but up-regulated in young spikelet of primary branch-differentiating stage and down-regulated in young spikelet of pistil and stamen-differentiating stage.
16827922	A brassinolide-suppressed rice MADS-box transcription factor, OsMDP1, has a negative regulatory role in BR signaling.	2006	Plant J	The MADS-box transcription factor-encoding genes are expressed mainly during plant reproductive development, where they play important roles in controlling floral organ initiation and identity. Few previous reports have investigated the functions of MADS-box transcription factors expressed in vegetative tissues. Here we describe the functional characterization of a rice AG-like MADS-box protein, OsMDP1 (Oryza sativa MADS-domain-containing protein 1). A partial cDNA encoding a MADS-box domain was identified via high-throughput screening of rice brassinolide-regulated genes, and the full-length cDNA was subsequently isolated via screening of a cDNA library constructed from rice materials at tillering stage. Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root-elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath. Further studies revealed that transcription of OsMDP1 is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by brassinolide treatment. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations. Moreover, transgenic plants showed hypersensitivities to exogenous brassinolide in terms of lamina joint inclination and coleoptile elongation. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell-wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling.
16453132	GS3, a major QTL for grain length and weight and minor QTL for grain width and thickness in rice, encodes a putative transmembrane protein.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The GS3 locus located in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3 has been frequently identified as a major QTL for both grain weight (a yield trait) and grain length (a quality trait) in the literature. Near isogenic lines of GS3 were developed by successive crossing and backcrossing Minghui 63 (large grain) with Chuan 7 (small grain), using Minghui 63 as the recurrent parent. Analysis of a random subpopulation of 201 individuals from the BC3F2 progeny confirmed that the GS3 locus explained 80-90% of the variation for grain weight and length in this population. In addition, this locus was resolved as a minor QTL for grain width and thickness. Using 1,384 individuals with recessive phenotype (large grain) from a total of 5,740 BC3F2 plants and 11 molecular markers based on sequence information, GS3 was mapped to a DNA fragment approximately 7.9 kb in length. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the target region was identified, which provided complete sequence information for the GS3 candidate. This gene consists of five exons and encodes 232 amino acids with a putative PEBP-like domain, a transmembrane region, a putative TNFR/NGFR family cysteine-rich domain and a VWFC module. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a nonsense mutation, shared among all the large-grain varieties tested in comparison with the small grain varieties, in the second exon of the putative GS3 gene. This mutation causes a 178-aa truncation in the C-terminus of the predicted protein, suggesting that GS3 may function as a negative regulator for grain size. Cloning of such a gene provided the opportunity for fully characterizing the regulatory mechanism and related processes during grain development.
16733757	Sequence comparison of distal and proximal ribosomal DNA arrays in rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosome 9S and analysis of their flanking regions.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) harbors a ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) cluster in the nucleolar-organizing region at the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 9. We isolated and sequenced two genomic clones carrying rice rDNA fragments from this region. The rice rDNA repeat units could be classified into three types based on length, which ranged from 7,928 to 8,934 bp. This variation was due to polymorphism in the number of 254-bp subrepeats in the intergenic spacer (IGS). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis suggested that the rDNA units in rice vary widely in length and that the copy number of the subrepeats in the IGS ranges from 1 to 12 in the rice genome. PCR and Southern blot analyses showed that most rDNA units have three intact and one truncated copies of the subrepeats in the IGS, and distal (telomere-side) rDNA units have more subrepeats than do proximal (centromere-side) ones. Both genomic clones we studied contained rDNA-flanking DNA sequences of either telomeric repeats (5'-TTTAGGG-3') or a chromosome-specific region, suggesting that they were derived from the distal or proximal end, respectively, of the rDNA cluster. A similarity search indicated that retrotransposons appeared more frequently in a 500-kb portion of the proximal rDNA-flanking region than in other subtelomeric regions or sequenced regions of the genome. This study reveals the repetitive nature of the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 9, which consists of telomeric repeats, an rDNA array, and a retrotransposon-rich chromosomal region.
16762031	Characterization and functional analysis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase genes in rice.	2006	Plant J	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), a key enzyme of primary metabolism of higher plants, is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by PEPC kinase (PPCK). Rice has three functional PPCK genes, OsPPCK1, OsPPCK2 and OsPPCK3, all of which have an intron close to the 3' end of the coding region. A novel control mechanism was found for expression of OsPPCK2, namely alternative transcription initiation, and two different transcripts were detected. The four different transcripts of the OsPPCK genes showed different expression patterns. While OsPPCK1 and OsPPCK3 were highly expressed in roots and at low levels in other organs, the two OsPPCK2 transcripts were expressed in all organs. OsPPCK3 was expressed mostly at night, while the long OsPPCK2 transcripts were present in the leaves only in the daytime. Nitrate supplementation of leaves selectively induced expression of both OsPPCK2 transcripts, while phosphate starvation only induced the shorter one. Such diverse expression patterns of OsPPCK genes suggest the importance and variety of strict activity regulation of PEPC in rice. From the correlation between gene expression and the phosphorylation level of PEPC, which was monitored as that of the maize PEPC expressed in transgenic rice plants, it was concluded that the short OsPPCK2 transcripts were expressed in rice leaf mesophyll cells upon nitrogen supplementation and phosphate starvation, whereas OsPPCK3 participated in the nocturnal phosphorylation of PEPC in these cells. Expression of PPCK proteins in rice leaves was detected by immunoblotting using a specific antiserum, and the expression of two different OsPPCK2 proteins derived from alternative transcription initiation was confirmed.
16905871	Two OsGASR genes, rice GAST homologue genes that are abundant in proliferating tissues, show different expression patterns in developing panicles.	2006	Genes Genet Syst	Two different types of genes for rice GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) homologue genes, Oryza sativa GA-stimulated transcript-related gene 1 (OsGASR1) and gene 2 (OsGASR2), were found. Both OsGASR proteins contain a cysteine-rich domain highly conserved among GAST family proteins in their C-terminal regions. Gibberellin A3 (GA3) stimulated expression of both OsGASRs in the wild-type Nipponbare and GA3 synthesis-deficient mutant. Expression of both OsGASRs apparently increased when cell proliferation entered the logarithmic phase, and rapidly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted. RT-PCR analysis indicated different expression patterns of these genes in developing panicles. OsGASR1 was limitedly but strongly expressed in florets while OsGASR2 was expressed in both florets and branches. In situ hybridization showed that they were strongly expressed in the root apical meristem (RAM) and shoot apical meristem (SAM), but little signals were detected in mature leaves. Transient expression of OsGASR-GFP fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells revealed that both OsGASR proteins localized to the apoplasm or cell wall. These results suggest that OsGASR1 and OsGASR2 were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in differentation of panicles.
11935018	A draft sequence of the rice genome (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica).	2002	Science	The genome of the japonica subspecies of rice, an important cereal and model monocot, was sequenced and assembled by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The assembled sequence covers 93% of the 420-megabase genome. Gene predictions on the assembled sequence suggest that the genome contains 32,000 to 50,000 genes. Homologs of 98% of the known maize, wheat, and barley proteins are found in rice. Synteny and gene homology between rice and the other cereal genomes are extensive, whereas synteny with Arabidopsis is limited. Assignment of candidate rice orthologs to Arabidopsis genes is possible in many cases. The rice genome sequence provides a foundation for the improvement of cereals, our most important crops.
11459218	Molecular characterization of Hmg2 gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in rice.	2001	Mol Cells	Three genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR, EC1.1.1.34), which converts HMG-CoA into mevalonate in the early key step of the plant isoprenoid pathway, were isolated by RT-PCR and rice cDNA and genomic library screening. A genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed that HMGR genes are present in three copies in rice. Of the three, the HMGR 2 gene (Hmg2) obtained as a cDNA clone and its genomic clone had 4 exons and 3 introns, and encoded a 576 amino acid peptide containing an open reading frame of 1,728 bp with a calculated Mw. of 61,150. The structure of rice Hmg2 had common features, based on its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homologies, with other plant HMGR genes published to date. Rice Hmg2 transcripts were constitutively detected in all parts of the rice plant, except in lamina and their levels were high particularly in the leaf part of the dark-grown seedlings and mature flowers. Our result showed that mRNA levels of rice Hmg2 were strongly induced in seedlings and influorescence in the early development stage. Rice Hmg2 possibly has a housekeeping role involved in the sterol biosynthesis, among the possible roles of plant HMGR genes that have been suggested in other plants [Weissenborn et al. (1995)].
16606701	Haplotype variation in structure and expression of a gene cluster associated with a quantitative trait locus for improved yield in rice.	2006	Genome Res	By constructing nearly isogenic lines (NILs) that differ only at a single quantitative trait locus (QTL), we fine-mapped the yield-improving QTL qGY2-1 to a 102.9-kb region on rice chromosome 2. Comparison analysis of the genomic sequences in the mapped QTL region between the donor (Dongxiang wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff.) and recurrent (Guichao2, Oryza sativa ssp. indica) parents used for the development of NILs identified the haplotypes of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene cluster, which showed extensive allelic variation. The sequences between genes in the cluster had a very high rate of divergence. More importantly, the genes themselves also differed between two haplotypes: Only 92% identity was observed for one allele, and another allele was found to have completely lost its allelic counterpart in Guichao2. The other six shared genes all showed >98% identity, and four of these exhibited obvious regulatory variation. The same haplotype segments also differed in length (43.9-kb in Guichao2 vs. 52.6-kb in Dongxiang wild rice). Such extensive sequence variation was also observed between orthologous regions of indica (cv. 93-11) and japonica (cv. Nipponbare) subspecies of Oryza sativa. Different rates of sequence divergence within the cluster have resulted in haplotype variability in 13 rice accessions. We also detected allelic expression variation in this gene cluster, in which some genes gave unequal expression of alleles in hybrids. These allelic variations in structure and expression suggest that the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase gene cluster identified in our study should be a particularly good candidate for the source of the yield QTL.
16760221	Involvement of rice cryptochromes in de-etiolation responses and flowering.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	In order to elucidate the function of cryptochromes (cry) in rice, we have characterized all rice CRY genes, including OsCRY1a, OsCRY1b and OsCRY2. Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus. Light treatment affected neither the expression of any of the OsCRY genes nor the stability of their transcripts. However, it was found that Oscry2 protein was negatively regulated by blue light. Moreover, the level of Oscry2 protein also decreased upon red light treatment, and this red light-dependent degradation was shown to be mediated by phytochrome B. Overexpression of OsCRY1 genes resulted in an increased responsiveness to blue light when measuring coleoptile growth inhibition. Moreover, growth of leaf sheaths and blades was also repressed more in OsCRY1 overexpressers than in wild type (WT) under blue light conditions. These results suggest that Oscry1s are responsible for regulating blue light-mediated de-etiolation in rice. In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice.
16722339	Isolation and expression analysis of plastidic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway, existing in cytosolic and plastidic compartments of higher plants. A novel gene encoding plastidic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and designated OsG6PDH2 in this article. Through semiquantitative RT-PCR approach it was found that OsG6PDH2 mRNA was weakly expressed in rice leaves, stems, immature spikes or flowered spikes, and a little higher in roots. However, the expression of OsG6PDH2 in rice seedlings was significantly induced by dark treatment. The complete opening reading frame (ORF) of OsG6PDH2 was inserted into pET30a (+), and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The enzyme activity assay of transformed bacterial cells indicated that OsG6PDH2 encoding product had a typical function of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
15968510	Rice SERK1 gene positively regulates somatic embryogenesis of cultured cell and host defense response against fungal infection.	2005	Planta	Here we report on the isolation and characterization of a somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (OsSERK1) gene in rice (Oryza sativa). The OsSERK1 gene belongs to a small subfamily of receptor-like kinase genes in rice and shares a highly conserved gene structure and extensive sequence homology with previously reported plant SERK genes. Though it has a basal level of expression in various rice organs/tissues, as high expression level was detected in rice callus during somatic embryogenesis. Suppression of OsSERK1 expression in transgenic calli by RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction of shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 14% in the japonica rice Zhonghua11). Overexpression of OsSERK1, however, increased the shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 86%). Interestingly, OsSERK1 is significantly activated by the rice blast fungus, particularly during the incompatible interaction, and is associated with host cell death in Sekigushi lesion mimic mutants. This gene is also inducible by defense signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of OsSERK1 in two rice cultivars led to an increase in host resistance to the blast fungus. Our data suggest that OsSERK1 may partially mediate defense signal transduction in addition to its basic role in somatic embryogenesis.
16924117	Overexpressing a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor enhances drought resistance and salt tolerance in rice.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Drought and salinity are major abiotic stresses to crop production. Here, we show that overexpression of stress responsive gene SNAC1 (STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC 1) significantly enhances drought resistance in transgenic rice (22-34% higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty. The transgenic rice also shows significantly improved drought resistance and salt tolerance at the vegetative stage. Compared with WT, the transgenic rice are more sensitive to abscisic acid and lose water more slowly by closing more stomatal pores, yet display no significant difference in the rate of photosynthesis. SNAC1 is induced predominantly in guard cells by drought and encodes a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor with transactivation activity. DNA chip analysis revealed that a large number of stress-related genes were up-regulated in the SNAC1-overexpressing rice plants. Our data suggest that SNAC1 holds promising utility in improving drought and salinity tolerance in rice.
16800383	Isolation and characterization of OsGSTL1 promoter from rice.	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	OsGSTL1 gene was isolated from the rice genomic library. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of the OsGSTL1 in rice was not induced by chlorsulfuron, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate. In order to investigate the cis-elements of OsGSTL1 promoter, the promoter regions with different lengths were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. All constructs were transformed into onion epidermal cells or A. thaliana plants to detect the expression patterns. In onion epidermal cells, the 160 bp fragment and longer ones were functional for directing GUS expression. In transgenic A. thaliana, the 2,155 bp upstream region of OsGSTL1 gene directed the GUS expression only in cotyledon after germination, but not in the root of young seedlings. In the later seedling, the 2,155 bp upstream region of OsGSTL1 gene directed GUS expression in roots, stems, and leaves. However, the GUS gene directed by a 1,224 bp upstream fragment is expressed in all the checked tissues. These results suggest that the spatiotemporal expression response elements of OsGSTL1 existed in the 5'-upstream region between -2,155 and -1,224 bp.

16359716	Cloning and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin from Oryza sativa.	2006	Toxicon	Lectin plays an important role in defense signaling in plants. A few genes of this family have been cloned. Here we report on a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin in rice. Using sequence information of wheat gene VER2, which we had previously cloned, we were able to amplify a cDNA of OsJAC1 from Oryza sativa by RT-PCR. The cDNA of OsJAC1 was 1172 bp and contained a 921-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding dirigent (amino acids 26-139) and jacalin (amino acids 175-305) domains of 306 amino acids. Comparison of the OsJAC1 sequence with those of other lectins (jacalin) from rice, wheat and other species revealed that OsJAC1 had the 12 amino acid positions conserved in all mannose-binding lectins. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that OsJAC1 expression was present in stems, leaves and young spikes but not young roots; the expression was high in leaves and low in stems and spikes. And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1. To test the activity of OsJAC1, the jacalin domain at the C-terminal was expressed in E. coli. BL21 (DE3). The purified recombinant protein could agglutinate red blood cells of rabbit, and the agglutination activity was strongly inhibited by mannose compared with other carbohydrates. These results indicate that lectin with dirigent and jacalin domains exists in rice as well as wheat. This is the first report of cDNA cloning of mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin with a dirigent domain in N-terminal region from O. sativa.
16829581	Plant cells recognize chitin fragments for defense signaling through a plasma membrane receptor.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a molecular pattern for the recognition of potential pathogens in the innate immune systems of both plants and animals. In plants, chitin oligosaccharides have been known to induce various defense responses in a wide range of plant cells including both monocots and dicots. To clarify the molecular machinery involved in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor, a high-affinity binding protein for this elicitor was isolated from the plasma membrane of suspension-cultured rice cells. Characterization of the purified protein, CEBiP, as well as the cloning of the corresponding gene revealed that CEBiP is actually a glycoprotein consisting of 328 amino acid residues and glycan chains. CEBiP was predicted to have a short membrane spanning domain at the C terminus. Knockdown of CEBiP gene by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of the elicitor-induced oxidative burst as well as the gene responses, showing that CEBiP plays a key role in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in the rice cells. Structural analysis of CEBiP also indicated the presence of two LysM motifs in the extracellular portion of CEBiP. As the LysM motif has been known to exist in the putative Nod-factor receptor kinases involved in the symbiotic signaling between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria, the result indicates the involvement of partially homologous plasma membrane proteins both in defense and symbiotic signaling in plant cells.

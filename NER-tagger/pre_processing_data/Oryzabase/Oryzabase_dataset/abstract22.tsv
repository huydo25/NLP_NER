17625566	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice.	2007	Nature	Silicon is an important nutrient for the optimal growth and sustainable production of rice. Rice accumulates up to 10% silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.
15653800	Isolation and identification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored arabinogalactan proteins and novel beta-glucosyl Yariv-reactive proteins from seeds of rice (Oryza sativa).	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are highly glycosylated extracellular glycoproteins playing important roles in plant growth and development. We have previously reported the possibility that AGPs are involved in the induction of alpha-amylase by gibberellin (GA) in barley aleurone layers by using the beta-glucosyl Yariv reagent (beta-GlcY), which has been presumed to specifically bind AGPs. In this present study, we isolated beta-GlcY-reactive proteins from rice bran rich in aleurone cells. The N-terminal sequences of classical AGP and AG peptides were determined from hydrophilic fractions obtained by reversed phase HPLC. Interestingly, a novel non-specific lipid transfer protein-like protein (OsLTPL1) and a novel early nodulin-like protein (OsENODL1) were also identified in the more hydrophobic fractions from HPLC as beta-GlcY-reactive proteins. Expression analysis of the genes coding for these proteins was performed. While classical AGP, AG peptides and OsLTPL1 were expressed in various parts of rice, OsENODL1 showed temporally and spatially specific expression in the aleurone layers. This new beta-GlcY-reactive protein is a promising candidate for the extracellular signaling factors of GA action in cereal seeds. Furthermore, the possibility that proteins with the AG glycomodule might react with beta-GlcY may broaden the definition of AGPs.
17947413	The extent of linkage disequilibrium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Genetics	Despite its status as one of the world's major crops, linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns have not been systematically characterized across the genome of Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Such information is critical to fully exploit the genome sequence for mapping complex traits using association techniques. Here we characterize LD in five 500-kb regions of the rice genome in three major cultivated rice varieties (indica, tropical japonica, and temperate japonica) and in the wild ancestor of Asian rice, Oryza rufipogon. Using unlinked SNPs to determine the amount of background linkage disequilibrium in each population, we find that the extent of LD is greatest in temperate japonica (probably >500 kb), followed by tropical japonica (approximately 150 kb) and indica (approximately 75 kb). LD extends over a shorter distance in O. rufipogon (<40 kb) than in any of the O. sativa groups assayed here. The differences in the extent of LD among these groups are consistent with differences in outcrossing and recombination rate estimates. As well as heterogeneity between groups, our results suggest variation in LD patterns among genomic regions. We demonstrate the feasibility of genomewide association mapping in cultivated Asian rice using a modest number of SNPs.
18305920	Allelic diversification at the wx locus in landraces of Asian rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	To examine continuous variation of amylose levels in Asian rice (Oryza sativa) landraces, the five putative alleles (Wx a, Wx in, Wx b, Wx op, and wx) at the wx locus were investigated in near-isogenic lines (NILs). Apparent amylose levels ranged from 0.5 to 29.9% in the NILs, showing a positive relation with the levels of Wx gene product, granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) as well as the enzymatic activity per milligram starch granule. Only opaque (Wx op) accessions had an enzymatic activity per GBSS that was reduced to half the level of the others. Nucleotide sequences in the Wx gene were compared among 18 accessions harboring the five different alleles. Each of the Wx alleles had a unique replacement, frame-shift or splice donor site mutation, suggesting that these nucleotide changes could be reflected in phenotype alterations. A molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using the Wx gene indicated that ssp. japonica forms a distinct clade, whereas ssp. indica forms different clades together with the wild progenitor. Unexpectedly, the wx allele of 160 (indica from Taiwan) joined the japonica lineage; however, comparisons using linked genes for two Taiwanese accessions revealed that the wx gene was the product of gene flow from japonica to indica. Therefore, the japonica lineage frequently included Wx in, Wx b and wx, while Wx a and Wx op were found in the other lineages, strongly suggesting that allelic diversification occurred after divergence of the two subspecies. The present results were discussed in relation to the maintenance of agronomically valuable genes in various landraces.
8790446	Mitochondrial plasmid-like DNAs of the B1 family in the genus Oryza: sequence heterogeneity and evolution.	1995	Jpn J Genet	Four kinds of circular plasmid-like DNA, designated B1, B2, B3 and B4, have been found in the mitochondria of Oryza sativa L. with an AA genome. Three novel B1-homologous mitochondrial plasmid-like DNAs, designated, M1, M2 and M3, were isolated in the present study from strains with CC and CCDD genomes in the genus Oryza. We cloned and sequenced these DNAs and found that the sequences of these molecules have wide regions of homology. B1, M2 and M3 each lack about 300 bp of a region that is present in M1 and small repeats were found at the sites of deleted sequences. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that the B1 family differentiated from a common ancient molecule that was similar to M1 via, probably, slipped mispairing during DNA replication at several stages in the evolution in the genus Oryza.
3240862	Organization and nucleotide sequence of genes at both junctions between the two inverted repeats and the large single-copy region in the rice chloroplast genome.	1988	Gene	We describe the isolation and organization, at the nucleotide sequence level, of genes located at the two junctions of the large single-copy region (LSCR) and the two inverted repeats (IRA and IRB) in the rice chloroplast genome. This is the first example where the two junctions are precisely located in a monocot. In rice, a ribosomal protein gene cluster, rpl23-rpl2-rps19, which codes for the ribosomal proteins L23 (rpl23), L2 (rpl2) and S19 (rps19), lies at the ends of the two IRs near the LSCR. The inverted repeats end 45 bp from the translation stop codon of rps19. The gene for the 32-kDa photosystem II protein, psbA, is located at the extremity of the LSCR near IRA, and transcribed towards IRA. The translation stop codon of psbA is 68 bp from the right-hand junction (JLA). Thus, JLA is located within the intergenic sequence of the two genes, rps19 and psbA. Around the left-hand junction (JLB), there is a typical ribosomal protein gene cluster, rpl23-rpl2-rps19-rpl22 (rpl22 for the ribosomal protein L22). The translation start codon of rpl22 is located in the LSCR 25 bp from JLB. Therefore, JLB is located within the intergenic sequence between rps19 and rpl22.
3029686	Rice chloroplast DNA molecules are heterogeneous as revealed by DNA sequences of a cluster of genes.	1987	Nucleic Acids Res	We describe the isolation of two rice chloroplast HindIII fragments (9.5 kb and 5.3 kb) each containing a gene cluster coding for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), beta and epsilon subunits of ATPase (atpB and atpE), tRNAmet (trnM) and tRNAval (trnV). All five genes contained in the 9.5 kb fragment are potentially functional, whereas in the 5.3 kb fragment, rbcL is truncated and atpB is frame-shift mutated. The copy number of the 9.5 kb fragment is 10 times that of the 5.3 kb fragment, indicating that the two fragments are probably located on different chloroplast genomes and represent two different (major and minor) genomic populations. Thus, the rice chloroplast genome appears to be heterogeneous, contrary to general belief. We also describe the isolation of a rice mitochondrial HindIII fragment (6.9 kb) which contains an almost complete transferred copy of this chloroplast gene cluster. In this transferred copy, the coding sequences of rbcL, atpE and trnM contain perfectly normal reading frames, whereas atpB has become grossly defective and trnV is truncated.

17675406	Cell-type specificity of the expression of Os BOR1, a rice efflux boron transporter gene, is regulated in response to boron availability for efficient boron uptake and xylem loading.	2007	Plant Cell	We describe a boron (B) transporter, Os BOR1, in rice (Oryza sativa). Os BOR1 is a plasma membrane-localized efflux transporter of B and is required for normal growth of rice plants under conditions of limited B supply (referred to as -B). Disruption of Os BOR1 reduced B uptake and xylem loading of B. The accumulation of Os BOR1 transcripts was higher in roots than that in shoots and was not affected by B deprivation; however, Os BOR1 was detected in the roots of wild-type plants under -B conditions, but not under normal conditions, suggesting regulation of protein accumulation in response to B nutrition. Interestingly, tissue specificity of Os BOR1 expression is affected by B treatment. Transgenic rice plants containing an Os BOR1 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion construct grown with a normal B supply showed the strongest GUS activity in the steles, whereas after 3 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was elevated in the exodermis. After 6 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was again strong in the stele. Our results demonstrate that Os BOR1 is required both for efficient B uptake and for xylem loading of B. Possible roles of the temporal changes in tissue-specific patterns of Os BOR1 expression in response to B condition are discussed.
8437578	Identification of the entire set of transferred chloroplast DNA sequences in the mitochondrial genome of rice.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	The entire set of transferred chloroplast DNA sequences in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) was identified using clone banks that cover the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial fragments that were homologous to chloroplast DNA were mapped and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences around the termini of integrated chloroplast sequences in the rice mtDNA revealed no common sequences or structures that might enhance the transfer of DNA. Sixteen chloroplast sequences, ranging from 32 bases to 6.8 kb in length, were found to be dispersed throughout the rice mitochondrial genome. The total length of these sequences is equal to approximately 6% (22 kb) of the rice mitochondrial genome and to 19% of the chloroplast genome. The transfer of segments of chloroplast DNA seems to have occurred at different times, both before and after the divergence of rice and maize. The mitochondrial genome appears to have been rearranged after the transfer of chloroplast sequences as a result of recombination at these sequences. The rice mitochondrial DNA contains nine intact tRNA genes and three tRNA pseudogenes derived from the chloroplast genome.
8625419	Multiple initiation sites for transcription of a gene for subunit 1 of F1-ATPase (atp1) in rice mitochondria.	1996	Curr Genet	We identified the sites for the initiation of transcription of a gene for subunit 1 of F1-ATPase (atp1) in rice mitochondrial DNA. Capping and ribonuclease protection experiments in vitro, together with primer extension analysis, demonstrated that there were at least eight transcription initiation sites upstream of atp1. One initiation site, expressed most actively, was flanked by a sequence identical to the consensus promotor motif of rice mitochondrial genes. However, the sequences surrounding the other seven initiation sites exhibited no similarity to the consensus sequence.
8625418	The gene for a subunit of an ABC-type heme transporter is transcribed together with the gene for subunit 6 of NADH dehydrogenase in rice mitochondria.	1996	Curr Genet	We previously identified a chloroplast-derived (ct-derived) sequence of 32 base pairs (bp) in rice mitochondrial DNA that includes a part (30 bp; psitrnI) of a gene for isoleucine tRNA (CAU) of the chloroplast. Analyzing the ct-derived psitrnI, we found that an open reading frame (orf240), which was homologous to the gene for a subunit of an ATP-binding cassette-type (ABC-type) heme transporter, namely helC, of Rhodobacter capsulatus, and a gene for subunit 6 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad6) were located upstream of and downstream from the ct-derived psitrnI, respectively. Northern-blot hybridization and analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that both orf240 and nad6 were co-transcribed in rice mitochondria. An analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of the region of orf240/nad6 from the DNA of some Gramineae suggests that the arrangement of orf240/nad6 was generated in the mitochondrial genome of the genus Oryza during evolution after its divergence from the other Gramineae. Most of the transcripts of orf240 are edited, with a change from cytidine to uridine, at 35 positions. Editing of the RNA changes 33 amino-acid residues among the 240 encoded amino-acid residues, suggesting that the orf240 gene is functional in rice mitochondria.
7509206	Palindromic repeated sequences (PRSs) in the mitochondrial genome of rice: evidence for their insertion after divergence of the genus Oryza from the other Gramineae.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	We have identified a family of small repeated sequences (from 60 to 66 bp in length) in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). There are at least ten copies of these sequences and they are distributed throughout the mitochondrial genome. Each is potentially capable of forming a stem-and-loop structure and we have designated them PRSs (palindromic repeated sequences). Their features are reminiscent of the small dispersed repeats in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of some lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Some of the PRSs of rice mtDNA are located in the intron of the gene for ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) and in the flanking sequence of the gene for chloroplast-like tRNA(Asn) (trnN). analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of these regions from the DNA of some Gramineae suggests that the PRSs were inserted into these regions of the Oryza mtDNA after the divergence of Oryza from the other Gramineae.
7599319	A small repeated sequence contains the transcription initiation sites for both trnfM and rrn26 in rice mitochondria.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	The 76 bp sequence found in the upstream region of a gene for 26S rRNA (rrn26) is duplicated in the upstream region of a gene for initiator methionine tRNA (trnfM) in the mitochondrial genome of rice. An in vitro capping/ribonuclease protection assay and primer extension analysis demonstrated that the transcription of trnfM and of rrn26, which are at least 190 kb from one another in the rice mitochondrial genome, starts from these same sequences in the upstream regions of the respective genes. This result indicates that the short sequence that is duplicated in the upstream regions of trnfM and rrn26 in rice mtDNA is recognized as the promoter of each respective gene.
16987950	The shoot stem cell niche in angiosperms: expression patterns of WUS orthologues in rice and maize imply major modifications in the course of mono- and dicot evolution.	2006	Mol Biol Evol	In Arabidopsis, stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is controlled by a feedback loop between WUS and CLV functions. We have identified WUS orthologues in maize and rice by a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the WOX gene family and subsequent cloning. A single WUS orthologue is present in the rice genome (OsWUS), whereas the allotetraploid maize genome contains 2 WUS paralogues (ZmWUS1 and ZmWUS2). None of the isolated grass WUS orthologues displays an organizing center-type expression pattern in the vegetative SAM as in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the grass-specific expression patterns relate to the specification of new phytomers consistent with the transcriptional expression patterns of TD1 and FON1 (CLV1 orthologues of maize and rice, respectively). Moreover, the grass WUS and CLV1 orthologues are coexpressed in all reproductive meristems, where fasciation and supernumerary floral organs occur in td1 or fon1 loss-of-function mutants. The expression patterns of WUS orthologues in both grass species compared with those of dicots imply that major changes in WUS function, which are correlated with changes in CLV1 signaling, have occurred during angiosperm evolution and raise doubts about the uniqueness of the WUS/CLV antagonism in the maintenance of the shoot stem cell niche in grasses.
17768306	WOX gene phylogeny in Poaceae: a comparative approach addressing leaf and embryo development.	2007	Mol Biol Evol	The phylogeny based on the homeodomain (HD) amino acid sequence of the WOX (WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene family) was established in the 3 major radiations of the Poaceae family: Pooideae (Brachypodium distachyon), Bambusoideae (Oryza sativa), and Panicoideae (Zea mays). The genomes of all 3 grasses contain an ancient duplication in the WOX3 branch, and the cellular expression patterns in maize and rice indicate subfunctionalization of paralogues during leaf development, which may relate to the architecture of the grass leaf and the encircling of the stem. The use of maize WOX gene family members as molecular markers in maize embryo development for the first time allowed us to visualize cellular decisions in the maize proembryo, including specification of the shoot/root axis at an oblique angle to the apical-basal polarity of the zygote. All molecular marker data are compatible with the conclusion that the embryonic shoot/root axis comprises a discrete domain from early proembryo stages onward. Novel cell fates of the shoot and the root are acquired within this distinct morphogenic axis domain, which elongates and thus separates the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem (RAM) anlagen in the maize embryo.
2534354	The nucleotide sequences and expression of genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of ATP synthase from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1989	Jpn J Genet	The genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of ATP synthase were cloned from rice chloroplast DNA. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of these genes were determined. The site of initiation of transcription was examined by S1-mapping analysis. The relation between stability of mRNA and that of a stem and loop structure at the 3' end of mRNA is discussed.
18193402	Detection of quantitative trait loci controlling extremely early heading in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	To clarify the genetic basis of extremely early heading in rice, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using F2 populations from two genetically wide cross combinations, Hayamasari/Kasalath (HaF2) and Hoshinoyume/Kasalath (HoF2). Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume are extremely early-heading japonica cultivars. Photoperiod sensitivity is completely lost in Hayamasari and weak in Hoshinoyume. Three QTLs, QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7), and QTL(chr8), for days-to-heading (DTH) in HaF2 were detected on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, respectively, and QTL(chr6) and QTL(chr7) were detected in HoF2. On the basis of the chromosomal locations, QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7), and QTL(chr8) may be likely to be Hd1, Hd4, and Hd5, respectively, which had been detected previously as QTLs for DTH in an F2 population of NipponbarexKasalath. Alleles of QTL(chr7) decreased DTH dramatically in both Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume, suggesting that QTL(chr7) has a major role in determining extremely early heading. In addition, allele-specific interactions were detected between QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7) and QTL(chr8). This result suggests that not only allelic differences but also epistatic interactions contribute to extremely early heading. QTL(chr8) was detected in HaF2, but not in HoF2, suggesting that it determines the difference in DTH between Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume. A major QTL was also detected in the region of QTL(chr8) in QTL analysis using an F2 population of HayamasarixHoshinoyume. This result supports the idea that QTL(chr8) is a major factor that determines the difference in DTH between Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume, and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity.
18308732	A novel NAC transcription factor, IDEF2, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants.	2008	J Biol Chem	Iron is essential for most living organisms, and thus iron deficiency poses a major abiotic stress in crop production. Plants induce iron utilization systems under conditions of low iron availability, but the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation under iron deficiency remain largely unknown. We identified a novel transcription factor of rice and barley, IDEF2, which specifically binds to the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element 2 (IDE2) by yeast one-hybrid screening. IDEF2 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the NAC transcription factor family and exhibits novel properties of sequence recognition. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cyclic amplification and selection of targets experiment revealed that IDEF2 predominantly recognized CA(A/C)G(T/C)(T/C/A)(T/C/A) within IDE2 as the core-binding site. IDEF2 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves. Repression of the function of IDEF2 by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) caused aberrant iron homeostasis in rice. Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes. Many genes with repressed expression in IDEF2 RNAi rice possessed the IDEF2-binding core sites in their promoters, and the flanking sequences were also highly homologous to IDE2. IDEF2 bound to OsYSL2 promoter region containing the binding core site, suggesting direct regulation of OsYSL2 expression. These results reveal novel cis-element/trans-factor interactions functionally associated with iron homeostasis.
17634747	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced via geranylgeranyl diphosphate in suspension-cultured rice cells after treatment with a chitin elicitor. We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1, EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression (LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.
17893735	Different patterns of genealogical relationships found in the two major QTLs causing reduction of seed shattering during rice domestication.	2007	Genome	The three quantitative trait loci (qSH1, qSH3, and qSH4) causing reduction of seed shattering were investigated to examine their relative importance during rice domestication. The qSH1 and qSH4 loci showed a distinct effect on the reduction of shattering, compared with the qSH3 locus. Fine mapping and sequence analysis strongly suggested that the qSH1 and qSH4 loci are the same as the recently reported genes. A non-shattering allele at qSH1 drastically changed the shattering phenotype to a non-shattering phenotype even in the presence of shattering alleles at the qSH3 and qSH4 loci, showing that qSH1 is genetically epistatic to the other loci. The level of the reduction in sequence diversity was compared between the qSH1 and qSH4 regions. The sequence diversity was severely reduced in the qSH1 region of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica compared with that of O. sativa subsp. indica, despite that the level of diversity was similarly reduced at the qSH4 region in the 2 subspecies. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined sequences of the flanking sites showed different patterns in the 2 subspecies. The 2 subspecies formed a single clade with respect to qSH4, whereas they were separated into different lineages with respect to qSH1, suggesting that these loci had different histories during rice domestication.
17913295	Overexpression of transcription factor OsLFL1 delays flowering time in Oryza sativa.	2008	J Plant Physiol	Flowering time is regulated by genetic programs and environment signals in plants. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flower induction. Genotype W378 is a rice (Oryza sativa) late-flowering mutant selected from our collections of T-DNA insertion line. The T-DNA flanking gene in mutant W378 codes OsLFL1 (O. sativa LEC2 and FUSCA3 Like 1), a putative B3 DNA-binding domain-containing transcription factor. In wild-type rice OsLFL1 is expressed exclusively in spikes and young embryos, while in mutant W378 it is ectopically expressed. Introduction of OsLFL1-RNAi into mutant W378 successfully down-regulated OsLFL1 expression and restored flowering to almost normal time, indicating that overexpression of OsLFL1 confers late flowering for mutant W378. The flowering-promoting gene Ehd1 and its downstream genes are all down-regulated in W378. Thus, overexpression of OsLFL1 might delay the flowering of W378 by repressing the expression of Ehd1.
18562767	Mutation of the rice Narrow leaf1 gene, which encodes a novel protein, affects vein patterning and polar auxin transport.	2008	Plant Physiol	The size and shape of the plant leaf is an important agronomic trait. To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant named narrow leaf1 (nal1), which exhibits a characteristic phenotype of narrow leaves. In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins. Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation analyses demonstrated that Nal1 encodes a plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function. We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity. These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth.
17506327	OsWRKY13 mediates rice disease resistance by regulating defense-related genes in salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent signaling.	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Although 109 WRKY genes have been identified in the rice genome, the functions of most are unknown. Here, we show that OsWRKY13 plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance. Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility. This overexpression was accompanied by the activation of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes and SA-responsive genes and the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes and JA-responsive genes. OsWRKY13 bound to the promoters of its own and at least three other genes in SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. Its DNA-binding activity was influenced by pathogen infection. These results suggest that OsWRKY13, as an activator of the SA-dependent pathway and a suppressor of JA-dependent pathways, mediates rice resistance by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a subset of genes acting both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. Furthermore, OsWRKY13 will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider-spectrum and whole-growth-stage resistance rice in breeding programs.
18467323	Expression pattern and activity of six glutelin gene promoters in transgenic rice.	2008	J Exp Bot	The shortage of strong endosperm-specific expression promoters for driving the expression of recombinant protein genes in cereal endosperm is a major limitation in obtaining the required level and pattern of expression. Six promoters of seed storage glutelin genes (GluA-1, GluA-2, GluA-3, GluB-3, GluB-5, and GluC) were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA by PCR. Their spatial and temporal expression patterns and expression potential in stable transgenic rice plants were examined with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) used as a reporter gene. All the promoters showed the expected spatial expression within the endosperm. The GluA-1, GluA-2, and GluA-3 promoters directed GUS expression mainly in the outer portion (peripheral region) of the endosperm. The GluB-5 and GluC promoters directed GUS expression in the whole endosperm, with the latter expressed almost evenly throughout the whole endosperm, a feature different from that of other rice glutelin gene promoters. The GluB-3 promoter directed GUS expression solely in aleurone and subaleurone layers. Promoter activities examined during seed maturation showed that the GluC promoter had much higher activity than the other promoters. These promoters are ideal candidates for achieving gene expression for multiple purposes in monocot endosperm but avoid promoter homology-based gene silencing. The GluC promoter did not contain the endosperm specificity-determining motifs GCN4, AACA, and the prolamin-box, which suggests the existence of additional regulatory mechanism in determining endosperm specificity.
17339651	OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	J Exp Bot	Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is released as a by-product of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent reactions central to ethylene, polyamine, or phytosiderophore biosynthesis. MTA is hydrolysed by methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTN; EC 3.2.2.16) into adenine and methylthioribose which is processed through the methionine (Met) cycle to produce a new molecule of AdoMet. In deepwater rice, submergence enhances ethylene biosynthesis, and ethylene in turn influences the methionine cycle through positive feedback regulation of the acireductone dioxygenase gene OsARD1. In rice, MTN is encoded by a single gene designated OsMTN. Recombinant OsMTN enzyme had a KM for MTA of 2.1 mM and accepted a wide array of 5' substitutions of the substrate. OsMTN also metabolized S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) with 15.9% the rate of MTA. OsMTN transcripts and OsMTN-specific activity increased slowly and in parallel upon submergence, indicating that regulation occurred mainly at the transcriptional level. Neither ethylene, MTA, nor Met regulated OsMTN expression. Analysis of steady-state metabolite levels showed that MTN activity was sufficiently high to prevent Met and AdoMet depletion during long-term ethylene biosynthesis.
18583359	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	2008	Nucleic Acids Res	The DMC1 protein, a meiosis-specific DNA recombinase, catalyzes strand exchange between homologous chromosomes. In rice, two Dmc1 genes, Dmc1A and Dmc1B, have been reported. Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined. In the present study, we expressed the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins in bacteria and purified them. The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor. The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs. In contrast, the human DMC1 protein strictly required RPA to promote strand exchange with these long DNA substrates. The strand-exchange activity of the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein was much higher than that of the DMC1B protein. Consistently, the DNA-binding activity of the DMC1A protein was higher than that of the DMC1B protein. These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice.
2791032	Nucleotide sequence and molecular characterization of plasmid-like DNAs from mitochondria of cytoplasmic male-sterile rice.	1989	Curr Genet	Two plasmid-like DNAs, B2 and B3, were isolated from mitochondria of the cytoplasmic male-sterile rice, A-58 CMS. Molecular clones having their complete sequences were constructed and used as probes of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes by Southern hybridization. No evidence was found that integrated copies of either one exist in the main mitochondrial genome, but sequences homologous to both were present in the nuclear genome. The complete nucleotide sequences of B2 and B3 were established and compared to those of rice B1 and B4 and to the 1.9- and the 1.4-kbp plasmid-like DNAs of maize. Many of the sequences were common to both plant species.
18604208	Deletion in a gene associated with grain size increased yields during rice domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	The domestication of crops involves a complex process of selection in plant evolution and is associated with changes in the DNA regulating agronomically important traits. Here we report the cloning of a newly identified QTL, qSW5 (QTL for seed width on chromosome 5), involved in the determination of grain width in rice. Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in qSW5 resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice grains. In addition, we mapped two other defective functional nucleotide polymorphisms of rice domestication-related genes with genome-wide RFLP polymorphisms of various rice landraces. These analyses show that the qSW5 deletion had an important historical role in artificial selection, propagation of cultivation and natural crossings in rice domestication, and shed light on how the rice genome was domesticated.
17520342	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of OsBISERK1, a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, during disease resistance responses in rice.	2008	Mol Biol Rep	A rice gene, OsBISERK1, encoding a protein belonging to SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) type of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) was identified. The OsBISERK1 encodes a 624 aa protein with high level of identity to known plant SERKs. OsBISERK1 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide, a leucine zipper, and five leucine-rich repeat motifs in the extracellular domain; the cytoplasmic region carries a proline-rich region and a single transmembrane domain, as well as a conserved intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain. OsBISERK1 has a low level of basal expression in leaf tissue. However, expression of OsBISERK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice, and also up-regulated after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during incompatible interaction between a blast-resistant rice genotype and M. grisea. The results suggest that OsBISERK1 may be involved in disease resistance responses in rice.
17727616	The rice nuclear gene, VIRESCENT 2, is essential for chloroplast development and encodes a novel type of guanylate kinase targeted to plastids and mitochondria.	2007	Plant J	Guanylate kinase (GK) is a critical enzyme in guanine nucleotide metabolism pathways, catalyzing the phosphorylation of (d)GMP to (d)GDP. Here we show that a novel gene, VIRESCENT 2 (V2), encodes a new type of GK (designated pt/mtGK) that is localized in plastids and mitochondria. We initially identified the V2 gene by positional cloning of the rice v2 mutant. The v2 mutant is temperature-sensitive and develops chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures. The v2 mutation causes inhibition of chloroplast differentiation; in particular, it disrupts the chloroplast translation machinery during early leaf development [Sugimoto et al. (2004)Plant Cell Physiol. 45, 985]. In the bacterial and animal species studied to date, GK is localized in the cytoplasm and participates in maintenance of the guanine nucleotide pools required for many fundamental cellular processes. Phenotypic analysis of rice seedlings with RNAi knockdown of cytosolic GK (designated cGK) showed that cGK is indispensable for the growth and development of plants, but not for chloroplast development. Thus, rice has two types of GK, as does Arabidopsis, suggesting that higher plants have two types of GK. Our results suggest that, of the two types of GK, only pt/mtGK is essential for chloroplast differentiation.
18666953	Cloning and expression analysis of rice sucrose transporter genes OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Two sucrose transporter (SUT) cDNAs, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing results indicate they are 1,531 bp and 1,635 bp in length including complete open reading frame 1,506 bp and 1,608 bp, which encode 502 amino acids and 536 amino acids, respectively. The TopPred program suggested that both sucrose transporter proteins, OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z, consist of potentially 12 transmembrane domains. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the gene expression patterns of OsSUT2M and OsSUT5Z. In vegetative organs, transcripts of OsSUT2M were higher in source leaf blades than in other organs at the same development stage, whereas transcripts of OsSUT5Z were less traceable in all organs investigated. In reproductive organs, both transcripts of these two genes were high in panicles from the booting stage to 7 days after flowering (DAF) and then sharply declined. The potential physiology functions of these two sucrose transporters are discussed.
18676878	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice.	2008	Plant Cell	Postembryonic development in plants depends on the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM). In Arabidopsis thaliana, CLAVATA signaling negatively regulates the size of the stem cell population in the SAM by repressing WUSCHEL. In other plants, however, studies of factors involved in stem cell maintenance are insufficient. Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa). Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM. Constitutive expression of FCP1 results in consumption of the SAM in the vegetative phase, and application of an FCP1 CLE peptide in vitro disturbs root development by misspecification of cell fates in the RAM. FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions. Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2. Our results suggest that, although the basic framework of meristem maintenance is conserved in the angiosperms, the functions of the individual factors have diversified during evolution.
16972867	Biosynthesis and secretion of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores in zinc-deficient barley.	2006	Plant J	Mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) are metal chelators that are produced in graminaceous plants in response to iron (Fe) deficiency, but current evidence regarding secretion of MAs during zinc (Zn) deficiency is contradictory. Our studies using HPLC analysis showed that Zn deficiency induces the synthesis and secretion of MAs in barley plants. The levels of the HvNAS1, HvNAAT-A, HvNAAT-B, HvIDS2 and HvIDS3 transcripts, which encode the enzymes involved in the synthesis of MAs, were increased in Zn-deficient roots. Studies of the genes involved in the methionine cycle using microarray analysis showed that the transcripts of these genes were increased in both Zn-deficient and Fe-deficient barley roots, probably allowing the plant to meet its demand for methionine, a precursor in the synthesis of MAs. In addition, HvNAAT-B transcripts were detected in Zn-deficient shoots, but not in those that were deficient in Fe. Increased synthesis of MAs in Zn-deficient barley was not due to a deficiency of Fe, because Zn-deficient barley accumulated more Fe than did the control plants, ferritin transcripts were increased in Zn-deficient plants, and Zn deficiency promoted Fe transport from root to shoot. Moreover, analysis using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS) confirmed that more 62Zn(II)-MAs than 62Zn2+ were absorbed by the roots of Zn-deficient barley plants. These data suggest that the increased biosynthesis and secretion of MAs arising from a shortage of Zn are not due to an induced Fe deficiency, and that secreted MAs are effective in absorbing Zn from the soil.
17696613	Global dissemination of a single mutation conferring white pericarp in rice.	2007	PLoS Genet	Here we report that the change from the red seeds of wild rice to the white seeds of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) resulted from the strong selective sweep of a single mutation, a frame-shift deletion within the Rc gene that is found in 97.9% of white rice varieties today. A second mutation, also within Rc, is present in less than 3% of white accessions surveyed. Haplotype analysis revealed that the predominant mutation originated in the japonica subspecies and crossed both geographic and sterility barriers to move into the indica subspecies. A little less than one Mb of japonica DNA hitchhiked with the rc allele into most indica varieties, suggesting that other linked domestication alleles may have been transferred from japonica to indica along with white pericarp color. Our finding provides evidence of active cultural exchange among ancient farmers over the course of rice domestication coupled with very strong, positive selection for a single white allele in both subspecies of O. sativa.
17350935	Assimilation of ammonium ions and reutilization of nitrogen in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	J Exp Bot	A major source of inorganic nitrogen for rice plants grown in paddy soil is ammonium ions. The ammonium ions are actively taken up by the roots via ammonium transporters and subsequently assimilated into the amide residue of glutamine (Gln) by the reaction of glutamine synthetase (GS) in the roots. The Gln is converted into glutamate (Glu), which is a central amino acid for the synthesis of a number of amino acids, by the reaction of glutamate synthase (GOGAT). Although a small gene family for both GS and GOGAT is present in rice, ammonium-dependent and cell type-specific expression suggest that cytosolic GS1;2 and plastidic NADH-GOGAT1 are responsible for the primary assimilation of ammonium ions in the roots. In the plant top, approximately 80% of the total nitrogen in the panicle is remobilized through the phloem from senescing organs. Since the major form of nitrogen in the phloem sap is Gln, GS in the senescing organs and GOGAT in developing organs are important for nitrogen remobilization and reutilization, respectively. Recent work with a knock-out mutant of rice clearly showed that GS1;1 is responsible for this process. Overexpression studies together with age- and cell type-specific expression strongly suggest that NADH-GOGAT1 is important for the reutilization of transported Gln in developing organs. The overall process of nitrogen utilization within the plant is discussed.
18664295	Genomic and expression analysis of glycosyl hydrolase family 35 genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Many plant beta-galactosidases (Bgals) have been well characterized and their deduced biological functions mainly involve degradation of structural pectins, xyloglucans or arabinogalactoproteins in plant cell walls. However, gene multiplicity in glycosyl hydrolase family 35 (GH35), to which these proteins belong, implies diverse functions. In this study, the gene multiplicity, apparent evolutionary relationships and transcript expression of rice Bgal genes were examined, in order to predict their biological functions.

RESULTS: Fifteen rice Bgal genes were identified in the plant genome, one of which encodes a protein similar to animal Bgals (OsBgal9), and the remaining 14 fall in a nearly plant-specific subfamily of Bgals. The presence of both classes of Bgals in bryophytes, as well as vascular plants, suggests both gene lineages were present early in plant evolution. All 15 proteins were predicted to contain secretory signal sequences, suggesting they have secretory pathway or external roles. RT-PCR and database analysis found two distinct lineages to be expressed nearly exclusively in reproductive tissues and to be closely related to Arabidopsis Bgals expressed most highly in flower and pollen. On the other hand, OsBgal6 is expressed primarily in young vegetative tissues, and alternative splicing in panicle prevents its production of full-length protein in this reproductive tissue. OsBgal11 also showed alternative splicing to produce different length proteins. OsBgal13 produced by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed alpha-L-arabinoside in addition to beta-D-galactoside and beta-(1-->3)-, beta-(1-->4)- and beta-(1-->6)- linked galacto-oligosaccharides.

CONCLUSION: Rice GH35 contains fifteen genes with a diversity of protein sequences, predicted locations and expression and splicing patterns that suggest that OsBgals enzymes may play a variety of roles in metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids.
17449652	Gene targeting by homologous recombination as a biotechnological tool for rice functional genomics.	2007	Plant Physiol	The modification of an endogenous gene into a designed sequence by homologous recombination, termed gene targeting (GT), has broad implications for basic and applied research. Rice (Oryza sativa), with a sequenced genome of 389 Mb, is one of the most important crops and a model plant for cereals, and the single-copy gene Waxy on chromosome 6 has been modified with a frequency of 1% per surviving callus by GT using a strong positive-negative selection. Because the strategy is independent of gene-specific selection or screening, it is in principle applicable to any gene. However, a gene in the multigene family or a gene carrying repetitive sequences may preclude efficient homologous recombination-promoted GT due to the occurrence of ectopic recombination. Here, we describe an improved GT procedure whereby we obtained nine independent transformed calli having the alcohol dehydrogenase2 (Adh2) gene modified with a frequency of approximately 2% per surviving callus and subsequently isolated eight fertile transgenic plants without the concomitant occurrence of undesirable ectopic events, even though the rice genome carries four Adh genes, including a newly characterized Adh3 gene, and a copy of highly repetitive retroelements is present adjacent to the Adh2 gene. The results indicate that GT using a strong positive-negative selection can be widely applicable to functional genomics in rice and presumably in other higher plants.
16188032	The sequence of rice chromosomes 11 and 12, rich in disease resistance genes and recent gene duplications.	2005	BMC Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice is an important staple food and, with the smallest cereal genome, serves as a reference species for studies on the evolution of cereals and other grasses. Therefore, decoding its entire genome will be a prerequisite for applied and basic research on this species and all other cereals.

RESULTS: We have determined and analyzed the complete sequences of two of its chromosomes, 11 and 12, which total 55.9 Mb (14.3% of the entire genome length), based on a set of overlapping clones. A total of 5,993 non-transposable element related genes are present on these chromosomes. Among them are 289 disease resistance-like and 28 defense-response genes, a higher proportion of these categories than on any other rice chromosome. A three-Mb segment on both chromosomes resulted from a duplication 7.7 million years ago (mya), the most recent large-scale duplication in the rice genome. Paralogous gene copies within this segmental duplication can be aligned with genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize. Although these gene copies are preserved on both chromosomes, their expression patterns have diverged. When the gene order of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 was compared to wheat gene loci, significant synteny between these orthologous regions was detected, illustrating the presence of conserved genes alternating with recently evolved genes.

CONCLUSION: Because the resistance and defense response genes, enriched on these chromosomes relative to the whole genome, also occur in clusters, they provide a preferred target for breeding durable disease resistance in rice and the isolation of their allelic variants. The recent duplication of a large chromosomal segment coupled with the high density of disease resistance gene clusters makes this the most recently evolved part of the rice genome. Based on syntenic alignments of these chromosomes, rice chromosome 11 and 12 do not appear to have resulted from a single whole-genome duplication event as previously suggested.
18193457	Identification, characterization and interaction of HAP family genes in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	A HAP complex, which consists of three subunits, namely HAP2 (also called NF-YA or CBF-B), HAP3 (NF-YB/CBF-A) and HAP5 (NF-YC/CBF-C), binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. We identified 10 HAP2 genes, 11 HAP3 genes and 7 HAP5 genes in the rice genome. All the three HAP family genes encode a protein with a conserved domain in each family and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence. These genes showed various expression patterns depending on genes, and various combinations of overlapped expression of the HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 genes were observed. Furthermore, protein interaction analyses showed interaction of OsHAP3A, a ubiquitously expressed HAP3 subunit of rice, with specific members of HAP5. These results indicate that the formation of specific complex with various HAP subunits combinations can be achieved by both tissue specific expression of three subunit genes and specific interaction of three subunit proteins. This may suggest that the HAP complexes may control various aspects of rice growth and development through tissue specific expression and complex formation of three subunit members.
17938177	Calcium-activated (p)ppGpp synthetase in chloroplasts of land plants.	2007	J Biol Chem	The genetic system of chloroplasts, including the machinery for transcription, translation, and DNA replication, exhibits substantial similarity to that of eubacteria. Chloroplasts are also thought to possess a system for generating guanosine 5'-triphosphate ((p)ppGpp), which triggers the stringent response in eubacteria, with genes encoding chloroplastic (p)ppGpp synthetase having been identified. We now describe the identification and characterization of genes (OsCRSH1, OsCRSH2, and OsCRSH3) for a novel type of (p)ppGpp synthetase in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide at the NH(2) terminus, a central RelA-SpoT-like domain, and two EF-hand motifs at the COOH terminus. The recombinant OsCRSH1 protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro, and genetic complementation analysis revealed that expression of OsCRSH1 suppressed the phenotype of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the RelA and SpoT enzymes. Biochemical analysis showed that the OsCRSH proteins possess (p)ppGpp synthetase activity that is dependent both on Ca(2+) and on the EF-hand motifs. A data base search identified a CRSH homolog in the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that such genes are conserved among both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous land plants. CRSH proteins thus likely function as Ca(2+)-activated (p)ppGpp synthetases in plant chloroplasts, implicating both Ca(2+) and (p)ppGpp signaling in regulation of the genetic system of these organelles.
18247046	Characterization of plant XRCC1 and its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	2008	Planta	In plants, there are no DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) and DNA ligase III (Lig3) genes. Thus, the plant short-patch base excision repair (short-patch BER) pathway must differ considerably from that in mammals. We characterized the rice (Oryza Sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) homologue of the mammalian X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1), a well-known BER protein. The plant XRCC1 lacks the N-terminal domain (NTD) which is required for Pol beta binding and is essential for mammalian cell survival. The recombinant rice XRCC1 (OsXRCC1) protein binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and also interacts with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) in a pull-down assay. Through immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that OsXRCC1 forms a complex with PCNA in vivo. OsXRCC1 mRNA was expressed in all rice organs and was induced by application of bleomycin, but not of MMS, H(2)O(2) or UV-B. Bleomycin also increased the fraction of OsXRCC1 associated with chromatin. These results suggest that OsXRCC1 contributes to DNA repair pathways that differ from the mammalian BER system.
17644730	Molecular interactions of a soluble gibberellin receptor, GID1, with a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, and gibberellin.	2007	Plant Cell	GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) encodes a soluble gibberellin (GA) receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Previously, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that the GID1-GA complex directly interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling. Here, we demonstrated, by pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, that the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction also occurs in planta. GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to GID1 in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta. Domain analyses of SLR1 using Y2H, gel filtration, and BiFC methods revealed that the DELLA and TVHYNP domains of SLR1 are required for the GID1-SLR1 interaction. To identify the important regions of GID1 for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of GID1, such as the spontaneous mutant GID1s, N- and C-terminal truncated GID1s, and mutagenized GID1 proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala. The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the GID1 molecule. When we plotted these residues on the GID1 structure predicted by analogy with HSL tertiary structure, many residues were located at regions corresponding to the substrate binding pocket and lid. Furthermore, the GA-GID1 interaction was stabilized by SLR1. Based on these observations, we proposed a molecular model for interaction between GA, GID1, and SLR1.
18185911	A novel lipoxygenase gene from developing rice seeds confers dual position specificity and responds to wounding and insect attack.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	OsLOX1 is a novel full-length cDNA isolated from developing rice seeds. We have examined its biochemical properties and expression patterns. The protein has dual positional specificity, as it releases both C-9 and C-13 oxidized products in a 4:3 ratio. OsLOX1 transcripts were detected at low abundance in immature seeds and newly germinated seedlings, but accumulate rapidly and transiently in response to wounding or brown planthopper (BPH) attack, reaching a peak 3 h after wounding and 6 h after insect feeding. We produced transgenic rice lines carrying either sense or antisense constructs under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and these rice lines showed altered OsLOX1 activity. In all of the antisense lines and more than half of the sense lines the expression levels of OsLOX1, the levels of enzyme activity, and the levels of the endogenous OsLOX1 products (jasmonic acid, (Z)-3-hexenal and colneleic acid) at 6, 48, and 48 h after BPH feeding respectively, were below the levels found in non-transgenic control plants; yet, the levels in the remaining sense transformants were enhanced relative to controls. Transformants with a lower level of OsLOX1 expression were less able to tolerate BPH attack, while those with enhanced OsLOX1 expression were more resistant. Our data suggest that the OsLOX1 product is involved in tolerance of the rice plant to wounding and BPH attack.
18506478	Molecular cloning, functional characterization and expression analysis of a novel monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Planta	Monosaccharides transporters play important roles in assimilate supply for sink tissue development. In this study, a new monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST6 was identified from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The predicted OsMST6 protein shows typical features of sugar transporters and shares 79.6% identity with the rice monosaccharide transporter OsMST3. Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) demonstrated that OsMST6 is a broad-spectrum monosaccharide transporter, with a K (m) of 266.1 muMu for glucose. OsMST6-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane in plant. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis exhibited that OsMST6 is expressed in all tested organs/tissues. In developing seeds, OsMST6 expression level is high at the early and middle grain filling stages and gradually declines later. Further analysis detected its expression in both maternal and filial tissues. RNA in situ hybridization analysis indicated that OsMST6 is predominantly expressed in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm of young seeds, in mesophyll cells of source leaf blades, and in pollens and the connective vein of anthers. In addition, OsMST6 expression is up-regulated by salt stress and sugars. The physiological role of OsMST6 for seed development and its roles in other sink and source tissues are discussed.
17874189	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Monosaccharide transporters mediate the membrane transport of a variable range of monosaccharides, which plays a crucial role in sugar distribution throughout the plant. To investigate the significance of monosaccharide transporters for rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed development, cDNA of a new putative monosaccharide transporter gene OsMST4 was isolated. The deduced OsMST4 protein shows typical features of monosaccharide transporters, and shares high homology with other plant homologues. Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that OsMST4 is a functional monosaccharide transporter capable of transporting glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose. Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsMST4 is expressed in all tested organs/tissues. In developing caryopses, its expression is high at the early and middle grain filling stages, and declines gradually to low levels after that. Further analysis revealed that it is expressed in both the maternal tissue and the filial tissue, with its highest expression in embryo. Cellular location in young caryopses through RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsMST4 mRNA mainly accumulates in the vascular parenchyma of the chalazal vein, cross-cells, nucellar tissue and endosperm. The expression pattern of OsMST4 was further confirmed by histochemical analysis of the OsMST4-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice plants. These data indicate that OsMST4 is actively involved in monosaccharides supply for seed development during the course of grain filling. In addition, the cell type-specific expression patterns of OsMST4 in other sink and source tissues were also investigated, and its corresponding physiological roles were discussed.
2884170	Nucleotide sequence of the rice cytochrome f gene and the presence of sequence variation near this gene.	1986	Gene	The rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Labelle) chloroplast (cp) gene encoding cytochrome f has been isolated and sequenced. The coding region of this rice gene displays 95.1%, 85.3% and 85.2% nucleotide sequence homology with that of wheat, pea and spinach, respectively. To examine the cpDNA sequence variation in rice, cpDNA from Labelle and its parents, Belle Patna and Dawn was compared. Using the cytochrome f gene as the probe for hybridization, we found several differences in the size and number of restriction fragments in the cp genome of three rice varieties. An additional restriction fragment found in the Belle Patna cp suggests that this cp genome is either heterogeneous or contains two copies of cytochrome f gene per cpDNA.
17535821	A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis.	2007	Plant Physiol	Chlorophyll (Chl) synthase catalyzes esterification of chlorophyllide to complete the last step of Chl biosynthesis. Although the Chl synthases and the corresponding genes from various organisms have been well characterized, Chl synthase mutants have not yet been reported in higher plants. In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl-deficient mutant, yellow-green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow-green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of ygl1 was caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. The ygl1 locus was mapped to chromosome 5 and isolated by map-based cloning. Sequence analysis revealed that it encodes the Chl synthase and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation. A missense mutation was found in a highly conserved residue of YGL1 in the ygl1 mutant, resulting in reduction of the enzymatic activity. YGL1 is constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression is not significantly affected in the ygl1 mutant. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of the cab1R gene encoding the Chl a/b-binding protein was severely suppressed in the ygl1 mutant. Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings. These results indicate that the expression of nuclear genes encoding various chloroplast proteins might be feedback regulated by the level of Chl or Chl precursors.
17426956	Over-expression of a LEA gene in rice improves drought resistance under the field conditions.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been implicated in many stress responses of plants. In this report, a LEA protein gene OsLEA3-1 was identified and over-expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the field conditions. OsLEA3-1 is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress. The promoter of OsLEA3-1 isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought- and salt-stress conditions. Three expression constructs consisting of the full-length cDNA driven by the drought-inducible promoter of OsLEA3-1 (OsLEA3-H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3-S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3-A) were transformed into the drought-sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11. Drought resistance pre-screening of T(1) families at anthesis stage revealed that the over-expressing families with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs had significantly higher relative yield (yield under drought stress treatment/yield under normal growth conditions) than the wild type under drought stress conditions, although a yield penalty existed in T(1) families under normal growth conditions. Nine homozygous families, exhibiting over-expression of a single-copy of the transgene and relatively low yield penalty in the T(1) generation, were tested in the field for drought resistance in the T(2) and T(3) generations and in the PVC pipes for drought tolerance in the T(2) generation. Except for two families (transformed with OsLEA3-A), all the other families (transformed with OsLEA3-S and OsLEA3-H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the field and the PVC pipes conditions. No significant yield penalty was detected for these T(2 )and T(3) families. These results indicate that transgenic rice with significantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over-expressing OsLEA3-1 gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non-stress) in-field screening protocol.
18325341	Overexpression of a TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	FEBS Lett	We previously identified a salt and drought stress-responsive TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 from rice. Here we report the functional analysis of ZFP252 using gain- and loss-of-function strategies. We found that overexpression of ZFP252 in rice increased the amount of free proline and soluble sugars, elevated the expression of stress defense genes and enhanced rice tolerance to salt and drought stresses, as compared with ZFP252 antisense and non-transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that ZFP252 plays an important role in rice response to salt and drought stresses and is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses.
18454147	Natural variation in Ghd7 is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice.	2008	Nat Genet	Yield potential, plant height and heading date are three classes of traits that determine the productivity of many crop plants. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) Ghd7, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date. Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size. Natural mutants with reduced function enable rice to be cultivated in temperate and cooler regions. Thus, Ghd7 has played crucial roles for increasing productivity and adaptability of rice globally.
18487352	Mutation of a rice gene encoding a phenylalanine biosynthetic enzyme results in accumulation of phenylalanine and tryptophan.	2008	Plant Cell	Two distinct biosynthetic pathways for Phe in plants have been proposed: conversion of prephenate to Phe via phenylpyruvate or arogenate. The reactions catalyzed by prephenate dehydratase (PDT) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT) contribute to these respective pathways. The Mtr1 mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) manifests accumulation of Phe, Trp, and several phenylpropanoids, suggesting a link between the synthesis of Phe and Trp. Here, we show that the Mtr1 mutant gene (mtr1-D) encodes a form of rice PDT with a point mutation in the putative allosteric regulatory region of the protein. Transformed callus lines expressing mtr1-D exhibited all the characteristics of Mtr1 callus tissue. Biochemical analysis revealed that rice PDT possesses both PDT and ADT activities, with a preference for arogenate as substrate, suggesting that it functions primarily as an ADT. The wild-type enzyme is feedback regulated by Phe, whereas the mutant enzyme showed a reduced feedback sensitivity, resulting in Phe accumulation. In addition, these observations indicate that rice PDT is critical for regulating the size of the Phe pool in plant cells. Feeding external Phe to wild-type callus tissue and seedlings resulted in Trp accumulation, demonstrating a connection between Phe accumulation and Trp pool size.
18515498	A transporter regulating silicon distribution in rice shoots.	2008	Plant Cell	Rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates very high concentrations of silicon (Si) in the shoots, and the deposition of Si as amorphous silica helps plants to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we describe a transporter, Lsi6, which is involved in the distribution of Si in the shoots. Lsi6 belongs to the nodulin-26 intrinsic protein III subgroup of aquaporins and is permeable to silicic acid. Lsi6 is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips. Cellular localization studies revealed that Lsi6 is found in the xylem parenchyma cells of the leaf sheath and leaf blades. Moreover, Lsi6 showed polar localization at the side facing toward the vessel. Knockdown of Lsi6 did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid. These results indicate that Lsi6 is a transporter responsible for the transport of Si out of the xylem and subsequently affects the distribution of Si in the leaf.
17895582	Biochemical and biological properties of DNA photolyases derived from utraviolet-sensitive rice cultivars.	2007	Genes Genet Syst	Class I and class II CPD photolyases are enzymes which repair pyrimidine dimers using visible light. A detailed characterization of class I CPD photolyases has been carried out, but little is known about the class II enzymes. Photolyases from rice are suitable for functional analyses because systematic breeding for long periods in Asian countries has led to the selection of naturally occurring mutations in the CPD photolyase gene. We report the biochemical characterization of rice mutant CPD photolyases purified as GST-form from Escherichia coli. We identified three amino acid changes, Gln126Arg, Gly255Ser, and Gln296His, among which Gln but not His at 296 is important for complementing phr-defective E. coli, binding UV-damage in E. coli, and binding thymine dimers in vitro. The photolyase with Gln at 296 has an apoenzyme:FAD ratio of 1 : 0.5 and that with His at 296 has an apoenzyme:FAD ratio of 1 : 0.12-0.25, showing a role for Gln at 296 in the binding of FAD not in the binding of thymine dimer. Concerning Gln or Arg at 126, the biochemical activity of the photolyases purified from E. coli and complementing activity for phr-defective E. coli are similarly proficient. However, the sensitivity to UV of cultivars differs depending on whether Gln or Arg is at 126. The role of Gln and Arg at 126 for photoreactivation in rice is discussed.
17578919	Transposition of the rice miniature inverted repeat transposable element mPing in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	An active miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE), mPing, was discovered by computer-assisted analysis of rice genome sequence. The mPing element is mobile in rice cell culture and in a few rice strains where it has been amplified to >1,000 copies during recent domestication. However, determination of the transposase source and characterization of the mechanism of transposition have been hampered by the high copy number of mPing and the presence of several candidate autonomous elements in the rice genome. Here, we report that mPing is active in Arabidopsis thaliana, where its transposition is catalyzed by three sources of transposase from rice: the autonomous Ping and Pong elements and by a cDNA derived from a Ping transcript. In addition to transposase, the product of a second element-encoded ORF of unknown function is also required for mPing transposition. Excision of mPing in A. thaliana is usually precise, and transposed copies usually insert into unlinked sites in the genome that are preferentially in or near genes. As such, this will be a valuable assay system for the dissection of MITE transposition and a potentially powerful tagging system for gene discovery in eukaryotes.
17932646	Genetic variation of NBS-LRR class resistance genes in rice lines.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The use of plant disease resistance (R) genes in breeding programs needs an understanding of their variation patterns. In our current study, we investigated the polymorphisms of 44 NBS-LRR class R-genes among 21 rice cultivars and 14 wild rice populations. Our data suggested that there were four basic types of variations: conserved, diversified, intermediate-diversified, and present/absent patterns. Common characteristics at a locus of conserved R-genes were: copy-number uniformity, clear divergence (long branches) with other paralogs, and highly identical alleles. On the other hand, copy-number variability, a nearly equal and non-zero branch lengths, and high levels of nucleotide diversity were observed at the loci of highly diversified R-genes. Research suggests that the ratio of diverse alleles to the total number of genes at a locus is one of the best criteria to characterize the variation pattern of an R-gene. Our data suggested that a significant genetic reduction was detected only in four present/absent R-genes, compared with the variation observed in wild rice. In general, no difference was detected between wild rice and cultivars, japonica and indica rice, or between lines from different geographic regions. Our results also suggested that R-genes were under strong selection, which shaped R-gene variation patterns.
17716996	Disease resistance against Magnaporthe grisea is enhanced in transgenic rice with suppression of omega-3 fatty acid desaturases.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Linolenic acid (18:3) is the most abundant fatty acid in plant membrane lipids and is a source for various oxidized metabolites, called oxylipins. 18:3 and oxylipins play important roles in the induction of defense responses to pathogen infection and wound stress in Arabidopsis. However, in rice, endogenous roles for 18:3 and oxylipins in disease resistance have not been confirmed. We generated 18:3-deficient transgenic rice plants (F78Ri) with co-suppression of two omega-3 fatty acid desaturases, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8. that synthesize 18:3. The F78Ri plants showed enhanced resistance to the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea. A typical 18:3-derived oxylipin, jasmonic acid (JA), acts as a signaling molecule in defense responses to fungal infection in Arabidopsis. However, in F78Ri plants, the expression of JA-responsive pathogenesis-related genes, PBZ1 and PR1b, was induced after inoculation with M. grisea, although the JA-mediated wound response was suppressed. Furthermore, the application of JA methyl ester had no significant effect on the enhanced resistance in F78Ri plants. Taken together, our results indicate that, although suppression of fatty acid desaturases involves the concerted action of varied oxylipins via diverse metabolic pathways, 18:3 or 18:3-derived oxylipins, except for JA, may contribute to signaling on defense responses of rice to M. grisea infection.
17541629	Mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 negatively regulates rice disease resistance to bacterial pathogens.	2007	Planta	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in diverse developmental and physiological processes of plants, including pathogen-induced defense responses. Although at least 17 rice MAPKs have been identified and more than half of these MAPK genes have been shown to be pathogen or elicitor responsive, the exact role of most of the MAPKs in host-pathogen interaction is unknown. Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance. Suppressing OsMPK6 or knocking out of OsMPK6 enhanced rice resistance to different races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning in the NH1 (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)-involved defense signal transduction pathway. These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion.
18258694	Characteristic and expression analysis of a metallothionein gene, OsMT2b, down-regulated by cytokinin suggests functions in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.	2008	Plant Physiol	Metallothioneins (MTs) are low molecular mass and cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins known to be mainly involved in maintaining metal homeostasis and stress responses. But, their functions in higher plant development are scarcely studied. Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) METALLOTHIONEIN2b (OsMT2b) molecularly and found that its expression was down-regulated by cytokinins. OsMT2b was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots. In contrast with wild-type plants, OsMT2b-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas OsMT2b-overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots. The increased cytokinin levels in RNAi plants and decreased cytokinin levels in overexpressing plants were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography quantitative analysis in the roots of wild-type and transgenic plants. In RNAi plants, localization of isopentenyladenosine, a kind of endogenous cytokinin, in roots and germinating embryos expanded to the whole tissues, whereas in overexpressing plants, the isopentenyladenosine signals were very faint in the vascular tissues of roots and scutellum cells of germinating embryos. In vitro culture of embryos could largely resume the reduced germination frequency in RNAi plants but had no obvious change in overexpressing plants. Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of OsMT2b to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.
15685292	The Genomes of Oryza sativa: a history of duplications.	2005	PLoS Biol	We report improved whole-genome shotgun sequences for the genomes of indica and japonica rice, both with multimegabase contiguity, or almost 1,000-fold improvement over the drafts of 2002. Tested against a nonredundant collection of 19,079 full-length cDNAs, 97.7% of the genes are aligned, without fragmentation, to the mapped super-scaffolds of one or the other genome. We introduce a gene identification procedure for plants that does not rely on similarity to known genes to remove erroneous predictions resulting from transposable elements. Using the available EST data to adjust for residual errors in the predictions, the estimated gene count is at least 38,000-40,000. Only 2%-3% of the genes are unique to any one subspecies, comparable to the amount of sequence that might still be missing. Despite this lack of variation in gene content, there is enormous variation in the intergenic regions. At least a quarter of the two sequences could not be aligned, and where they could be aligned, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates varied from as little as 3.0 SNP/kb in the coding regions to 27.6 SNP/kb in the transposable elements. A more inclusive new approach for analyzing duplication history is introduced here. It reveals an ancient whole-genome duplication, a recent segmental duplication on Chromosomes 11 and 12, and massive ongoing individual gene duplications. We find 18 distinct pairs of duplicated segments that cover 65.7% of the genome; 17 of these pairs date back to a common time before the divergence of the grasses. More important, ongoing individual gene duplications provide a never-ending source of raw material for gene genesis and are major contributors to the differences between members of the grass family.
12602862	Two genes encoding protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits are differentially expressed in rice.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	Type 2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2A) plays a variety of regulatory roles in metabolism and signal transduction. Two closely related PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) genes, OsPP2A-1 and OsPP2A-3, have been isolated from the monocot Oryza sativa. Both genes contain six exons and five introns which intervene at identical locations, suggesting they have descended from a recent duplication event. Their encoded proteins share 97% sequence identity and are highly similar (94-96%) to a PP2Ac subfamily (AtPP2A-1, -2 and -5) identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Both OsPP2A-1 and OsPP2A-3 are ubiquitously expressed, with the expression levels high in stems and flowers and low in leaves. OsPP2A-1, but not OsPP2A-3, is also highly expressed in roots. Transcript levels of OsPP2A-1 in roots and OsPP2A-3 in stems are elevated at the maturation and young stages, respectively. Drought and high salinity upregulate both genes in leaves, whereas heat stress represses OsPP2A-1 in stems and induces OsPP2A-3 in all organs. These findings indicate that the two PP2Ac genes are subjected to developmental and stress-related regulation. In situ hybridization results show that both transcripts exhibit nearly identical cellular distribution, except in leaves, and are abundant in meristematic tissues including the young leaf blade of stems and the root tip.
8790296	A promiscuous chloroplast DNA fragment is transcribed in plant mitochondria but the encoded RNA is not edited.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The RNA editing processes in chloroplasts and mitochondira of higher plants show several similarities which are suggestive of common components and/or biochemical steps between the two plant organelles. The existence of various promiscuous DNA fragments of chloroplast origin in plant mitochondrial genomes allowed us to test the possibility that chloroplast sequences are also edited in mitochondria. An rpoB fragment transferred from chloroplasts to mitochondria in rice was chosen as it contains several editing sites, two of which match sequence motifs surrounding even non-homologous editing sites in both chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts. Rice chloroplast and mitochondrial rpoB DNA and cDNA sequences were selectively amplified and the editing status of the cDNA sequences was determined. Three of the four potential rpoB editing sites previously detected in maize were found to be edited in the rice chloroplast rpoB transcript, whereas the fourth was found to remain unedited. In mitochondria, however, all four editing sites remain unmodified at the cDNA level. This indicates that the editing processes of higher plant mitochondria and chloroplasts are not identical and that organelle-specific factors are required for eliciting the respective editing events.
17182895	Multilocus analysis of nucleotide variation and speciation in Oryza officinalis and its close relatives.	2007	Mol Biol Evol	Nucleotide variation in 10 unlinked nuclear genes was investigated in species-wide samples of Oryza officinalis and its close relatives (Oryza eichingeri and Oryza rhizomatis). Average estimates of nucleotide diversity were the lowest in O. rhizomatis ((sil) = 0.0038) and the highest in O. eichingeri ((sil) = 0.0057) that is disjunctly distributed in Africa and Sri Lanka. These wild rice species appeared to harbor relatively low levels of nucleotide variation relative to other plant species because the diversity level of O. eichingeri is only 23-46% of those in Zea species and 35% of that in Arabidopsis thaliana. The lower nucleotide diversity in these Oryza species could be best explained by their smaller historic effective population sizes. The speciation model test indicated that O. officinalis and its close relatives might have undergone a process of population contraction since divergence from their ancestor. Incongruent topologies among 10 gene trees, particularly regarding the positions of O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis accessions might be attributed to lineage sorting arising from ancient polymorphism and hybridization/introgression between the Sri Lankan O. eichingeri and O. rhizomatis. However, the null hypothesis of the isolation model was not rejected for any contrast between taxa, which suggested that no subsequent gene flow shaped the present patterns of nucleotide variation since their divergence and that introgression was not pervasive in this group of species. Our molecular dating provides an approximate divergence time of 0.37 Myr between 2 geographical races of O. eichingeri, much more recent compared with the times of other speciation events in this group (0.63-0.68 Myr). A long-distance dispersal from West Africa to Sri Lanka was more likely to play a role in the disjunct distribution of O. eichingeri.
17534720	New insights into Oryza genome evolution: high gene colinearity and differential retrotransposon amplification.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	An approximately 247-kb genomic region from FF genome of wild rice Oryza brachyantha, possessing the smallest Oryza genome, was compared to the orthologous approximately 450-kb region from AA genome, O. sativa L. ssp. japonica. 37 of 38 genes in the orthologous regions are shared between japonica and O. brachyantha. Analyses of nucleotide substitution in coding regions suggest the two genomes diverged approximately 10 million years ago. Comparisons of transposable elements (TEs) reveal that the density of DNA TEs in O. brachyantha is comparable to O. sativa; however, the density of RNA TEs is dramatically lower. The genomic fraction of RNA TEs in japonica is two times greater than in O. brachyantha. Differences, particularly in RNA TEs, in this region and in BAC end sequences from five wild and two cultivated Oryza species explain major genome size differences between sativa and brachyantha. Gene expression analyses of three ObDREB1 genes in the sequenced region indicate orthologous genes retain similar expression patterns following cold stress. Our results demonstrate that size and number of RNA TEs play a major role in genomic differentiation and evolution in Oryza. Additionally, distantly related O. brachyantha shares colinearity with O. sativa, offering opportunities to use comparative genomics to explore the genetic diversity of wild species to improve cultivated rice.
18162595	Structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses suggest that indole-3-acetic acid methyltransferase is an evolutionarily ancient member of the SABATH family.	2008	Plant Physiol	The plant SABATH protein family encompasses a group of related small-molecule methyltransferases (MTs) that catalyze the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation of natural chemicals encompassing widely divergent structures. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) methyltransferase (IAMT) is a member of the SABATH family that modulates IAA homeostasis in plant tissues through methylation of IAA's free carboxyl group. The crystal structure of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) IAMT (AtIAMT1) was determined and refined to 2.75 A resolution. The overall tertiary and quaternary structures closely resemble the two-domain bilobed monomer and the dimeric arrangement, respectively, previously observed for the related salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase from Clarkia breweri (CbSAMT). To further our understanding of the biological function and evolution of SABATHs, especially of IAMT, we analyzed the SABATH gene family in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Forty-one OsSABATH genes were identified. Expression analysis showed that more than one-half of the OsSABATH genes were transcribed in one or multiple organs. The OsSABATH gene most similar to AtIAMT1 is OsSABATH4. Escherichia coli-expressed OsSABATH4 protein displayed the highest level of catalytic activity toward IAA and was therefore named OsIAMT1. OsIAMT1 exhibited kinetic properties similar to AtIAMT1 and poplar IAMT (PtIAMT1). Structural modeling of OsIAMT1 and PtIAMT1 using the experimentally determined structure of AtIAMT1 reported here as a template revealed conserved structural features of IAMTs within the active-site cavity that are divergent from functionally distinct members of the SABATH family, such as CbSAMT. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that IAMTs from Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar (Populus spp.) form a monophyletic group. Thus, structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic evidence supports the hypothesis that IAMT is an evolutionarily ancient member of the SABATH family likely to play a critical role in IAA homeostasis across a wide range of plants.
17249423	The genomic dynamics and evolutionary mechanism of the Pi2/9 locus in rice.	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The Pi2/9 locus contains at least four resistance specificities to Magnaporthe grisea and belongs to a gene complex comprised of multiple genes that encode highly homologous nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) proteins. To investigate the genetic events involved in the evolution of the Pi2/9 locus, we analyzed the Pi2/9 locus at the inter- and intralocus levels in five rice cultivars. The NBS-LRR genes in the five cultivars belong to the same phylogenetic clade among rice NBS-LRR genes, and all have a phase-2 intron at the N-terminus. However, the paralogs within each haplotype show a significant sequence divergence and their N-terminal intron and 5' regulatory regions are very different. On the contrary, the orthologs from different haplotypes are highly similar, indicating an obvious orthologous relationship has been maintained during the evolution of the Pi2/9 locus. These results suggest that sequence diversification in the 5' regulatory regions and N-terminal introns of the paralogs may have led to suppression of meiotic recombination between the paralogs within each haplotype, facilitating the maintenance of the orthologous relationship among rice cultivars. Our observations provide valuable insight into the genomic dynamics and evolutionary mechanism of an NBS-LRR resistance-gene complex in rice.
17218640	Multilocus analysis of nucleotide variation of Oryza sativa and its wild relatives: severe bottleneck during domestication of rice.	2007	Mol Biol Evol	Varying degrees of reduction of genetic diversity in crops relative to their wild progenitors occurred during the process of domestication. Such information, however, has not been available for the Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) despite its importance as a staple food and a model organism. To reveal levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity and to elucidate the genetic relationship and demographic history of O. sativa and its close relatives (Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara), we investigated nucleotide diversity data from 10 unlinked nuclear loci in species-wide samples of these species. The results indicated that O. rufipogon and O. nivara possessed comparable levels of nucleotide variation ((sil) = 0.0077 approximately 0.0095) compared with the relatives of other crops. In contrast, nucleotide diversity of O. sativa was as low as (sil) = 0.0024 and even lower ((sil) = 0.0021 for indica and 0.0011 for japonica), if we consider the 2 subspecies separately. Overall, only 20-10% of the diversity in the wild species was retained in 2 subspecies of the cultivated rice (indica and japonica), respectively. Because statistic tests did not reject the assumption of neutrality for all 10 loci, we further used coalescent to simulate bottlenecks under various lengths and population sizes to better understand the domestication process. Consistent with the dramatic reduction in nucleotide diversity, we detected a severe domestication bottleneck and demonstrated that the sequence diversity currently found in the rice genome could be explained by a founding population of 1,500 individuals if the initial domestication event occurred over a 3,000-year period. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close genetic relationships and ambiguous species boundary of O. rufipogon and O. nivara, providing additional evidence to treat them as 2 ecotypes of a single species. Lowest linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found in the perennial O. rufipogon where the r(2) value dropped to a negligible level within 400 bp, and the highest in the japonica rice where LD extended to the entirely sequenced region ( approximately 900 bp), implying that LD mapping by genome scans may not be feasible in wild rice due to the high density of markers needed.
17604002	Characterization of alternative splicing products of bZIP transcription factors OsABI5.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Alternative splicing allows many gene products to alter their biological functions. A bZIP-type transcription factor, OsABI5, undergoes alternative splicing. Two OsABI5 splicing variants were identified, designated OsABI5-1, and OsABI5-2 and their different expression patterns in tissues were analyzed. Despite a completely identical functional domain, OsABI5-2 could specifically bind to G-box element, but OsABI5-1 could not; the transactivation activity of OsABI5-1 was higher than that of OsABI5-2; the interaction strength of OsABI5-2 and OsVP1 was stronger than that of OsABI5-1 and OsVP1; indicating a different function in the regulation of downstream target genes. Complementation tests and ABA (abscisic acid) hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis transgenic lines revealed the redundant function of OsABI5 splicing variants in ABA signaling. The interaction between OsABI5-1 and OsABI5-2 was also confirmed. These results suggest that OsABI5 variants may have overlapping and distinct functions to fine tune gene expression in ABA signaling as transcription factors together with OsVP1.
18315873	Analysis of 142 genes resolves the rapid diversification of the rice genus.	2008	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: The completion of rice genome sequencing has made rice and its wild relatives an attractive system for biological studies. Despite great efforts, phylogenetic relationships among genome types and species in the rice genus have not been fully resolved. To take full advantage of rice genome resources for biological research and rice breeding, we will benefit from the availability of a robust phylogeny of the rice genus.

RESULTS: Through screening rice genome sequences, we sampled and sequenced 142 single-copy genes to clarify the relationships among all diploid genome types of the rice genus. The analysis identified two short internal branches around which most previous phylogenetic inconsistency emerged. These represent two episodes of rapid speciation that occurred approximately 5 and 10 million years ago (Mya) and gave rise to almost the entire diversity of the genus. The known chromosomal distribution of the sampled genes allowed the documentation of whole-genome sorting of ancestral alleles during the rapid speciation, which was responsible primarily for extensive incongruence between gene phylogenies and persisting phylogenetic ambiguity in the genus. Random sample analysis showed that 120 genes with an average length of 874 bp were needed to resolve both short branches with 95% confidence.

CONCLUSION: Our phylogenomic analysis successfully resolved the phylogeny of rice genome types, which lays a solid foundation for comparative and functional genomic studies of rice and its relatives. This study also highlights that organismal genomes might be mosaics of conflicting genealogies because of rapid speciation and demonstrates the power of phylogenomics in the reconstruction of rapid diversification.
17022630	Differential expression of defense/stress-related marker proteins in leaves of a unique rice blast lesion mimic mutant (blm).	2006	J Proteome Res	We analyzed a unique rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast lesion mimic (blm) mutant for differentially expressed proteins in leaves of one- and two-week-old seedlings manifesting the lesion mimic phenotype. Gel-based one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis (1- and 2-DGE) was performed using leaves (blm and wild-type, WT) before (stage 1, S1) and after (stage 2, S2) lesion formation. 1-DGE immunoblotting revealed potent increase in the expression of a key pathogenesis-related (PR) marker biosynthetic enzyme, naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase, involved in rice phytoalexin sakuranetin biosynthesis, and three oxidative-stress-related marker proteins, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in leaves of the blm mutant. 2-D gel immunoblotting analysis with anti-APX and anti-SOD antibodies revealed newly appearing cross-reacting protein spots in blm. 2-DGE analysis detected 50 Coomassie brilliant blue-stained protein spots differentially expressed in blm. A total of 23 and 44 protein spots was excised for analysis by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and nano-electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively; 26 nonredundant proteins were identified. The pathogenesis-related class 5 and 10 proteins, including a new OsPR10d protein, were significantly induced in blm. The OsPR5 protein spot was stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain suggesting OsPR5 to be a putative phosphoprotein. Surprisingly, protein spot 20, a leaf OsPR10b, showed identity to a rice root-specific PR-10 (RSOsPR10). To resolve this discrepancy, we checked its expression in leaves of blm and WT (S1 and S2), respectively, using gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RSOsPR10 mRNA was found to express in the leaves.
15659436	Suppression of tiller bud activity in tillering dwarf mutants of rice.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	In this study, we analyzed five tillering dwarf mutants that exhibit reduction of plant stature and an increase in tiller numbers. We show that, in the mutants, axillary meristems are normally established but the suppression of tiller bud activity is weakened. The phenotypes of tillering dwarf mutants suggest that they play roles in the control of tiller bud dormancy to suppress bud activity. However, tillering dwarf mutants show the dependence of both node position and planting density on their growth, which implies that the functions of tillering dwarf genes are independent of the developmental and environmental control of bud activity. Map-based cloning of the D3 gene revealed that it encodes an F-box leucine-trich repeat (LRR) protein orthologous to Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9. This indicates the conservation of mechanisms controlling axillary bud activity between monocots and eudicots. We suggest that tillering dwarf mutants are suitable for the study of bud activity control in rice and believe that future molecular and genetic studies using them may enable significant progress in understanding the control of tillering and shoot branching.
16010732	OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis.	2005	Plant Cell Environ	Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) proteins, which mediate vesicular transport, have little or no intrinsic GTPase activity. They rely on the action of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for their function. In the present study the OsAGAP gene in rice, which encoded a protein with predicted structure similar to ArfGAP, was identified. The purified OsAGAP-GST fusion protein was able to stimulate the GTPase activity of rice Arf. Furthermore, OsAGAP can rescue the defect of vesicular transport in the yeast gcs1 delta glo3 delta double-mutant cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis with OsAGAP constitutively expression showed reduced apical dominance, shorter primary roots, increasing number of longer adventitious roots. Many of the phenotypes can be phenocopied by treatment of exogenous indoleacetic acid level (IAA) in wild-type plants. Determination of whole-plant IAA level showed that there is a sharp increase of free IAA in OsAGAP transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings. In addition, removal of the 4-day-old shoot apex could inhibit the adventitious root formation in the transgenic seedlings. These results suggest OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP of rice, maybe involved in the mediation of plant root development by regulating auxin level.
17369428	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism.	2007	Plant Physiol	Gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis is regulated by feedback control providing a mechanism for GA homeostasis in plants. However, regulatory elements involved in the feedback control are not known. In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2. Overexpression of YAB1 in transgenic rice resulted in a semidwarf phenotype that could be fully rescued by applied GA. Quantification of the endogenous GA content revealed increases of GA(20) and decreases of GA(1) levels in the overexpression plants, in which the transcripts of the biosynthetic gene GA3ox2 were decreased. Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2. The repression of GA3ox2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion. Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter. In addition, the expression of YAB1 was deregulated in GA biosynthesis and signaling mutants and could be either transiently induced by GA or repressed by a GA inhibitor. Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA3ox2. These data together suggest that YAB1 is involved in the feedback regulation of GA biosynthesis in rice.
15759867	[Molecular mapping of two semidwarf genes in an indica rice variety Aitaiyin3 (Oryza sativa L.)].	2005	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	The rice dwarf variety Aitaiyin3 is derived from a semidwarf cultivar Taiyin1. Genetic analysis indicated that the dwarf phenotype in Aitaiyin3 is involved in two recessive loci. Using bulk analysis with SSR markers, the two loci were located on the chromosome 1 and chromosome 4, respectively. Moreover, the allelism test showed that the locus on the chromosome 1 is allelic to the semidwarf gene sd1, while the other one is a new locus, here was named as sdt2. Further molecular mapping showed that sd1 was linked with SSR markers in the order of RM297-RM302-RM212-OSR3-sd1 with genetic distances of 4.7 cM, 0 cM, 0.8 cM and 0 cM, respectively. The linkage relationship of sdt2 with five SSR markers was SSR332-RM1305-sdt2-RM5633-RM307-RM401 with genetic distances of 11.6 cM, 3.8 cM, 0.4 cM, 0 cM and 0.4 cM, respectively.
11209709	[Chromosome location of a semidwarf gene sd-t in indica rice (O. sativa L.)].	2001	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	For investigating the linkage group to which the semidwarf gene sd-t belongs, the crosses between Aitaiyin 2(ATY2), a variety of sd-t carrier in indica rice, and marker stocks as well as the trisomic lines of IR36 were made. The results indicated that the sd-t gene was linked to the marker genes Prp-b (Purple pericap b), lg(ligueless) and Wh(White hull). The recombination values estimated were 2.85% +/- 0.52% for sd-t to Prp-b, 27.90% +/- 3.81% for sd-t to lg and 38.62% +/- 2.99% for sd-t to Wh, respectively. It was inferred that the sd-t gene was located on chromosome 4 according to the established relationship between chromosomes and linkage groups.
17579813	Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of Wxb pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Starch is the major component of cereal grains. In rice, starch properties determine the eating and cooking quality. The dull endosperm of rice grains is a classical morphological and agronomical trait that has long been exploited for breeding and genetics study. To understand the molecular mechanism that regulates the starch biosynthesis in rice grains, we characterized a classic rice mutant dull endosperm1 (du1) and isolated Du1 through a map-based cloning approach. Du1, encoding a member of pre-mRNA processing (Prp1) family, is expressed mainly in panicles. Du1 specifically affects the splicing efficiency of Wx(b) and regulates starch biosynthesis by mediating the expression of starch biosynthesis genes. Analysis of du1wx shows that Du1 acts upstream of Wx(b). These results strongly suggest that Du1 may function as a regulator of the starch biosynthesis by affecting the splicing of Wx(b) and the expression of other genes involved in the rice starch biosynthetic pathways.
16289628	Cloning and characterization of wheat PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) homoeologous genes and promoter sequences.	2006	Gene	The genomic and cDNA sequences of three PDI homoeologous genes located on chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D of bread wheat and their promoters were cloned and sequenced. The three sequences showed a very high conservation of the coding region and of the exon/intron structure, which consisted of ten exons. The comparison of wheat sequences with those of rice and Arabidopsis showed a significant conservation of the exon/intron structure across the three species. The expression of each gene was analysed by RT-PCR in different plant tissues (roots, coleoptiles, spikelets, leaves and developing caryopses). All the genes showed a higher expression in developing caryopses than in other analysed tissues, wherein some differences were detected. The promoter sequences of the three genes possessed some regulatory motifs typical of endosperm specific expression.
16364243	Heritable alteration in DNA methylation pattern occurred specifically at mobile elements in rice plants following hydrostatic pressurization.	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Intrinsic DNA methylation pattern is an integral component of the epigenetic network in many eukaryotes. Exploring the extent to which DNA methylation patterns can be altered under a specific condition is important for elucidating the biological functions of this epigenetic modification. This is of added significance in plants wherein the newly acquired methylation patterns can be inherited through organismal generations. We report here that DNA methylation patterns of mobile elements but not of cellular genes were specifically altered in rice plants following hydrostatic pressurization. This was evidenced by methylation-sensitive gel-blot analysis, which showed that 10 out of 10 studied low-copy transposons and retrotransposons manifested methylation alteration in at least one of the 8 randomly chosen pressure-treated plants, whereas none of the 16 studied low-copy cellular genes showed any change. Both gel-blotting and genome-wide fingerprinting indicated that the methylation alteration in mobile elements was not accompanied by a general genetic instability. Progeny analysis indicated retention of the altered methylation patterns in most progeny plants, underscoring early occurrence of the alterations, and their faithful epigenetic inheritance.
16369532	Genome-wide transcription analyses in rice using tiling microarrays.	2006	Nat Genet	Sequencing and computational annotation revealed several features, including high gene numbers, unusual composition of the predicted genes and a large number of genes lacking homology to known genes, that distinguish the rice (Oryza sativa) genome from that of other fully sequenced model species. We report here a full-genome transcription analysis of the indica rice subspecies using high-density oligonucleotide tiling microarrays. Our results provided expression data support for the existence of 35,970 (81.9%) annotated gene models and identified 5,464 unique transcribed intergenic regions that share similar compositional properties with the annotated exons and have significant homology to other plant proteins. Elucidating and mapping of all transcribed regions revealed an association between global transcription and cytological chromosome features, and an overall similarity of transcriptional activity between duplicated segments of the genome. Collectively, our results provide the first whole-genome transcription map useful for further understanding the rice genome.
16380417	Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, is an effector of small GTPase Rac in defense signaling in rice.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	OsRac1, one of the Rac/Rop family of small GTPases, plays important roles in defense responses, including a role in the production of reactive oxygen species mediated by NADPH oxidase. We have identified an effector of OsRac1, namely rice (Oryza sativa) cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (OsCCR1), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis. Lignin, which is polymerized through peroxidase activity by using H(2)O(2) in the cell wall, is an important factor in plant defense responses, because it presents an undegradable mechanical barrier to most pathogens. Expression of OsCCR1 was induced by a sphingolipid elicitor, suggesting that OsCCR1 participates in defense signaling. In in vitro interaction and two-hybrid experiments, OsRac1 was shown to bind OsCCR1 in a GTP-dependent manner. Moreover, the interaction of OsCCR1 with OsRac1 led to the enzymatic activation of OsCCR1 in vitro. Transgenic cell cultures expressing the constitutively active OsRac1 accumulated lignin through enhanced CCR activity and increased reactive oxygen species production. Thus, it is likely that OsRac1 controls lignin synthesis through regulation of both NADPH oxidase and OsCCR1 activities during defense responses in rice.
16381819	Recombination, rearrangement, reshuffling, and divergence in a centromeric region of rice.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Centromeres have many unusual biological properties, including kinetochore attachment and severe repression of local meiotic recombination. These properties are partly an outcome, partly a cause, of unusual DNA structure in the centromeric region. Although several plant and animal genomes have been sequenced, most centromere sequences have not been completed or analyzed in depth. To shed light on the unique organization, variability, and evolution of centromeric DNA, detailed analysis of a 1.97-Mb sequence that includes centromere 8 (CEN8) of japonica rice was undertaken. Thirty-three long-terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon families (including 11 previously unknown) were identified in the CEN8 region, totaling 245 elements and fragments that account for 67% of the region. The ratio of solo LTRs to intact elements in the CEN8 region is approximately 0.9:1, compared with approximately 2.2:1 in noncentromeric regions of rice. However, the ratio of solo LTRs to intact elements in the core of the CEN8 region ( approximately 2.5:1) is higher than in any other region investigated in rice, suggesting a hotspot for unequal recombination. Comparison of the CEN8 region of japonica and its orthologous segments from indica rice indicated that approximately 15% of the intact retrotransposons and solo LTRs were inserted into CEN8 after the divergence of japonica and indica from a common ancestor, compared with approximately 50% for previously studied euchromatic regions. Frequent DNA rearrangements were observed in the CEN8 region, including a 212-kb subregion that was found to be composed of three rearranged tandem repeats. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed recent segmental duplication and extensive rearrangement and reshuffling of the CentO satellite repeats.

16467140	Buffering of crucial functions by paleologous duplicated genes may contribute cyclicality to angiosperm genome duplication.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Genome duplication followed by massive gene loss has permanently shaped the genomes of many higher eukaryotes, particularly angiosperms. It has long been believed that a primary advantage of genome duplication is the opportunity for the evolution of genes with new functions by modification of duplicated genes. If so, then patterns of genetic diversity among strains within taxa might reveal footprints of selection that are consistent with this advantage. Contrary to classical predictions that duplicated genes may be relatively free to acquire unique functionality, we find among both Arabidopsis ecotypes and Oryza subspecies that SNPs encode less radical amino acid changes in genes for which there exists a duplicated copy at a "paleologous" locus than in "singleton" genes. Preferential retention of duplicated genes encoding long complex proteins and their unexpectedly slow divergence (perhaps because of homogenization) suggest that a primary advantage of retaining duplicated paleologs may be the buffering of crucial functions. Functional buffering and functional divergence may represent extremes in the spectrum of duplicated gene fates. Functional buffering may be especially important during "genomic turmoil" immediately after genome duplication but continues to act approximately 60 million years later, and its gradual deterioration may contribute cyclicality to genome duplication in some lineages.
16473138	The telomerase inhibitor telomestatin induces telomere shortening and cell death in Arabidopsis.	2006	Biochim Biophys Acta	The cellular response to telomere dysfunction in plants was investigated with the use of telomestatin, an inhibitor of human telomerase activity. Telomestatin bound to plant telomeric repeat sequence, and inhibited telomerase activity in suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitor did not affect transcript level of the TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in the plant cells. Inhibition of telomerase activity by telomestatin resulted in rapid shortening of telomeres and the induction of cell death by an apoptosis-like mechanism in Arabidopsis cells. These results suggest that telomerase contributes to the survival of proliferating plant cells by maintaining telomere length, and that telomere erosion triggers cell death.
16483690	Ethanolic fermentation and anoxia tolerance in four rice cultivars.	2007	J Plant Physiol	The relationship between coleoptile elongation and ethanolic fermentation was investigated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) coleoptiles of four cultivars subjected to a 48-h anoxic stress. The coleoptile elongation of all cultivars was suppressed by anoxic stress; however, the elongation of cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare was much greater than that of cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi. The stress did not significantly increase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity or lactate concentration, but increased alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activities, as well as ethanol concentration in the coleoptiles of all cultivars. The elevated ADH and PDC activities and ethanol concentration in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare were much greater than those of cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi, suggesting that ethanolic fermentation is likely more active in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare than in cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi. ATP concentration in cvs Yukihikari and Nipponbare in anoxia was also greater than that in cvs Leulikelash and Asahimochi in anoxia. The ethanol concentration in the coleoptiles was correlated with anoxia tolerance with respect to the ATP concentration and coleoptile elongation. These results suggest that the ability to increase ethanolic fermentation may be one of the determinants in anoxia tolerance of rice coleoptiles.
16488558	The GH3 family in plants: genome wide analysis in rice and evolutionary history based on EST analysis.	2006	Gene	The GH3 gene family in Arabidopsis, implicated in hormonal homeostasis through the conjugation of indolacetic and jasmonic acids to amino acids, is involved in a broad range of plant growth and development processes. In this work, the analysis of the GH3 family in the genome of Oryza sativa identified 13 hypothetical ORFs. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that 12 of them were active genes. An extensive EST analysis of the GH3 family performed on 26 plant species was used to estimate the minimum number of GH3 genes en each one. The data indicated that the members of the GH3 family progressively increased in the different plant divisions from Chlorophyta (0), Bryophyta (3), and Coniferophyta (4), to Magnoliophyta (7-19). Phylogenetic analyses showed a high degree of conservation between Arabidopsis and rice GH3 proteins and, in general, in the plant kingdom. The data revealed a homology clustering consistent with the functional classification of the Arabidopsis proteins, since most of the 110 sequences analyzed grouped into 2 main clusters, corresponding to the Arabidopsis functional groups I (jasmonic acid adenylation) and II (indolacetic acid adenylation). And additional cluster including group III (non-adenylation ability) was exclusively composed of proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus and Gossypium hirsutum.
16500726	Alteration of oxidative and carbohydrate metabolism under abiotic stress in two rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes contrasting in chilling tolerance.	2007	J Plant Physiol	Abiotic stress is a major limiting factor in crop production. Physiological comparisons between contrasting abiotic stress-tolerant genotypes will improve understanding of stress-tolerant mechanisms. Rice seedlings (S3 stage) of a chilling-tolerant (CT) genotype (CT6748-8-CA-17) and a chilling-sensitive (CS) genotype (INIAP12) were subjected to abiotic stresses including chilling (13/12 degrees C), salt (100mM NaCl), and osmotic (200mM mannitol). Measures of physiological response to the stresses included changes in stress-related sugars, oxidative products and protective enzymes, parameters that could be used as possible markers for selection of improved tolerant varieties. Metabolite analyses showed that the two genotypes responded differently to different stresses. Genotype survival under chilling-stress was as expected, however, CT was more sensitive to salt stress than the CS genotype. The CT genotype was able to maintain membrane integrity better than CS, perhaps by reduction of lipid peroxidation via increased levels of antioxidant enzymes during chilling stress. This genotype accumulated sugars in response to stress, but the accumulation was usually less than in the CS genotype. Chill-stressed CT accumulated galactose and raffinose whereas these saccharides declined in CS. On the other hand, the tolerance mechanism in the more salt- and water-deficit-tolerant CS may be associated with accumulation of osmoprotectants such as glucose, trehalose and mannitol.
16537502	Gene evolution at the ends of wheat chromosomes.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Wheat ESTs mapped to deletion bins in the distal 42% of the long arm of chromosome 4B (4BL) were ordered in silico based on blastn homology against rice pseudochromosome 3. The ESTs spanned 29 cM on the short arm of rice chromosome 3, which is known to be syntenic to long arms of group-4 chromosomes of wheat. Fine-scale deletion-bin and genetic mapping revealed that 83% of ESTs were syntenic between wheat and rice, a far higher level of synteny than previously reported, and 6% were nonsyntenic (not located on rice chromosome 3). One inversion spanning a 5-cM region in rice and three deletion bins in wheat was identified. The remaining 11% of wheat ESTs showed no sequence homology in rice and mapped to the terminal 5% of the wheat chromosome 4BL. In this region, 27% of ESTs were duplicated, and it accounted for 70% of the recombination in the 4BL arm. Globally in wheat, no sequence homology ESTs mapped to the terminal bins, and ESTs rarely mapped to interstitial chromosomal regions known to be recombination hot spots. The wheat-rice comparative genomics analysis indicated that gene evolution occurs preferentially at the ends of chromosomes, driven by duplication and divergence associated with high rates of recombination.
16554820	A P-type ATPase required for rice blast disease and induction of host resistance.	2006	Nature	To cause diseases in plants, pathogenic microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to deliver proteins directly into plant cells, where they suppress plant defences and facilitate tissue invasion. How plant pathogenic fungi, which cause many of the world's most serious plant diseases, deliver proteins during plant infection is currently unknown. Here we report the characterization of a P-type ATPase-encoding gene, MgAPT2, in the economically important rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, which is required for exocytosis during plant infection. Targeted gene replacement showed that MgAPT2 is required for both foliar and root infection by the fungus, and for the rapid induction of host defence responses in an incompatible reaction. DeltaMgapt2 mutants are impaired in the secretion of a range of extracellular enzymes and accumulate abnormal Golgi-like cisternae. However, the loss of MgAPT2 does not significantly affect hyphal growth or sporulation, indicating that the establishment of rice blast disease involves the use of MgApt2-dependent exocytotic processes that operate during plant infection.
16632598	Genomewide comparative analysis of alternative splicing in plants.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Alternative splicing (AS) has been extensively studied in mammalian systems but much less in plants. Here we report AS events deduced from EST/cDNA analysis in two model plants: Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, 4,707 (21.8%) of the genes with EST/cDNA evidence show 8,264 AS events. Approximately 56% of these events are intron retention (IntronR), and only 8% are exon skipping. In rice, 6,568 (21.2%) of the expressed genes display 14,542 AS events, of which 53.5% are IntronR and 13.8% are exon skipping. The consistent high frequency of IntronR suggests prevalence of splice site recognition by intron definition in plants. Different AS events within a given gene occur, for the most part, independently. In total, 36-43% of the AS events produce transcripts that would be targets of the non-sense-mediated decay pathway, if that pathway were to operate in plants as in humans. Forty percent of Arabidopsis AS genes are alternatively spliced also in rice, with some examples strongly suggesting a role of the AS event as an evolutionary conserved mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. We created a comprehensive web-interfaced database to compile and visualize the evidence for alternative splicing in plants (Alternative Splicing in Plants, available at www.plantgdb.org/ASIP).
16644142	Nucleotide substitution pattern in rice paralogues: implication for negative correlation between the synonymous substitution rate and codon usage bias.	2006	Gene	Understanding the correlation between synonymous substitution rate and GC content is essential to decipher the gene evolution. However, it has been controversial on their relationship. We analyzed the GC content and synonymous substitution rate in 1092 paralogues produced by two large-scale duplication events in the rice genome. According to the GC content at the third codon sites (GC3), the paralogues were classified into GC3-rich and GC3-poor genes. By referring to their outgroup sequences, we inferred the last common ancestor of sister paralogues and, consequently, calculated the average synonymous substitution rate for two gene classes. The results suggest that average synonymous substitution rate is lower in GC3-rich genes than that in GC3-poor genes, indicating that the synonymous substitution rate is negatively correlated with GC content in the rice genome. Through characterizing the synonymous nucleotide substitution pattern, we found a strong synonymous nucleotide substitution frequency bias from AT to GC in GC3-rich genes. This indicates possible limitations of commonly used methods developed to estimate the synonymous substitution rate. Their estimates might produce misleading results on correlation between the synonymous substitution rate and GC content.
16645096	Autophagic fungal cell death is necessary for infection by the rice blast fungus.	2006	Science	Rice blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, which elaborates specialized infection cells called appressoria to penetrate the tough outer cuticle of the rice plant Oryza sativa. We found that the formation of an appressorium required, sequentially, the completion of mitosis, nuclear migration, and death of the conidium (fungal spore) from which the infection originated. Genetic intervention during mitosis prevented both appressorium development and conidium death. Impairment of autophagy, by the targeted mutation of the MgATG8 gene, arrested conidial cell death but rendered the fungus nonpathogenic. Thus, the initiation of rice blast requires autophagic cell death of the conidium.
16690022	Validation of housekeeping genes as internal control for studying gene expression in rice by quantitative real-time PCR.	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	For accurate and reliable gene expression results, normalization of real-time PCR data is required against a control gene, which displays highly uniform expression in living organisms during various phases of development and under different environmental conditions. We assessed the gene expression of 10 frequently used housekeeping genes, including 18S rRNA, 25S rRNA, UBC, UBQ5, UBQ10, ACT11, GAPDH, eEF-1alpha, eIF-4a, and beta-TUB, in a diverse set of 25 rice samples. Their expression varied considerably in different tissue samples analyzed. The expression of UBQ5 and eEF-1alpha was most stable across all the tissue samples examined. However, 18S and 25S rRNA exhibited most stable expression in plants grown under various environmental conditions. Also, a set of two genes was found to be better as control for normalization of the data. The expression of these genes (with more uniform expression) can be used for normalization of real-time PCR results for gene expression studies in a wide variety of samples in rice.
16702555	Complex genetic networks underlying the defensive system of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Complete resistance (CR) and partial resistance (PR) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to its bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), was genetically dissected by using 2 mapping populations and 10 Xoo races. Two CR genes, 50 quantitative resistance loci, and 60 digenic interactions were identified, which showed various degrees of race specificity to the Xoo races. The complex epistasis between these loci led us to the discovery of complex genetic networks underlying the rice defensive system to Xoo. The networks consisted of two major components: one representing interactions between alleles at the R loci of rice and alleles at the corresponding avirulence loci of Xoo for CR and the other comprising interactions between quantitative resistance loci in rice and their corresponding aggressiveness loci in Xoo for PR. The race specificity of PR and its strong genetic overlap with CR indicate that PR is essentially "weaker" CR. The genetic networks discovered are expected to maintain a high level of the allelic diversity at avirulent loci in the pathogen by stabilizing selection, which may maintain a high allelic diversity at R loci in the host by the frequency-dependent selection.
16753273	Accumulation of sense-antisense transcripts of the rice catalase gene CatB under dark conditions requires signals from shoots.	2006	Gene	The amount of mRNA of the Oryza sativa L., cv. Nipponbare (rice) catalase gene, CatB, was decreased in the roots of intact seedlings kept in continuous darkness (DD). In contrast, sense and antisense unspliced CatB transcripts accumulated in the same tissue. Both strands cover the entire CatB-coding region, and form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The results of RNA dot-blot hybridization analysis using low molecular weight RNAs suggested that the sense and antisense CatB transcripts were more stable under DD conditions than under a light-dark regimen (LD). After shifting the lighting conditions from DD to LD, both the sense and antisense CatB transcripts were hardly detected, and the amount of CatB mRNA was restored. From these results, the antisense CatB transcripts might play a role in suppressing the normal processing of sense CatB transcript and also CatB protein synthesis by dsRNA formation, under conditions unsuitable for plant growth such as DD. This study indicates that signals transmitted from shoots are associated with the accumulation of sense and antisense CatB transcripts in roots under DD conditions, and that auxin is one of the possible signals.
16763049	Identification of bifunctional delta12/omega3 fatty acid desaturases for improving the ratio of omega3 to omega6 fatty acids in microbes and plants.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We report the identification of bifunctional Delta12/omega3 desaturases from Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium graminearum, and Magnaporthe grisea. The bifunctional activity of these desaturases distinguishes them from all known Delta12 or omega3 fatty acid desaturases. The omega3 desaturase activity of these enzymes also shows a broad omega6 fatty acid substrate specificity by their ability to convert linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid, di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid to the omega3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), stearidonic acid, eicosatetraenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that omega3 desaturases arose by independent gene duplication events from a Delta12 desaturase ancestor. Expression of F. moniliforme Delta12/omega3 desaturase resulted in high ALA content in both Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast naturally deficient in omega3 desaturation, and soybean. In soybean, seed-specific expression resulted in 70.9 weight percent of total fatty acid (%TFA) ALA in a transformed seed compared with 10.9%TFA in a null segregant seed and 53.2%TFA in the current best source of ALA, linseed oil. The ALA/LA ratio in transformed seed was 22.3, a 110- and 7-fold improvement over the null segregant seed and linseed oil, respectively. Thus, these desaturases have potential for producing nutritionally desirable omega3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA, with a significantly improved ratio of omega3/omega6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in both oilseeds and oleaginous microbes.
16769152	Molecular cloning and characterization of an arginine decarboxylase gene up-regulated by chilling stress in rice seedlings.	2007	J Plant Physiol	We cloned a rice cDNA encoding a putative arginine decarboxylase (ADC) protein, a key enzyme involved with putrescine (Put) biosynthesis in plants. The isolated full-length cDNA (OsADC1) contains an insert consisting of 2451 bp. The longest open reading frame within encodes a putative protein of 702 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 74 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.9. ClustalW alignment revealed that the deduced OsADC1 protein sequence shares overall 60% and 61% identity at the amino acid level with the Pisum sativum and Glycine max ADC proteins, respectively. Additionally, several OsADC1 regions exhibited striking similarity with these two other plant ADC protein sequences, including motifs characteristic of ADC proteins. Further, RNA gel blot analysis revealed markedly increased OsADC1 mRNA levels in rice seedling leaves subjected to chilling stress. Interestingly, this treatment induced a concomitant increase in free Put levels in these samples, coincident with the observed elevated OsADC1 mRNA levels. To our knowledge, this represents the first direct evidence supporting essentially chilling-specific regulation of a rice ADC gene that also potentially influences Put accumulation, a phenomenon previously noted in cold-stressed rice seedlings.
16809532	Food for thought: lower-than-expected crop yield stimulation with rising CO2 concentrations.	2006	Science	Model projections suggest that although increased temperature and decreased soil moisture will act to reduce global crop yields by 2050, the direct fertilization effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) will offset these losses. The CO2 fertilization factors used in models to project future yields were derived from enclosure studies conducted approximately 20 years ago. Free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) technology has now facilitated large-scale trials of the major grain crops at elevated [CO2] under fully open-air field conditions. In those trials, elevated [CO2] enhanced yield by approximately 50% less than in enclosure studies. This casts serious doubt on projections that rising [CO2] will fully offset losses due to climate change.
16822623	Evolutionary history of the Asr gene family.	2006	Gene	The Asr gene family is widespread in higher plants. Most Asr genes are up-regulated under different environmental stress conditions and during fruit ripening. ASR proteins are localized in the nucleus and their likely function is transcriptional regulation. In cultivated tomato, we identified a novel fourth family member, named Asr4, which maps close to its sibling genes Asr1-Asr2-Asr3 and displays an unshared region coding for a domain containing a 13-amino acid repeat. In this work we were able to expand our previous analysis for Asr2 and investigated the coding regions of the four known Asr paralogous genes in seven tomato species from different geographic locations. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis on ASR proteins. The first conclusion drawn from this work is that tomato ASR proteins cluster together in the tree. This observation can be explained by a scenario of concerted evolution or birth and death of genes. Secondly, our study showed that Asr1 is highly conserved at both replacement and synonymous sites within the genus Lycopersicon. ASR1 protein sequence conservation might be associated with its multiple functions in different tissues while the low rate of synonymous substitutions suggests that silent variation in Asr1 is selectively constrained, which is probably related to its high expression levels. Finally, we found that Asr1 activation under water stress is not conserved between Lycopersicon species.
16831523	Genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene family in Populus trichocarpa.	2006	Gene	Populus trichocarpa (poplar) is distinguished from its herbaceous counterparts Arabidopsis and rice by its woody structure, perennial life cycle, and dioecious, two-whorled flowers. MADS-box genes are known to be involved in many important processes during plant development. Investigation of the poplar genome revealed 105 putative functional MADS-box genes and 12 pseudogenes. These numbers are comparable to those in Arabidopsis. However, poplar has 64 type II MADS-box genes, implying a higher birth rate when compared with Arabidopsis (64 vs.47). In addition to duplications for floral organ identity genes, TM3-like, StMADS11, ANR1 and Bs clades were significantly increased. As indicated by the phylogenetic analysis, there exist at least two MIKC* MADS-box genes in the poplar genome. In contrast, only 41 putative functional type I genes and 9 pseudogenes were found, suggesting that the poplar type I MADS-box genes have experienced a lower rate in both birth and death. Poplar MADS-box genes were distributed on all linkage groups (LGs), except LG XIX. Like other gene families, poplar MADS-box gene family has expanded through tandem gene duplication and segmental duplication events as demonstrated by two genomic regions where clustered MADS-box genes exhibited high similarities in the MADS-box domains. A survey of poplar EST sequences showed that MADS-box genes were expressed in wood and cambium tissues, which are specific to woody plants. The expression of common MADS-box gene in tree-specific tissues suggests that the novel function combinations of a set of genes similar to those in herbaceous plants may account for the development of woody characteristics in poplar.
16843620	Genome-wide comparative analyses of domain organisation of repertoires of protein kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2006	Gene	A comparative analysis on protein kinases encoded in the completely sequenced genomes of two plant species, namely Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa spp japonica cv. Nipponbare is reported in the current study. We have analysed 836 and 1386 kinases identified from A. thaliana and the O. sativa genomes respectively. Their classification into known subfamilies reveals selective expansions of the plant receptor kinase subfamily comprising of Ser/Thr receptor kinases. The presence of calcium dependent kinases, and potential absence of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase of the type found in other (non-plant) eukaryotes, are other notable features of the two plant kinomes described here. An analysis on domain organisation of each of the protein kinases encoded in the plant genome has been carried out. Uncommon composition of functional domains like nuclear translocation factor domain, redox sensor domain (PAS), ACT and lectin domains are observed in few protein kinases shared between the two plant species. Biochemical functions characteristic of the domains recruited in these protein kinase gene products suggest their mode of regulation by alternate cellular localisation, oxidation potential, amino acid flux and binding of carbohydrates. Occurrence of multi-functional kinases with diverse enzymatic modules, such as Transposases and peptidases, tethered to the kinase catalytic domain is another interesting feature of the protein kinase complement of the O. sativa genome. Co-occurrence of diverse nucleotide and carbohydrate binding domains with catalytic kinase domain containing gene products has also been observed. Putative homologues of protein kinases of A. thaliana that regulate plant-specific physiological processes like ethylene hormone response, somatic embryogenesis and pathogen defence have been identified in O. sativa genome as well.
16857943	Genome of Rice Cluster I archaea--the key methane producers in the rice rhizosphere.	2006	Science	Rice fields are a global source of the greenhouse gas methane, which is produced by methanogenic archaea, and by methanogens of Rice Cluster I (RC-I) in particular. RC-I methanogens are not yet available in pure culture, and the mechanistic reasons for their prevalence in rice fields are unknown. We reconstructed a complete RC-I genome (3.18 megabases) using a metagenomic approach. Sequence analysis demonstrated an aerotolerant, H2/CO2-dependent lifestyle and enzymatic capacities for carbohydrate metabolism and assimilatory sulfate reduction, hitherto unknown among methanogens. These capacities and a unique set of antioxidant enzymes and DNA repair mechanisms as well as oxygen-insensitive enzymes provide RC-I with a selective advantage over other methanogens in its habitats, thereby explaining the prevalence of RC-I methanogens in the rice rhizosphere.

16876912	Phylogenetic and expression analysis of sucrose phosphate synthase isozymes in plants.	2007	J Plant Physiol	In plants and microbes, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) is an important enzyme in sucrose biosynthesis. Several different isozymes of SPS exist in plants. Genomic and EST sequence data from Arabidopsis, rice and maize has been analyzed. This analysis has revealed that the Arabidopsis genome contains four unique SPS genes. The rice databases (Monsanto proprietary, and public databases) contain five unique full-length SPS genes. Using the Monsanto maize EST and genomic sequence databases, we have identified five full length and two partial SPS sequences, bringing the total number of presently known maize SPS genes to at least seven. Phylogenetic analysis of all known SPS sequences revealed several putative evolutionary branches of SPS. We have classified SPS genes into three major groups in higher plants, all with distinct features from the known microbial SPS genes. Furthermore, this analysis suggests evolutionary divergence of monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) SPS sequences. The evidence suggests that several gene duplication events occurred at various points during evolution, both before and after the monocot/dicot split. It appears that at least one of the major forms of SPS genes may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. In addition, several more recent gene duplication events may have occurred after maize/rice speciation, giving rise to additional SPS genes in maize. Some of the variants lack one or more of the presently known regulatory sites, implying that this evolutionary divergence may have given rise to enzymes with functional differences. We present evidence from transcript distribution studies using cDNA libraries as well as transcriptional profiling experiments and propose that specific SPS genes have diverse patterns of expression that are sometimes responsive to environmental signals. Our data suggests that higher plant SPS isozymes differ with respect to their patterns of expression and regulation and that our proposed phylogenetic classification reflects specific functional categories for higher plant SPS isozymes.
16893175	Role of phenylalanine B10 in plant nonsymbiotic hemoglobins.	2006	Biochemistry	All plants contain an unusual class of hemoglobins that display bis-histidyl coordination yet are able to bind exogenous ligands such as oxygen. Structurally homologous hexacoordinate hemoglobins (hxHbs) are also found in animals (neuroglobin and cytoglobin) and some cyanobacteria, where they are thought to play a role in free radical scavenging or ligand sensing. The plant hxHbs can be distinguished from the others because they are only weakly hexcacoordinate in the ferrous state, yet no structural mechanism for regulating hexacoordination has been articulated to account for this behavior. Plant hxHbs contain a conserved Phe at position B10 (Phe(B10)), which is near the reversibly coordinated distal His(E7). We have investigated the effects of Phe(B10) mutation on kinetic and equilibrium constants for hexacoordination and exogenous ligand binding in the ferrous and ferric oxidation states. Kinetic and equilibrium constants for hexacoordination and ligand binding along with CO-FTIR spectroscopy, midpoint reduction potentials, and the crystal structures of two key mutant proteins (F40W and F40L) reveal that Phe(B10) is an important regulatory element in hexacoordination. We show that Phe at this position is the only amino acid that facilitates stable oxygen binding to the ferrous Hb and the only one that promotes ligand binding in the ferric oxidation states. This work presents a structural mechanism for regulating reversible intramolecular coordination in plant hxHbs.

16901582	Effect of low temperature on ethanolic fermentation in rice seedlings.	2007	J Plant Physiol	Rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) were incubated at 5-30 degrees C for 48 h and the effect of temperature on ethanolic fermentation in the seedlings was investigated in terms of low-temperature adaptation. Activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1) in roots and shoots of the seedlings were low at temperatures of 20-30 degrees C, whereas temperatures of 5, 7.5 and 10 degrees C significantly increased ADH and PDC activities in the roots and shoots. Temperatures of 5-10 degrees C also increased ethanol concentrations in the roots and shoots. The ethanol concentrations in the roots and shoots at 7.5 degrees C were 16- and 12-times greater than those in the roots and shoots at 25 degrees C, respectively. These results indicate that low temperatures (5-10 degrees C) induced ethanolic fermentation in the roots and shoots of the seedlings. Ethanol is known to prevent lipid degradation in plant membrane, and increased membrane-lipid fluidization. In addition, an ADH inhibitor, 4-methylpyrazole, decreased low-temperature tolerance in roots and shoots of rice seedlings and this reduction in the tolerance was recovered by exogenous applied ethanol. Therefore, production of ethanol by ethanolic fermentation may lead to low-temperature adaptation in rice plants by altering the physical properties of membrane lipids.

16996700	Evolutionary pathways of an ancient gene recX.	2007	Gene	RecX is a regulator of RecA activity by interacting with RecA protein or RecA filaments. Genes encoding RecX were found in genomes of a wide diversity of bacteria and some plants (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa). Our comparative genome analysis showed that although members of the RecX family are found in many bacterial species, they are not found in archaea and the only gene found in eukaryotes is likely derived from bacteria genomes. It is therefore proposed that RecX is of bacterial origin, and the gene had presented in the common ancestor of bacteria. Moreover, bacterial RecX and plant RecX domain are homologues, and RecX domain in plants may have derived from bacteria via unknown pathways. Plant RecX-like protein was formed by a gene fusion event between a unique N-terminal domain of unknown origin and RecX domain within plant cells. Finally, three possible evolutionary pathways from bacteria to plant were discussed.
17000027	Expression of rice acyl-CoA oxidase isoenzymes in response to wounding.	2007	J Plant Physiol	To elucidate the role of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX; EC 1.3.3.6) in plants, the expression patterns of rice ACXs in response to wounding were characterized. Three isogenes of ACX were identified in the rice genome. The deduced proteins of OsACX1, OsACX2 and OsACX3 consist of 669, 699 and 685 amino acid residues, respectively. The results from reverse transcriptase-PCR indicate that OsACX1 is expressed in leaves, stems, and roots, but was barely detectable in germinating seeds. OsACX2 was expressed predominantly in seeds. Only OsACX1 was upregulated by wounding, both locally and systemically. The expression of OsACX2 and OsACX3 remained unchanged. It is suggested that OsACX2 is involved in providing germinating seeds with sugar and energy, while OsACX1 plays a role in the synthesis of jasmonic acid in response to wounding.
17027118	Transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing AtBAK1 are semi-dwarfed and hypersensitive to 24-epibrassinolide.	2007	J Plant Physiol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are endogenous plant hormones essential for plant growth and development. Brassinosteroid insensitive1 (BRI1)-assocaiated receptor kinase (BAK1) is one of the key components in the BR signal transduction pathway due to its direct association with the BR receptor, BRI1. Although BRI1 and its orthologs have been identified from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, less is known about BAK1 and its orthologs in higher plants other than Arabidopsis. This article provides the first piece of evidence that AtBAK1 can greatly affect growth and development of rice plants when ectopically expressed, suggesting that rice may share similar BR perception mechanism via BRI1/BAK1 complex. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants displayed semi-dwarfism and shortened primary roots. Physiological analysis and cell morphology assay demonstrated that the observed phenotypes in transgenic plants were presumably caused by hypersensitivity to endogenous levels of BRs, different from BR insensitive and deficient rice mutants. Consistently, several known BR inducible genes were also upregulated in transgenic rice plants, further suggesting that BAK1 was able to affect BR signaling in rice. On the other hand, the transgenic plants generated by overproducing AtBAK1 may potentially have agricultural applications because the dwarfed phenotype is generally resistant to lodging, while the fertility remains unaffected.
17052766	Common mechanisms regulating expression of rice aleurone genes that contribute to the primary response for gibberellin.	2006	Biochim Biophys Acta	During germination of cereal seeds, aleurone cells respond to gibberellins (GA) by synthesizing and secreting hydrolytic enzymes that mobilize the reserved nutrients. It has been shown that products of early GA response genes, like a transcription factor GAMyb, act as key molecules leading to this regulation. Pivotal roles of GAMyb on expression of hydrolase genes have been well documented, whereas regulation of GAMyb expression itself remains obscure. In order to understand virtual mechanisms of the GA-mediated expression of genes, it is important to know how GA control expression of early GA response genes. Using an aleurone transient expression system of rice (Oryza sativa L.), we examined GA responsive domains of early GA response genes in the aleurone, such as GAMyb and OsDof3. The upstream promoter could not confer GA response. Extensive analyses revealed the presence of enhancer-like activities in a large first intron. In Arabidopsis, intron enhancers have been identified in MADS-box homeotic genes, AGAMOUS (AG) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), in which large introns should not only confer proper gene expressions, but also associate with gene silencing by covalent modifications of both DNA and histone. These evidences prompt us to assign that chromatin-based control might be important for initial GA action. Based on this assumption, we have identified DNA methylation of the GAMyb locus in germinated rice seeds.
17077941	Photosynthetic and biochemical activities in flag leaves of a newly developed superhigh-yield hybrid rice (Oryza sativa) and its parents during the reproductive stage.	2007	J Plant Res	Responses of net photosynthetic rates to intercellular CO(2) concentration (P (n)/C (i) curves) and photochemical characteristics were investigated in flag leaves of newly developed superhigh-yield hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) LiangYouPeiJiu (LYPJ) and its maternal PeiAi64S (PA64S) and paternal WuMang9311 (WM9311) lines grown in the field during the reproductive stage. The results showed that photosynthetic functions, such as the electron transport activities of photosystems and photophosphorylation, assessed in vivo from P (n)/C (i) curves under field conditions declined more or earlier than those obtained in vitro. The degradation of polypeptides of thylakoid membranes was slower than those for P (Ca=360) (light-saturated net photosynthetic rate measured at 360 mumol mol(-1)) and CE (carboxylation efficiency, obtained from the initial slope of the P (n)/C (i) curve). The initial inhibition of the PSII electron transport and oxygen-evolving activity induced by senescence occurred before the degradation of the oxygen-evolving complex. In comparison, LYPJ had intermediate photosynthetic functions in the early stage of leaf development, but greater photochemical activities in the mid and late stages. WM9311 showed a similar pattern of changes but lower values, and PA64S had higher values in the early stage but showed a faster rate of senescence than LYPJ. These findings implied that the hybrid LYPJ demonstrated intermediate photosynthetic activities between its parents in the early stage of leaf development, whereas it had higher photosynthetic activities than its parents in the mid and late stages, which may be responsible for its high yield.
17139419	Development of genotype-independent regeneration system for transformation of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica).	2007	J Plant Res	Rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) is an important economic crop in many countries. Although a variety of conventional methods have been developed to improve this plant, manipulation by genetic engineering is still complicated. We have established a system of multiple shoot regeneration from rice shoot apical meristem. By use of MS medium containing 4 mg L(-1) thidiazuron (TDZ) multiple shoots were successfully developed directly from the meristem without an intervening callus stage. All rice cultivars tested responded well on the medium and regenerated to plantlets that were readily transferred to soil within 5-8 weeks. The tissue culture system was suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and different factors affecting transformation efficiency were investigated. Agrobacterium strain EHA105 containing the plasmid pCAMBIA1301 was used. The lowest concentration of hygromycin B in combined with either 250 mg L(-1) carbenicillin or 250 mg L(-1) cefotaxime to kill the rice shoot apical meristem was 50 mg L(-1) and carbenicillin was more effective than cefotaxime. Two-hundred micromolar acetosyringone had no effect on the efficiency of transient expression. Sonication of rice shoot apical meristem for 10 s during bacterial immersion increased transient GUS expression in three-day co-cultivated seedlings. The gus gene was found to be integrated into the genome of the T(0) transformant plantlets.
17182003	Characterization of the plant homolog of Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1: Involvement in DNA repair and recombination.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The Nbs1 gene is known to code for a protein involved in the hereditary cancer-prone disease, Nijmegen breakage syndrome. This gene is conserved in animals and fungi, but no plant homolog is known. The work reported here describes a homolog of Nbs1 isolated from higher plants. The Nbs1 proteins from both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa are smaller in size than animal or yeast Nbs1, but both contain the conserved Nbs1 domains such as the FHA/BRCT domain, the Mre11-binding domain, and the Atm-interacting domain in orientations similar to what is seen in animal Nbs1. The OsNbs1 protein interacted not only with plant Mre11, but also with animal Mre11. In plants, OsNbs1 mRNA expression was found to be higher in the shoot apex and young flower, and AtNbs1 expression increased when plants were exposed to 100 Gy of X-rays. These results suggest that plant Nbs1 could participate in a Rad50/Mre11/Nbs1 complex, and could be essential for the regulation of DNA recombination and DNA damage responses.
17187943	An exploration of 3'-end processing signals and their tissue distribution in Oryza sativa.	2007	Gene	The 3' untranslated regions deeply affect many properties of eukaryotic mRNA. In plants, the polyadenine control signals contained in these regions seem to be more variable than of mammals. Three cDNA libraries derived from the leaf, endosperm and stem tissues of rice were sequenced from the 3'-end. Of the 9911 transcripts analyzed, 5723 unique transcripts were identified from the leaf sequences, 2934 from the endosperm and 1254 from the stem. The information entropy and two statistical methods were used to compile a list of rice poly(A) control signals. Based on their distribution, these signals can be roughly grouped into far-upstream element (FUE), near-upstream element (NUE), T-rich region (TRE) and downstream element (DE). The distribution of rice conserved regions is similar to the previous model from Arabidopsis and yeast, with a few differences in word constructions. Interestingly, we also found the word distributions were diverse in the cleavage site of downstream sequences of different rice tissues. The signal bias in downstream sequences may lead mRNA to be differently cleaved in different rice tissues.
17210233	Birth and death of genes promoted by transposable elements in Oryza sativa.	2007	Gene	Despite a wide distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in the genomes of higher eukaryotes, much of their evolutionary significance remains unclear. Recent studies have indicated that TEs are involved with biological processes such as gene regulation and the generation of new exons in mammals. In addition, the completion of the genome sequencings in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa has permitted scientist to describe a genome-wide overview in plants. In this study, we examined the positions of TEs in the genome of O. sativa. Although we found that more than 10% of the structural genes contained TEs, they were underrepresented in exons compared with non-exonic regions. TEs also appeared to be inserted preferentially in 3'-untranslated regions in exons. These results suggested that purifying selection against TE insertion has played a major role during evolution. Moreover, our comparison of the numbers of TEs in the protein-coding regions between single copy genes and duplicate genes showed that TEs were more frequent in duplicate than single copy genes. This observation indicated that gene duplication events created a large number of functionally redundant genes. Subsequently, many of them were destroyed by TEs because the redundant copies were released from purifying selection. Another biological role of TEs was found to be the recruitment of new exons. We found that approximately 2% of protein-coding genes contained TEs in their coding regions. Insertion of TEs in genic regions may have the potential to be an evolutionary driving force for the creation of new biological functions.
17213316	Plants and people from the Early Neolithic to Shang periods in North China.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	An assemblage of charred plant remains collected from 26 sites in the Yiluo valley of North China as part of an archaeological survey spans the period from the sixth millennium to 1300 calibrated calendrical years (cal) B.C. The plant remains document a long sequence of crops, weeds, and other plants in the country. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of sediment sampling as part of an archaeological survey. Ten accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates on crop remains inform an assessment of the sequence of agricultural development in the region. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica subsp. italica) was grown during the Early Neolithic period and was the principal crop for at least four millennia. Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) was significantly less important throughout the sequence. Rice (Oryza sativa) was introduced by 3000 cal B.C. but apparently was not an important local crop. Wheat became a significant crop between 1600 and 1300 cal B.C. The weed flora diversified through time and were dominated by annual grasses, some of which were probably fodder for domesticated animals. The North China farming tradition that emphasized dry crops (millets, wheat, and legumes) with some rice appears to have been established at the latest by the Early Shang (Erligang; 1600-1300 B.C.) period.
17215059	The participation of hydrogen peroxide in methyl jasmonate-induced NH(4)(+) accumulation in rice leaves.	2007	J Plant Physiol	Ammonium is a central intermediate in the nitrogen metabolism of plants. We have previously shown that methyl jasmonate (MJ) not only increases the content of H(2)O(2), but also causes NH(4)(+) accumulation in rice leaves. More recently, H(2)O(2) is thought to constitute a general signal molecule participating in the recognition of and the response to stress factors. In this study, we examined the role of H(2)O(2) as a link between MJ and subsequent NH(4)(+) accumulation in detached rice leaves. MJ treatment resulted in an accumulation of NH(4)(+) in detached rice leaves, which was preceded by a decrease in the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) and an increase in the specific activities of protease and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). GS, PAL, and protease appear to be the enzymes responsible for the accumulation of NH(4)(+) in MJ-treated detached rice leaves. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a chemical trap for H(2)O(2), was observed to be effective in inhibiting MJ-induced NH(4)(+) accumulation in detached rice leaves. Scavengers of free radicals (sodium benzoate, SB, and glutathione, GSH), nitric oxide donor (N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone, PBN), the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium chloride, DPI, and imidazole, IMD), and inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin, WM, and LY 294002, LY), which have previously been shown to prevent MJ-induced H(2)O(2) production in detached rice leaves, inhibited MJ-induced NH(4)(+) accumulation. Similarly, changes in enzymes responsible for NH(4)(+) accumulation induced by MJ were observed to be inhibited by DMTU, SB, GSH, PBN DPI, IMD, WM, or LY. Seedlings of rice cultivar Taichung Native 1 (TN1) are jasmonic acid (JA)-sensitive and those of cultivar Tainung 67 (TNG67) are JA-insensitive. On treatment with JA, H(2)O(2) accumulated in the leaves of TN1 seedlings but not in the leaves of TNG67. Ethylene action inhibitor, silver thiosulfate, was observed to inhibit MJ- and abscisic acid-induced accumulation of NH(4)(+) and changes in enzymes responsible for NH(4)(+) accumulation in detached rice leaves, suggesting that the action of MJ and ABA is ethylene dependent.
17250976	Comparative analysis of cis-encoded antisense RNAs in eukaryotes.	2007	Gene	Recent large-scale transcriptomic analyses have identified numerous endogenously encoded cis-antisense RNAs that are thought to play important roles in diverse cellular processes although comprehensive comparative studies among multiple species have yet to be performed. To investigate conserved genomic features across various species that may be related to sense-antisense regulation, we performed comparative analysis of approximately 1000-2000 cis-encoded antisense RNA pairs from five model eukaryotes (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa). Analysis of overlapping patterns relative to the exon-intron structure revealed that the number of pairs sharing the 3' part of the transcripts was larger than that of the 5'-sharing pairs except in rice. Moreover, most of the well-conserved sense-antisense pairs between human and mouse exhibited 3'-overlaps, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms involving these regions may be important in sense-antisense transcription. Functional classification using Gene Ontology revealed that genes related to catalytic activity, nucleotide binding, DNA metabolism, and mitochondria were preferentially distributed within the set of exon-overlapping sense-antisense genes compared to the non-exon-overlapping group in animals. Despite the numerous sense-antisense pairs identified in human and mouse individually, the number of conserved pairs was extremely small (6.6% of the entire set). Whereas both genes of most of the conserved sense-antisense pairs had protein-coding potential, nearly half of the non-conserved pairs included a non-coding RNA, suggesting that non-coding sense-antisense RNAs may function in species-specific regulatory pathways.
17254555	Identification of drought-induced microRNAs in rice.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large new class of small non-coding RNAs. To date, hundreds of microRNAs have been identified in plants. MicroRNAs play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or repressing translation. To better understand microRNA function, we have used an oligonucleotide microarray to monitor rice (Oryza sativa) microRNA expression profile under drought stress. Two drought-induced microRNAs were identified. Furthermore, miR-169g was confirmed as the only member induced by drought among the miR-169 family and the induction of miR-169g was more prominent in roots than in shoots. Sequence analysis revealed occurrence of two proximate DREs (dehydration-responsive element) in the upstream of the MIR-169g, suggesting that miR-169g expression may be regulated directly by CBF/DREBs.
17306416	Heredity, physiology and mapping of a chlorophyll content gene of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	J Plant Physiol	A single dominant gene Gc controls the trait of high chlorophyll (Chl) content in rice (cultivar (cv.) Zhenshan 97B). The contents of Chl b and total Chl increased 100% and 25%, respectively, when Gc was introduced. In addition, photosynthetic rate, biomass and grain yield also increased by 20%, 17% and 16%, respectively. Three simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers (rm462, rm6340 and rm6464) that are linked to Gc were identified by amplification of DNA samples from near-isogenic lines using two hundred pairs of primers. The genetic distances on the short arm of rice chromosome 1 between Gc and rm6464, rm6340 and rm462 were 0, 0.588 and 1.18 cM, respectively.
17350139	Expression of mitochondrial tatC in Nicotiana tabacum is responsive to benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid.	2007	J Plant Physiol	A cDNA, up-regulated upon treatment of tobacco cells with salicylic acid and benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester, was identified by differential RNA display and the full sequence obtained. This mitochondrial gene, twin arginine translocation (tatC), resembles orthologues across different species, including the gene that codes for a sec-independent membrane translocating protein in bacteria. Hypothetical tatC proteins have also been identified in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oenothera berteriana, Beta vulgaris, Oryza sativa and Marchantia polymorpha. Comparative protein analysis indicates a similar function for the tatC gene. The up-regulation of the tatC gene in a 3kbp transcript was confirmed by RNA gel blot analysis.
17404686	Induced expression of oryzain alpha gene encoding a cysteine proteinase under stress conditions.	2007	J Plant Res	Oryzain alpha-A, a cysteine proteinase gene was cloned from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Aichi-asahi) leaves infected with Magnaporthe grisea. The protein sequence deduced for oryzain alpha-A shares high identity with that of oryzain alpha, a gene expressed in germinating rice seed. Oryzain alpha-A gene expression was induced by the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and the transcript level was even higher in the compatible interaction with rice than in the incompatible interaction. Expression of oryzain alpha-A was also inducible by wounding, ultraviolet radiation, and treatment with salicylic acid and abscisic acid, with no expression induced by methyl jasmonate. The function of oryzain alpha-A in cell death in rice is discussed.

17446396	An evolutionarily conserved mechanism delimiting SHR movement defines a single layer of endodermis in plants.	2007	Science	Intercellular protein movement plays a critical role in animal and plant development. SHORTROOT (SHR) is a moving transcription factor essential for endodermis specification in the Arabidopsis root. Unlike diffusible animal morphogens, which form a gradient across multiple cell layers, SHR movement is limited to essentially one cell layer. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. We show that SCARECROW (SCR) blocks SHR movement by sequestering it into the nucleus through protein-protein interaction and a safeguard mechanism that relies on a SHR/SCR-dependent positive feedback loop for SCR transcription. Our studies with SHR and SCR homologs from rice suggest that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved, providing a plausible explanation why nearly all plants have a single layer of endodermis.
17449639	Mutational reconstructed ferric chelate reductase confers enhanced tolerance in rice to iron deficiency in calcareous soil.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Iron (Fe) deficiency is a worldwide agricultural problem on calcareous soils with low-Fe availability due to high soil pH. Rice plants use a well documented phytosiderophore-based system (Strategy II) to take up Fe from the soil and also possess a direct Fe2+ transport system. Rice plants are extremely susceptible to low-Fe supply, however, because of low phytosiderophore secretion and low Fe3+ reduction activity. A yeast Fe3+ chelate-reductase gene refre1/372, selected for better performance at high pH, was fused to the promoter of the Fe-regulated transporter, OsIRT1, and introduced into rice plants. The transgene was expressed in response to a low-Fe nutritional status in roots of transformants. Transgenic rice plants expressing the refre1/372 gene showed higher Fe3+ chelate-reductase activity and a higher Fe-uptake rate than vector controls under Fe-deficient conditions. Consequently, transgenic rice plants exhibited an enhanced tolerance to low-Fe availability and 7.9x the grain yield of nontransformed plants in calcareous soils. This report shows that enhancing the Fe3+ chelate-reductase activity of rice plants that normally have low endogenous levels confers resistance to Fe deficiency.
17456599	Following evolution's lead to a single residue switch for diterpene synthase product outcome.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	There have been few insights into the biochemical origins of natural product biosynthesis from primary metabolism. Of particular interest are terpene synthases, which often mediate the committed step in particular biosynthetic pathways so that alteration of their product outcome is a key step in the derivation of novel natural products. These enzymes also catalyze complex reactions of significant mechanistic interest. Following an evolutionary lead from two recently diverged, functionally distinct diterpene synthase orthologs from different subspecies of rice, we have identified a single residue that can switch product outcome. Specifically, the mutation of a conserved isoleucine to threonine that acts to convert not only the originally targeted isokaurene synthase into a specific pimaradiene synthase but also has a much broader effect, which includes conversion of the ent-kaurene synthases found in all higher plants for gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis to the production of pimaradiene. This surprisingly facile switch for diterpene synthase catalytic specificity indicates the ease with which primary (gibberellin) metabolism can be subverted to secondary biosynthesis and may underlie the widespread occurrence of pimaradiene-derived natural products. In addition, because this isoleucine is required for the mechanistically more complex cyclization to tetracyclic kaurene, whereas substitution with threonine "short-circuits" this mechanism to produce the "simpler" tricyclic pimaradiene, our results have some implications regarding the means by which terpene synthases specify product outcome.
17459330	Dependence of reaction center-type energy-dependent quenching on photosystem II antenna size.	2007	Biochim Biophys Acta	The effects of photosystem II antenna size on reaction center-type energy-dependent quenching (qE) were examined in rice plants grown under two different light intensities using both wild type and qE-less (OsPsbS knockout) mutant plants. Reaction center-type qE was detected by measuring non-photochemical quenching at 50 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1) white light intensity. We observed that in low light-grown rice plants, reaction center-type qE was higher than in high light-grown plants, and the amount of reaction center-type qE did not depend on zeaxanthin accumulation. This was confirmed in Arabidopsis npq1-2 mutant plants that lack zeaxanthin due to a mutation in the violaxanthin de-epoxidase enzyme. Although the electron transport rate measured at a light intensity of 50 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1) was the same in high light- and low light-grown wild type and mutant plants lacking PsbS protein, the generation of energy-dependent quenching was completely impaired only in mutant plants. Analyses of the pigment content, Lhcb proteins and D1 protein of PSII showed that the antenna size was larger in low light-grown plants, and this correlated with the amount of reaction center-type qE. Our results mark the first time that the reaction center-type qE has been shown to depend on photosystem II antenna size and, although it depends on the existence of PsbS protein, the extent of reaction center-type qE does not correlate with the transcript levels of PsbS protein. The presence of reaction center-type energy-dependent quenching, in addition to antenna-type quenching, in higher plants for dissipation of excess light energy demonstrates the complexity and flexibility of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants to respond to different environmental conditions.

17483453	Assessing risks of climate variability and climate change for Indonesian rice agriculture.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	El Niño events typically lead to delayed rainfall and decreased rice planting in Indonesia's main rice-growing regions, thus prolonging the hungry season and increasing the risk of annual rice deficits. Here we use a risk assessment framework to examine the potential impact of El Niño events and natural variability on rice agriculture in 2050 under conditions of climate change, with a focus on two main rice-producing areas: Java and Bali. We select a 30-day delay in monsoon onset as a threshold beyond which significant impact on the country's rice economy is likely to occur. To project the future probability of monsoon delay and changes in the annual cycle of rainfall, we use output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite of climate models, forced by increasing greenhouse gases, and scale it to the regional level by using empirical downscaling models. Our results reveal a marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050, as a result of changes in the mean climate, from 9-18% today (depending on the region) to 30-40% at the upper tail of the distribution. Predictions of the annual cycle of precipitation suggest an increase in precipitation later in the crop year (April-June) of approximately 10% but a substantial decrease (up to 75% at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September). These results indicate a need for adaptation strategies in Indonesian rice agriculture, including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop diversification, and early warning systems.
17498837	UV-induced momilactone B accumulation in rice rhizosphere.	2007	J Plant Physiol	UV-irradiation increased the concentration of momilactone B in shoots and roots of rice seedlings, and increasing the irradiation increased the concentration. The concentration in 90-min UV-irradiated shoots and roots, respectively, was 31.8- and 3.6-fold higher than that in non-irradiated shoots and roots. After UV-irradiation the concentration of momilactone B in rice shoots decreased. There was, however, an accumulation of momilactone B in the medium in which UV-irradiated seedlings were grown. Five days after UV-irradiation, momilactone B in the medium was at a level 2.5 times greater than on day 0, which was 47% of momilactone B in the seedlings, suggesting that rice may actively secrete momilactone B into medium. Therefore, UV-irradiation increased not only production of momilactone B in rice seedlings but also secretion of momilactone B into rice rhizosphere. As momilactone B acts as an antimicrobial and allelopathic agent, secretion of momilactone B into the rhizosphere may provide a competitive advantage for root establishment through local suppression of soil microorganism and inhibition of the growth of competing plant species.
17499610	Anti-inflammatory effects of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	NF-kappaB family of transcription factors are involved in numerous cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and inflammation. It was reported that hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HADs) are inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation. Rice bran oil contains a lot of phytosteryl ferulates, one of HADs. We have investigated effects of phytosteryl ferulates on NF-kappaB activation in macrophage. Cycloartenyl ferulate (CAF), one of phytosteryl ferulates, significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenese-2 but upregulated SOD activity. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed that CAF inhibited DNA-binding of NF-kappaB. CAF and phytosteryl ferulates probably have potentially anti-inflammatory properties.
17512990	Plant SET domain-containing proteins: structure, function and regulation.	None	Biochim Biophys Acta	Modification of the histone proteins that form the core around which chromosomal DNA is looped has profound epigenetic effects on the accessibility of the associated DNA for transcription, replication and repair. The SET domain is now recognized as generally having methyltransferase activity targeted to specific lysine residues of histone H3 or H4. There is considerable sequence conservation within the SET domain and within its flanking regions. Previous reviews have shown that SET proteins from Arabidopsis and maize fall into five classes according to their sequence and domain architectures. These classes generally reflect specificity for a particular substrate. SET proteins from rice were found to fall into similar groupings, strengthening the merit of the approach taken. Two additional classes, VI and VII, were established that include proteins with truncated/interrupted SET domains. Diverse mechanisms are involved in shaping the function and regulation of SET proteins. These include protein-protein interactions through both intra- and inter-molecular associations that are important in plant developmental processes, such as flowering time control and embryogenesis. Alternative splicing that can result in the generation of two to several different transcript isoforms is now known to be widespread. An exciting and tantalizing question is whether, or how, this alternative splicing affects gene function. For example, it is conceivable that one isoform may debilitate methyltransferase function whereas the other may enhance it, providing an opportunity for differential regulation. The review concludes with the speculation that modulation of SET protein function is mediated by antisense or sense-antisense RNA.
17521606	Overproduction of OsSLRL2 alters the development of transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) was thought to be the sole DELLA protein in rice considering the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants. There were two other SLR1 homologous SLRL1 and SLRL2 (SLR1 like 1 and 2) which did not have DELLA domain but still shared high level similarity to the C-terminal region of SLR1 found after searching the whole rice genome. SLRL2 specially expressed in the embryo of immature rice seeds and the expression of SLRL2 was increased when treated with GA(3). The SLRL2 over-expressed transgenic Arabidopsis plants were semi-dwarfed, late flowering, and insensitive to GA. Moreover, the expression of AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1 was increased and the expression of AtGA2ox1 decreased, indicating SLRL2 was a repressor of GA signaling. We suggested SLRL2 might function to overcome too strong GA responses and maintained a basic repression. Furthermore, a different form of DELLA family in monocots against dicots was discussed.
17540516	Plant hemoglobins: what we know six decades after their discovery.	2007	Gene	This review describes contributions to the study of plant hemoglobins (Hbs) from a historical perspective with emphasis on non-symbiotic Hbs (nsHbs). Plant Hbs were first identified in soybean root nodules, are known as leghemoglobins (Lbs) and have been characterized in detail. It is widely accepted that a function of Lbs in nodules is to facilitate the diffusion of O(2) to bacteroids. For many years Hbs could not be identified in plants other than N(2)-fixing legumes, however in the 1980s a Hb was isolated from the nodules of the non-legume dicot plant Parasponia, a hb gene was cloned from the non-nodulating Trema, and Hbs were detected in nodules of actinorhizal plants. Gene expression analysis showed that Trema Hb transcripts exist in non-symbiotic roots. In the 1990s nsHb sequences were also identified in monocot and primitive (bryophyte) plants. In addition to Lbs and nsHbs, Hb sequences that are similar to microbial truncated (2/2) Hbs were also detected in plants. Plant nsHbs have been characterized in detail. These proteins have very high O(2)-affinities because of an extremely low O(2)-dissociation constant. Analysis of rice Hb1 showed that distal His coordinates heme Fe and stabilizes bound O(2); this means that O(2) is not released easily from oxygenated nsHbs. Non-symbiotic hb genes are expressed in specific plant tissues, and overexpress in organs of stressed plants. These observations suggest that nsHbs have functions additional to O(2)-transport, such as to modulate levels of ATP and NO.
17558543	Identification of the major protein components of rice egg cells.	2007	J Plant Res	The female gamete, the egg cell, is a specially differentiated haploid cell that develops into an embryo following fertilization. In the present study, we analyzed egg cell lysates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology and identified the major proteins expressed in rice egg cells. The proteins identified included glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ascorbate peroxidase and heat shock protein 90. The abundant existence of chaperons and antioxidant enzymes in plant egg cells indicates that the major protein components of plant egg cells are partly analogous to those of mammalian eggs and oocytes.
17563377	Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIAgamma1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) induces the expression of the host gene Os8N3, which results in increased host susceptibility to bacterial blight of rice. Here, we show that PXO99(A) affects the expression of two additional genes in a type III secretion system-dependent manner, one encoding a bZIP transcription factor (OsTFX1) and the other the small subunit of the transcription factor IIA located on chromosome 1 (OsTFIIAgamma1). Induction of OsTFX1 and OsTFIIAgamma1 depended on the type III effector genes pthXo6 and pthXo7, respectively, both encoding two previously undescribed members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. pthXo7 is strain-specific and may reflect adaptation to the resistance mediated by xa5, an allele of OsTFIIAgamma5 encoding a second form of the TFIIA small subunit on chromosome 5 of rice. The loss of pthXo6 resulted in reduced pathogen virulence, and ectopic expression of OsTFX1 abrogated the requirement for pthXo6 for full virulence. X. oryzae pv. oryzae therefore modulates the expression of multiple host genes using multiple TAL effectors from a single strain, and evidence supports the hypothesis that expression of the associated host genes contributes to host susceptibility to disease.
17566602	Over-expression of OsUGE-1 altered raffinose level and tolerance to abiotic stress but not morphology in Arabidopsis.	2007	J Plant Physiol	OsUGE-1 is known to be induced by various abiotic stresses, but its exact function in plants is unclear. In the present study, OsUGE-1 was over-expressed in Arabidopsis, transgenic plants conferred tolerance to salt, drought and freezing stress without altering plant morphology. In addition, transgenic plants showed a higher level of the soluble sugar raffinose than did wild-type plants. Our results suggest that elevated level of raffinose with over-expressed OsUGE-1 resulted in enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress. Thus, the gene may be applied to improve tolerance to abiotic stress in crops.
17568562	Antifungal activity of rice Pex5p, a receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	We have purified a novel antifungal protein from blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea)-treated rice leaves using consecutive chromatographies on CM-Sepharose ion-change, Affi-gel blue, and HPLC gel filtration columns. We determined the N-terminal peptide sequence of the purified protein and subjected it to the NCBI/BLAST database and found the protein to be a partial fragment of the peroxisomal receptor protein in rice (OsPex5p). After cloning two cDNAs encoding OsPEX5L and OsPEX5S genes that are splice variants of OsPEX5 from a rice leaf cDNA library, we investigated their antifungal properties. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and found to significantly inhibit cell growth of various pathogenic fungal strains. mRNA expression of the OsPEX5L gene was induced by diverse external stresses such as rice blast fungus, fungal elicitor, and other signaling molecules including H(2)O(2), abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. These results suggest that the peroxisomal receptor protein, OsPex5p, plays a critical role in the rice defense system against diverse external stresses including fungal pathogenic attack.
17573530	Rice-based mucosal vaccine as a global strategy for cold-chain- and needle-free vaccination.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Capable of inducing antigen-specific immune responses in both systemic and mucosal compartments without the use of syringe and needle, mucosal vaccination is considered ideal for the global control of infectious diseases. In this study, we developed a rice-based oral vaccine expressing cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) under the control of the endosperm-specific expression promoter 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 with codon usage optimization for expression in rice seed. An average of 30 mug of CTB per seed was stored in the protein bodies, which are storage organelles in rice. When mucosally fed, rice seeds expressing CTB were taken up by the M cells covering the Peyer's patches and induced CTB-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies with neutralizing activity. When expressed in rice, CTB was protected from pepsin digestion in vitro. Rice-expressed CTB also remained stable and thus maintained immunogenicity at room temperature for >1.5 years, meaning that antigen-specific mucosal immune responses were induced at much lower doses than were necessary with purified recombinant CTB. Because they require neither refrigeration (cold-chain management) nor a needle, these rice-based mucosal vaccines offer a highly practical and cost-effective strategy for orally vaccinating large populations against mucosal infections, including those that may result from an act of bioterrorism.
17586462	Alternative splicing of the OsBWMK1 gene generates three transcript variants showing differential subcellular localizations.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	In eukaryotes, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play important roles in various developmental processes and in environmental stress responses. Here, we show that alternative splicing of the OsBWMK1, a member of the rice MAPK family, generates three transcript variants, OsBWMK1L, OsBWMK1M, and OsBWMK1S. The OsBWMK1L transcript variant was highly and constitutively expressed in all rice tissues tested and its expression was not altered by various stress conditions, whereas OsBWMK1M and OsBWMK1S were normally expressed at low levels but were induced by various stresses. A transient expression assay demonstrated that OsBWMK1L::GFP and OsBWMK1M::GFP were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, whereas most OsBWMK1S::GFP was localized in the nucleus. Moreover, treatment with defense signaling related molecules, such as H(2)O(2) and SA, induced translocation of OsBWMK1 isoforms from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thus, our results suggest that alternative splicing of OsBWMK1 generates three different transcript variants that produce proteins with different subcellular localizations.
17592727	Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	B3 domain was identified as a novel DNA-binding motif specific to higher plant species. The B3 proteins play important roles in plant development. In the mutant W378, the mutant gene coding OsLFL1, a putative B3 transcription factor gene, was ectopically expressed. In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene Ehd1 and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses suggest that OsLFL1 binds to the RY cis-elements (CATGCATG) in the promoter of the Ehd1 gene. Thus, ectopically expressed OsLFL1 might repress Ehd1 via binding directly to the RY cis-elements in its promoter.
17595297	Conserved noncoding genomic sequences associated with a flowering-time quantitative trait locus in maize.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Flowering time is a fundamental trait of maize adaptation to different agricultural environments. Although a large body of information is available on the map position of quantitative trait loci for flowering time, little is known about the molecular basis of quantitative trait loci. Through positional cloning and association mapping, we resolved the major flowering-time quantitative trait locus, Vegetative to generative transition 1 (Vgt1), to an approximately 2-kb noncoding region positioned 70 kb upstream of an Ap2-like transcription factor that we have shown to be involved in flowering-time control. Vgt1 functions as a cis-acting regulatory element as indicated by the correlation of the Vgt1 alleles with the transcript expression levels of the downstream gene. Additionally, within Vgt1, we identified evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences across the maize-sorghum-rice lineages. Our results support the notion that changes in distant cis-acting regulatory regions are a key component of plant genetic adaptation throughout breeding and evolution.
17599908	Novel plant-specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors induced by biotic and abiotic stresses.	2007	J Biol Chem	The EL2 gene of rice (Oryza sativa), previously classified as early response gene against the potent biotic elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose and encoding a short polypeptide with unknown function, was identified as a novel cell cycle regulatory gene related to the recently reported SIAMESE (SIM) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. Iterative two-hybrid screens, in vitro pull-down assays, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses showed that Orysa; EL2 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDKA1;1 and D-type cyclins. No interaction was observed with the plant-specific B-type CDKs. The amino acid motif ELERFL was identified to be essential for cyclin, but not for CDK binding. Orysa;EL2 impaired the ability of Orysa; CYCD5;3 to complement a budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) triple CLN mutant, whereas recombinant protein inhibited CDK activity in vitro. Moreover, Orysa;EL2 was able to rescue the multicellular trichome phenotype of sim mutants of Arabidopsis, unequivocally demonstrating that Orysa;EL2 operates as a cell cycle inhibitor. Orysa;EL2 mRNA levels were induced by cold, drought, and propionic acid. Our data suggest that Orysa;EL2 encodes a new type of plant CDK inhibitor that links cell cycle progression with biotic and abiotic stress responses.
17600089	Generation of reactive oxygen species by fungal NADPH oxidases is required for rice blast disease.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	One of the first responses of plants to microbial attack is the production of extracellular superoxide surrounding infection sites. Here, we report that Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, undergoes an oxidative burst of its own during plant infection, which is associated with its development of specialized infection structures called appressoria. Scavenging of these oxygen radicals significantly delayed the development of appressoria and altered their morphology. We targeted two superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase-encoding genes, Nox1 and Nox2, and demonstrated genetically, that each is independently required for pathogenicity of M. grisea. Deltanox1 and Deltanox2 mutants are incapable of causing plant disease because of an inability to bring about appressorium-mediated cuticle penetration. The initiation of rice blast disease therefore requires production of superoxide by the invading pathogen.
17615239	A GeneTrek analysis of the maize genome.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Analysis of the sequences of 74 randomly selected BACs demonstrated that the maize nuclear genome contains approximately 37,000 candidate genes with homologues in other plant species. An additional approximately 5,500 predicted genes are severely truncated and probably pseudogenes. The distribution of genes is uneven, with approximately 30% of BACs containing no genes. BAC gene density varies from 0 to 7.9 per 100 kb, whereas most gene islands contain only one gene. The average number of genes per gene island is 1.7. Only 72% of these genes show collinearity with the rice genome. Particular LTR retrotransposon families (e.g., Gyma) are enriched on gene-free BACs, most of which do not come from pericentromeres or other large heterochromatic regions. Gene-containing BACs are relatively enriched in different families of LTR retrotransposons (e.g., Ji). Two major bursts of LTR retrotransposon activity in the last 2 million years are responsible for the large size of the maize genome, but only the more recent of these is well represented in gene-containing BACs, suggesting that LTR retrotransposons are more efficiently removed in these domains. The results demonstrate that sample sequencing and careful annotation of a few randomly selected BACs can provide a robust description of a complex plant genome.
17616579	Cellular cofactors affecting hepatitis C virus infection and replication.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates that are infectious in cell culture provide a genetic system to evaluate the significance of virus-host interactions for HCV replication. We have completed a systematic RNAi screen wherein siRNAs were designed that target 62 host genes encoding proteins that physically interact with HCV RNA or proteins or belong to cellular pathways thought to modulate HCV infection. This includes 10 host proteins that we identify in this study to bind HCV NS5A. siRNAs that target 26 of these host genes alter infectious HCV production >3-fold. Included in this set of 26 were siRNAs that target Dicer, a principal component of the RNAi silencing pathway. Contrary to the hypothesis that RNAi is an antiviral pathway in mammals, as has been reported for subgenomic HCV replicons, siRNAs that target Dicer inhibited HCV replication. Furthermore, siRNAs that target several other components of the RNAi pathway also inhibit HCV replication. MicroRNA profiling of human liver, human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells, and Huh-7.5 cells that harbor replicating HCV demonstrated that miR-122 is the predominant microRNA in each environment. miR-122 has been previously implicated in positively regulating the replication of HCV genotype 1 replicons. We find that 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide depletion of miR-122 also inhibits HCV genotype 2a replication and infectious virus production. Our data define 26 host genes that modulate HCV infection and indicate that the requirement for functional RNAi for HCV replication is dominant over any antiviral activity this pathway may exert against HCV.
17629420	Nature of selective constraints on synonymous codon usage of rice differs in GC-poor and GC-rich genes.	2007	Gene	Synonymous codon usage and cellular tRNA abundance are thought to be co-evolved in optimizing translational efficiencies in highly expressed genes. Here in this communication by taking the advantage of publicly available gene expression data of rice and Arabidopsis we demonstrated that tRNA gene copy number is not the only driving force favoring translational selection in all highly expressed genes of rice. We found that forces favoring translational selection differ between GC-rich and GC-poor classes of genes. Supporting our results we also showed that, in highly expressed genes of GC-poor class there is a perfect correspondence between majority of preferred codons and tRNA gene copy number that confers translational efficiencies to this group of genes. However, tRNA gene copy number is not fully consistent with models of translational selection in GC-rich group of genes, where constraints on mRNA secondary structure play a role to optimize codon usage in highly expressed genes.
17629421	Comparative study of SBP-box gene family in Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	Gene	SBP-box proteins are plant-specific putative transcription factors, which contain highly conserved SBP domain and could bind specifically to promoters of the floral meristem identity gene SQUAMOSA and its orthologous genes to regulate their expressions. In this study, 17 non-redundant SBP-box genes in Arabidopsis genome and 19 in rice genome were identified by using the known SBP domain sequences as queries. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the main characteristics of this family might have been in existence before the split of Arabidopsis and rice, and most SBP-box genes expanded in a species-specific manner after the split of monocotyledon and dicotyledon. All the SBP-box proteins were classified into 9 subgroups based on the phylogenetic tree, where each group shared similar motifs and the orders of the motifs in the same group were found almost identical. Analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates revealed that the SBP domain had gone through purifying selection, whereas some regions outside SBP domain had gone through positive or relaxed purifying selection. The expression patterns of the SBP-box genes were further investigated by searching against the EST database. Results showed that the Arabidopsis SBP-box genes are expressed chiefly in flowers, leaves, roots and seeds, while those in rice mainly in flowers and callus.
17631271	Identification of multiple highly similar XIP-type xylanase inhibitor genes in hexaploid wheat.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	In hexaploid wheat, Xip-I is the only XIP-type xylanase inhibitor gene whose expression and function have been characterized in detail. Here we demonstrate the existence of new XIP-type genes with the identification of Xip-R1 and Xip-R2 in the root cDNAs. Southern blot analysis with the Xip-R1 probe revealed that XIP-type genes comprised a significantly greater gene family than previously speculated on in studies with the Xip-I probe. The transcript level of Xip-R genes was increased upon an inoculation with Erysiphe graminis in the leaves, but not with Fusarium graminearum in the spikelets. RT-PCR with the RNA samples followed by extensive sequencing of the cloned amplified products revealed the presence of 12 highly similar Xip-R genes. Among these genes, Xip-R1 was the only predominant Xip-R family member induced to express in response to E. graminis. XIP-R1 was located in the apoplastic space and inhibited family 11 xylanases, but the protein did not show chitinolytic activity. These results suggest that hexaploid wheat has a large family of XIPs in its genome, but that only some of them are expressed for plant defense in limited tissues.
17681400	Chromium-mediated oxidative stress and ultrastructural changes in root cells of developing rice seedlings.	2007	J Plant Physiol	Oxidative stress and ultrastructural changes under hexavalent chromium stress were investigated in developing rice seedlings. Chromium treatment for 24 or 48h resulted in inhibition of root length and dry biomass. Atomic absorption spectrometry analysis of roots showed that chromium accumulation increased with increase in concentration and duration of metal treatment. Chromium resulted in increased production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical in root cells, which was a significant change after 48h of treatment. Time-course analysis of malondialdehyde content showed no substantial variation during early treatment periods (2, 6 or 12h). Increase in malondialdehyde content was observed only after 18h and it continued to increase until 48h after treatment. Loss of membrane integrity, analyzed in terms of Evans blue uptake in root cells, showed an increase in uptake of the reagent, indicating loss of membrane integrity. The antioxidant enzyme, viz., guaiacol peroxidase, was least affected, while glutathione reductase showed significant decline after 24 or 48h of metal treatment, followed by increased activity of superoxide dismutase. The level of ascorbate was not affected by chromium, while an increase in the level of glutathione was observed. At the ultrastructural level, potential damage to the root cell was noted after 48h at 100microM of chromium compared with controls.
17686457	A characterization of a MutM/Fpg ortholog in sugarcane--A monocot plant.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Plant genomic projects, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and maize, have provided excellent tools for comparative genome analysis on Base Excision DNA Repair (BER). A data-mining study associated with the SUCEST Genome project identified two EST clusters that shared homology to the bacteria MutM/Fpg protein. Comparative analyses presented here show a duplication of the MutM/Fpg gene in sugarcane, wheat and rice. The complementation assays show that both cDNAs from sugarcane are able to complement the Fpg and MutY-glycosylase deficiency in a double mutant Escherichia coli strain (CC104mutMmutY), reducing the spontaneous mutation frequency by 10-fold. The expression analyses by semi-quantitative RT-PCR show that these two mRNAs have different expression levels.
17689888	Comparative analysis of the SBP-box gene families in P. patens and seed plants.	2007	Gene	To come to a better understanding of the evolution and function of the SBP-box transcription factor family in plants, we identified, isolated and characterized 13 of its members from the moss Physcomitrella patens. For the majority of the moss SBP-box genes, clear orthologous relationships with family members of flowering plants could be established by phylogenetic analysis based on the conserved DNA-binding SBP-domain, as well as additional synapomorphic molecular characters. The P. patens SBP-box genes cluster in four separable groups. One of these consists exclusively of moss genes; the three others are shared with family members of Arabidopsis and rice. Besides the family defining DNA-binding SBP-domain, other features can be found conserved between moss and other plant SBP-domain proteins. An AHA-like motif conserved from the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to flowering plants, was found able to promote transcription in a heterologous yeast system. The conservation of a functional microRNA response element in the mRNA of three of the moss SBP-box genes supports the idea of an ancient origin of microRNA dependent regulation of SBP-box gene family members. As our current knowledge concerning the roles of SBP-box genes in plant development is scarce and the model system P. patens allows targeted mutation, the material we isolated and characterized will be helpful to generate the mutant phenotypes necessary to further elucidate these roles.
17698298	Three orthologs in rice, Arabidopsis, and Populus encoding starch branching enzymes (SBEs) are different from other SBE gene families in plants.	2007	Gene	Starch branching enzymes (SBEs) play important roles in plant starch synthesis. Three orthologs encoding SBEs in rice, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Populus trichocarpa are described. Putative amino acid sequences of these three SBE genes show approximately 30% identity to those of SBEI and SBEII from plants such as maize, barley, and wheat. More interestingly, they share approximately 31% amino acid sequence identity with those of glycogen-branching enzymes from such animals as mouse, horse, and monkey. The three genes have similar genomic structures, but their structural features are quite different from those of genes of both SBEI and SBEII families in plants. Based on phylogenetic analysis and genomic structure comparison, it is proposed that the three SBE genes represent a new family of SBEs.
17699623	Functions of OsBZR1 and 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signaling in rice.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Brassinosteroids (BR) are essential growth hormones found throughout the plant kingdom. BR bind to the receptor kinase BRI1 on the cell surface to activate a signal transduction pathway that regulates nuclear gene expression and plant growth. To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1-interacting proteins. Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice. Moreover, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified 14-3-3 proteins as OsBZR1-interacting proteins. Mutation of a putative 14-3-3-binding site of OsBZR1 abolished its interaction with the 14-3-3 proteins in yeast and in vivo. Such mutant OsBZR1 proteins suppressed the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis bri1-5 mutant and showed an increased nuclear distribution compared with the wild-type protein, suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins directly inhibit OsBZR1 function at least in part by reducing its nuclear localization. These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice.
17721507	The grapevine genome sequence suggests ancestral hexaploidization in major angiosperm phyla.	2007	Nature	The analysis of the first plant genomes provided unexpected evidence for genome duplication events in species that had previously been considered as true diploids on the basis of their genetics. These polyploidization events may have had important consequences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and adaptation and for the modulation of functional capacities. Here we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cultural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period. Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone recent genome duplication, thus enabling the discovery of ancestral traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants. This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is common to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome of rice, which is a monocotyledon. Furthermore, we explain the chronology of previously described whole-genome duplication events in the evolution of flowering plants.
17728010	Suppression and promotion of growth by ethylene in rice seedlings depends on ambient humidity.	2007	J Plant Physiol	We examined the effect of ethylene on the growth of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) at various degrees of humidity. Ethylene significantly suppressed the growth of shoots when applied to seedlings grown under 30% relative humidity (RH), but promoted the growth of shoots when applied to seedlings grown under 100% RH. The application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) promoted the elongation of shoots in seedlings grown under 30% and 100% RH. Ethylene inhibited the shoot elongation induced by GA(3) at 30% RH, but enhanced the elongation induced by GA(3) at 100% RH. These results indicate that ethylene can either promote or suppress the growth of rice shoots depending on ambient humidity, and that these actions of ethylene may be mediated through modulating the responsiveness of shoots to gibberellin.
17826739	Regulations of marker genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress by overexpression of the AtNDPK2 gene in rice.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	AtNDPK2 is involved in transcriptional regulation in response to pathogen and abiotic stresses. AtNDPK2-expressing transgenic rice plants showed regulation of the marker genes for chilling and oxidative stresses. In the present study, we produced AtNDPK2-overexpressing transgenic rice lines using the co-transformation method. Morphologically, the transgenic plants, compared with the control plants, were growth retarded. We investigated how AtNDPK2 overexpression influences the response of rice plants to marker genes related to chilling and ROS stress. The accumulation of transcripts of pBC442 and pBC601, related to chilling stress, was induced in AtNDPK2-overexpressed rice plants. On further investigation, we found that OsAPX1-, OsAPX2-, and OsSodB-scavenging free-oxygen radicals, such as superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), could be induced in AtNDPK2-overexpressed rice plants. In particular, transcripts encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins OsPR2 and OsPR4, as well as oxidative stress response proteins, were confirmed to change the gene expression in the transgenic rice plants. Together, these results suggest that AtNDPK2 plays a regulatory role in chilling and antioxidant signaling in plants.
17872948	Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster in rice for momilactones.	2007	J Biol Chem	Rice diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor and in rice leaves irradiated with UV light. The common substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate is converted into diterpene hydrocarbon precursors via a two-step sequential cyclization and then into the bioactive phytoalexins via several oxidation steps. It has been suggested that microsomal cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s) are involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons leading to the phytoalexins and that a dehydrogenase is involved in momilactone biosynthesis. However, none of the enzymes involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons have been identified. In this study, we found that a putative dehydrogenase gene (AK103462) and two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3) form a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV-inducible gene cluster, together with OsKS4 and OsCyc1, the diterpene cyclase genes involved in momilactone biosynthesis. Functional analysis by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli followed by enzyme assays demonstrated that the AK103462 protein catalyzes the conversion of 3beta-hydroxy-9betaH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6beta-olide into momilactone A. The double knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 specifically suppressed the elicitor-inducible production of momilactones, strongly suggesting that CYP99A2, CYP99A3, or both are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. These results provide strong evidence for the presence on chromosome 4 of a gene cluster involved in momilactone biosynthesis.
17881564	Improvement of water use efficiency in rice by expression of HARDY, an Arabidopsis drought and salt tolerance gene.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Freshwater is a limited and dwindling global resource; therefore, efficient water use is required for food crops that have high water demands, such as rice, or for the production of sustainable energy biomass. We show here that expression of the Arabidopsis HARDY (HRD) gene in rice improves water use efficiency, the ratio of biomass produced to the water used, by enhancing photosynthetic assimilation and reducing transpiration. These drought-tolerant, low-water-consuming rice plants exhibit increased shoot biomass under well irrigated conditions and an adaptive increase in root biomass under drought stress. The HRD gene, an AP2/ERF-like transcription factor, identified by a gain-of-function Arabidopsis mutant hrd-D having roots with enhanced strength, branching, and cortical cells, exhibits drought resistance and salt tolerance, accompanied by an enhancement in the expression of abiotic stress associated genes. HRD overexpression in Arabidopsis produces thicker leaves with more chloroplast-bearing mesophyll cells, and in rice, there is an increase in leaf biomass and bundle sheath cells that probably contributes to the enhanced photosynthesis assimilation and efficiency. The results exemplify application of a gene identified from the model plant Arabidopsis for the improvement of water use efficiency coincident with drought resistance in the crop plant rice.
17897620	Involvement of the osmosensor histidine kinase and osmotic stress-activated protein kinases in the regulation of secondary metabolism in Fusarium graminearum.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Fusarium graminearum produces trichothecenes in aerial hyphae, a process which is markedly suppressed by NaCl without a significant effect on fungal growth. Here we report on the involvement of kinases of the two-component osmotic signal transduction pathway in the regulation of secondary metabolism in F. graminearum. While a deletion null mutant of FgOs1 (encoding the osmosensor histidine kinase) (deltaFgOs1) produced a reduced amount of the red pigment aurofusarin and was unaltered in its ability to produce trichothecenes, deletion null mutants of FgOs4 (encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; MAPKKK), FgOs5 (MAPKK), and FgOs2 (MAPK) showed markedly enhanced pigmentation and failed to produce trichothecenes in aerial hyphae. Also, the transcript levels of PKS12 and GIP2 (aurofusarin biosynthetic pathway and regulatory genes, respectively) were significantly enhanced in the deltaFgOs4, deltaFgOs5, and deltaFgOs2 mutants and were reduced in the deltaFgOs1 mutant. In addition, expression of Tri4 and Tri6 (trichothecene biosynthetic pathway and regulatory genes) and production of trichothecenes in rice medium were markedly reduced in the former three protein kinase mutants. This is the first report demonstrating the involvement of a MAPK in the regulation of secondary metabolism.
17898767	Fire and flood management of coastal swamp enabled first rice paddy cultivation in east China.	2007	Nature	The adoption of cereal cultivation was one of the most important cultural processes in history, marking the transition from hunting and gathering by Mesolithic foragers to the food-producing economy of Neolithic farmers. In the Lower Yangtze region of China, a centre of rice domestication, the timing and system of initial rice cultivation remain unclear. Here we report detailed evidence from Kuahuqiao that reveals the precise cultural and environmental context of rice cultivation at this earliest known Neolithic site in eastern China, 7,700 calibrated years before present (cal. yr bp). Pollen, algal, fungal spore and micro-charcoal data from sediments demonstrate that these Neolithic communities selected lowland swamps for their rice cultivation and settlement, using fire to clear alder-dominated wetland scrub and prepare the site for occupation, then to maintain wet grassland vegetation of paddy type. Regular flooding by slightly brackish water was probably controlled by 'bunding' to maintain crop yields. The site's exploitation ceased when it was overwhelmed by marine inundation 7,550 cal. yr bp. Our results establish that rice cultivation began in coastal wetlands of eastern China, an ecosystem vulnerable to coastal change but of high fertility and productivity, attractions maximized for about two centuries by sustained high levels of cultural management of the environment.
17904519	In silico restriction landmark genome scanning analysis of Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae MAFF 311018.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	We have developed a restriction landmark genome scanning (RLGS) system in silico, involving two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of DNA by computer simulation that is based on the availability of whole-genome sequences for specific organisms. We applied the technique to the analysis of the Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae (Xoo) MAFF 311018, which causes bacterial blight in rice. The coverage that was found to be achievable using RLGS in silico, as a percentage of the genomic regions that could be detected, ranged from 44.5% to 72.7% per image. However, this reached a value of 96.7% using four images that were obtained with different combinations of landmark restriction enzymes. Interestingly, the signal intensity of some of the specific spots obtained was significantly lower than that of other surrounding spots when MboI, which cleaves unmethylated 5'-GATC-3' sites, was used. DNA gel blot analysis with both DNA adenine methylase (Dam)-sensitive and -insensitive isoschizomers (MboI and Sau3AI) revealed that Dam-mediated DNA adenine methylation had indeed occurred at these particular sites. These results suggest that a significant portion of the 5'-GATC-3' sites within the Xoo genome is stably methylated by Dam.
17922660	Interaction between ACC synthase 1 and 14-3-3 proteins in rice: a new insight.	2007	Biochemistry (Mosc)	In this study, the interaction between rice 14-3-3 protein and 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) was observed in yeast cells using yeast two-hybrid assays. Given the fact that 14-3-3 proteins generally bind to their target proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, a hypothesis regarding the regulatory role of 14-3-3 proteins in the activation of ACS is proposed in which 14-3-3 proteins may bind to the phosphorylated C-terminal tails of ACSs and help them to escape from their fated degradation when ethylene biosynthesis is needed. It is reasonable to believe that 14-3-3 protein may play an important role in regulating ACS activity.
17923480	Structural and functional characterization of the TRI101 trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase from Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium graminearum: kinetic insights to combating Fusarium head blight.	2008	J Biol Chem	Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a plant disease with serious economic and health impacts. It is caused by fungal species belonging to the genus Fusarium and the mycotoxins they produce. Although it has proved difficult to combat this disease, one strategy that has been examined is the introduction of an indigenous fungal protective gene into cereals such as wheat barley and rice. Thus far the gene of choice has been tri101 whose gene product catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the C3 hydroxyl moiety of several trichothecene mycotoxins. In vitro this has been shown to reduce the toxicity of the toxins by approximately 100-fold but has demonstrated limited resistance to FHB in transgenic cereal. To understand the molecular basis for the differences between in vitro and in vivo resistance the three-dimensional structures and kinetic properties of two TRI101 orthologs isolated from Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium graminearum have been determined. The kinetic results reveal important differences in activity of these enzymes toward B-type trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol. These differences in activity can be explained in part by the three-dimensional structures for the ternary complexes for both of these enzymes with coenzyme A and trichothecene mycotoxins. The structural and kinetic results together emphasize that the choice of an enzymatic resistance gene in transgenic crop protection strategies must take into account the kinetic profile of the selected protein.
17923667	Strategies for developing Green Super Rice.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	From a global viewpoint, a number of challenges need to be met for sustainable rice production: (i) increasingly severe occurrence of insects and diseases and indiscriminate pesticide applications; (ii) high pressure for yield increase and overuse of fertilizers; (iii) water shortage and increasingly frequent occurrence of drought; and (iv) extensive cultivation in marginal lands. A combination of approaches based on the recent advances in genomic research has been formulated to address these challenges, with the long-term goal to develop rice cultivars referred to as Green Super Rice. On the premise of continued yield increase and quality improvement, Green Super Rice should possess resistances to multiple insects and diseases, high nutrient efficiency, and drought resistance, promising to greatly reduce the consumption of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and water. Large efforts have been focused on identifying germplasms and discovering genes for resistance to diseases and insects, N- and P-use efficiency, drought resistance, grain quality, and yield. The approaches adopted include screening of germplasm collections and mutant libraries, gene discovery and identification, microarray analysis of differentially regulated genes under stressed conditions, and functional test of candidate genes by transgenic analysis. Genes for almost all of the traits have now been isolated in a global perspective and are gradually incorporated into genetic backgrounds of elite cultivars by molecular marker-assisted selection or transformation. It is anticipated that such strategies and efforts would eventually lead to the development of Green Super Rice.
17932040	In vitro synthesis of curcuminoids by type III polyketide synthase from Oryza sativa.	2007	J Biol Chem	Curcuminoids, major components of the spice turmeric, are used as a traditional Asian medicine and a food additive. Curcumin, a representative curcuminoid, has received a great deal of attention because of its anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor activities. Here we report a novel type III polyketide synthase named curcuminoid synthase from Oryza sativa, which synthesizes bisdemethoxycurcumin via a unique mechanism from two 4-coumaroyl-CoAs and one malonyl-CoA. The reaction begins with the thioesterification of the thiol moiety of Cys-174 by a starter molecule, 4-coumaroyl-CoA. Decarboxylative condensation of the first extender substrate, malonyl-CoA, onto the thioester of 4-coumarate results in the formation of a diketide-CoA intermediate. Subsequent hydrolysis of the intermediate yields a beta-keto acid, which in turn acts as the second extender substrate. The beta-keto acid is then joined to the Cys-174-bound 4-coumarate by decarboxylative condensation to form bisdemethoxycurcumin. This reaction violates the traditional head-to-tail model of polyketide assembly; the growing diketide intermediate is hydrolyzed to a beta-keto acid that subsequently serves as the second extender to form curcuminoids. Curcuminoid synthase appears to be capable of the synthesis of not only diarylheptanoids but also gingerol analogues, because it synthesized cinnamoyl(hexanoyl)methane, a putative intermediate of gingerol, from cinnamoyl-CoA and 3-oxo-octanoic acid.
17950698	Tandem duplications of a degenerated GTP-binding domain at the origin of GTPase receptors Toc159 and thylakoidal SRP.	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The evolutionary origin of some nuclear encoded proteins that translocate proteins across the chloroplast envelope remains unknown. Therefore, sequences of GTPase proteins constituting the Arabidopsis thaliana translocon at the outer membrane of chloroplast (atToc) complexes were analyzed by means of HCA. In particular, atToc159 and related proteins (atToc132, atToc120, and atToc90) do not have proven homologues of prokaryotic or eukaryotic ancestry. We established that the three domains commonly referred to as A, G, and M originate from the GTPase G domain, tandemly repeated, and probably evolving toward an unstructured conformation in the case of the A domain. It resulted from this study a putative common ancestor for these proteins and a new domain definition, in particular the splitting of A into three domains (A1, A2, and A3), has been proposed. The family of Toc159, previously containing A. thaliana and Pisum sativum, has been extended to Medicago truncatula and Populus trichocarpa and it has been revised for Oryza sativa. They have also been compared to GTPase subunits involved in the cpSRP system. A distant homology has been revealed among Toc and cpSRP GTP-hydrolyzing proteins of A. thaliana, and repetitions of a GTPase domain were also found in cpSRP protein receptors, by means of HCA analysis.
17961759	Promoter analysis of the rice stemar-13-ene synthase gene OsDTC2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S.	None	Biochim Biophys Acta	A rice diterpene cyclase, OsDTC2, functions as a stemar-13-ene synthase that converts syn-copalyl diphosphate into stemar-13-ene, a putative diterpene hydrocarbon precursor of the phytoalexin oryzalexin S. The transcriptional expression of OsDTC2 is induced by treatment of suspension-cultured rice cells with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the elicitor signaling pathway that leads to OsDTC2 expression, we carried out deletion and mutation analysis of the region -1939 bp upstream of the transcription start site of OsDTC2 in rice cells using dual luciferase assays. The region between -1709 and -1450 bp was found to contain six W-box motifs, which are putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements involved in elicitor-responsiveness and/or basic promoter activity of OsDTC2.
17961936	Expression pattern of inositol phosphate-related enzymes in rice (Oryza sativa L.): implications for the phytic acid biosynthetic pathway.	2007	Gene	Phytic acid, myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), is a storage form of phosphorus in plants. Despite many physiological investigations of phytic acid accumulation and storage, little is known at the molecular level about its biosynthetic pathway in plants. Recent work has suggested two pathways. One is an inositol lipid-independent pathway that occurs through the sequential phosphorylation of 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate (Ins(3)P). The second is a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated pathway, in which inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) is sequentially phosphorylated to InsP(6). We identified 12 genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.) that code for the enzymes that may be involved in the metabolism of inositol phosphates. These enzymes include 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS), inositol monophosphatase (IMP), inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate kinase/inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1), and inositol 1,3,4-triskisphosphate 5/6-kinase (ITP5/6K). The quantification of absolute amounts of mRNA by real-time RT-PCR revealed the unique expression patterns of these genes. Outstanding up-regulation of the four genes, a MIPS, an IPK1, and two ITP5/6Ks in embryos, suggested that they play a significant role in phytic acid biosynthesis and that the lipid-independent pathway was mainly active in developing seeds. On the other hand, the up-regulation of a MIPS, an IMP, an IPK2, and an ITP5/6K in anthers suggested that a PLC-mediated pathway was active in addition to a lipid-independent pathway in the anthers.
17988639	Generation of a transgenic rice seed-based edible vaccine against house dust mite allergy.	2008	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	As an alternative approach to conventional allergen-specific immunotherapy, transgenic rice seed expressing a major house dust mite (HDM) allergen, Der p 1, was developed as an edible vaccine. The C-terminal KDEL-tagged Der p 1 allergen specifically accumulated in seed endosperm tissue under the control of the endosperm-specific GluB1 promoter. Der p 1 reached a maximum concentration of 58 microg/grain and was deposited in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived protein body I (PB-I). Plant-derived Der p 1 was posttranslationally modified with high-mannose-type glycan structures. Glycosylated Der p 1 displayed reduced IgE binding capacity in comparison with its unglycosylated counterpart in vitro. Our results indicate that transgenic Der p 1 rice seeds are a safe, potential oral delivery vaccine for the treatment of HDM allergy.
18024592	Complexity of rice-water stool from patients with Vibrio cholerae plays a role in the transmission of infectious diarrhea.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	At the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, one-half of the rice-water stool samples that were culture-positive for Vibrio cholerae did not contain motile V. cholerae by standard darkfield microscopy and were defined as darkfield-negative (DF(-)). We evaluated the host and microbial factors associated with DF status, as well as the impact of DF status on transmission. Viable counts of V. cholerae in DF(-) stools were three logs lower than in DF(+) stools, although DF(-) and DF(+) stools had similar direct counts of V. cholerae by microscopy. In DF(-) samples, non-V. cholerae bacteria outnumbered V. cholerae 10:1. Lytic V. cholerae bacteriophage were present in 90% of DF(-) samples compared with 35% of DF(+) samples, suggesting that bacteriophage may limit culture-positive patients from producing DF(+) stools. V. cholerae in DF(-) and DF(+) samples were found both planktonically and in distinct nonplanktonic populations; the distribution of organisms between these compartments did not differ appreciably between DF(-) and DF(+) stools. This biology may impact transmission because epidemiological data suggested that household contacts of a DF(+) index case were at greater risk of infection with V. cholerae. We propose a model in which V. cholerae multiply in the small intestine to produce a fluid niche that is dominated by V. cholerae. If lytic phage are present, viable counts of V. cholerae drop, stools become DF(-), other microorganisms bloom, and cholera transmission is reduced.
18025467	The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to and tolerance of iron deficiency in plants.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Iron is essential for most living organisms and is often the major limiting nutrient for normal growth. Plants induce iron utilization systems under conditions of low iron availability, but the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation under iron deficiency remain largely unknown. We identified the rice transcription factor IDEF1, which specifically binds the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. IDEF1 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the plant-specific transcription factor family ABI3/VP1 and exhibits the sequence recognition property of efficiently binding to the CATGC sequence within IDE1. IDEF1 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing IDEF1 under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter transactivate IDE1-mediated expression only in iron-deficient roots. Transgenic rice plants expressing an introduced IDEF1 exhibit substantial tolerance to iron deficiency in both hydroponic culture and calcareous soil. IDEF1 overexpression leads to the enhanced expression of the iron deficiency-induced transcription factor gene OsIRO2, suggesting the presence of a sequential gene regulatory network. These findings reveal cis element/trans factor interactions that are functionally linked to the iron deficiency response. Manipulation of IDEF1 also provides another approach for producing crops tolerant of iron deficiency to enhance food and biomass production in calcareous soils.
18042708	The P2 capsid protein of the nonenveloped rice dwarf phytoreovirus induces membrane fusion in insect host cells.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Insect transmission is an essential process of infection for numerous plant and animal viruses. How an insect-transmissible plant virus enters an insect cell to initiate the infection cycle is poorly understood, especially for nonenveloped plant and animal viruses. The capsid protein P2 of rice dwarf virus (RDV), which is nonenveloped, is necessary for insect transmission. Here, we present evidence that P2 shares structural features with membrane-fusogenic proteins encoded by enveloped animal viruses. When RDV P2 was ectopically expressed and displayed on the surface of insect Spodoptera frugiperda cells, it induced membrane fusion characterized by syncytium formation at low pH. Mutational analyses identified the N-terminal and a heptad repeat as being critical for the membrane fusion-inducing activity. These results are corroborated with results from RDV-infected cells of the insect vector leafhopper. We propose that the RDV P2-induced membrane fusion plays a critical role in viral entry into insect cells. Our report that a plant viral protein can induce membrane fusion has broad significance in studying the mechanisms of virus entry into insect cells and insect transmission of nonenveloped plant and animal viruses.
18042724	CERK1, a LysM receptor kinase, is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) for the detection of various potential pathogens in innate immune systems of both plants and animals. We recently showed that chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP), plasma membrane glycoprotein with LysM motifs, functions as a cell surface receptor for chitin elicitor in rice. The predicted structure of CEBiP does not contain any intracellular domains, suggesting that an additional component(s) is required for signaling through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Here, we identified a receptor-like kinase, designated CERK1, which is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis. The KO mutants for CERK1 completely lost the ability to respond to the chitin elicitor, including MAPK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and gene expression. Disease resistance of the KO mutant against an incompatible fungus, Alternaria brassicicola, was partly impaired. Complementation with the WT CERK1 gene showed cerk1 mutations were responsible for the mutant phenotypes. CERK1 is a plasma membrane protein containing three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain with autophosphorylation/myelin basic protein kinase activity, suggesting that CERK1 plays a critical role in fungal MAMP perception in plants.
18079367	The Physcomitrella genome reveals evolutionary insights into the conquest of land by plants.	2008	Science	We report the draft genome sequence of the model moss Physcomitrella patens and compare its features with those of flowering plants, from which it is separated by more than 400 million years, and unicellular aquatic algae. This comparison reveals genomic changes concomitant with the evolutionary movement to land, including a general increase in gene family complexity; loss of genes associated with aquatic environments (e.g., flagellar arms); acquisition of genes for tolerating terrestrial stresses (e.g., variation in temperature and water availability); and the development of the auxin and abscisic acid signaling pathways for coordinating multicellular growth and dehydration response. The Physcomitrella genome provides a resource for phylogenetic inferences about gene function and for experimental analysis of plant processes through this plant's unique facility for reverse genetics.
18154307	Thermodynamic basis for the stabilities of three CutA1s from Pyrococcus horikoshii,Thermus thermophilus, and Oryza sativa, with unusually high denaturation temperatures.	2008	Biochemistry	In order to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of CutA1 from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhCutA1) with a denaturation temperature of nearly 150 degrees C, GuHCl denaturation and heat denaturation were examined at neutral and acidic pHs. As a comparison, CutA1 proteins from Thermus thermophilus (TtCutA1) and Oryza sativa (OsCutA1) were also examined, which have lower optimum growth temperatures of 75 and 28 degrees C, respectively, than that (98 degrees C) of P. horikoshii. GuHCl-induced unfolding and refolding curves of the three proteins showed hysteresis effects due to an unusually slow unfolding rate. The midpoints of refolding for PhCutA1, TtCutA1 and OsCutA1 were 5.7 M, 3.3 M, and 2.3 M GuHCl, respectively, at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. DSC experiments with TtCutA1 and OsCutA1 showed that the denaturation temperatures were remarkably high, 112.8 and 97.3 degrees C, respectively, at pH 7.0 and that the good heat reversibility was amenable to thermodynamic analyses. At acidic pH, TtCutA1 showed higher stability to both heat and denaturant than PhCutA1. Combined with the data for DSC and denaturant denaturation, the unfolding Gibbs energy of PhCutA1 could be depicted as a function of temperature. It was experimentally revealed that (1) the unusually high stability of PhCutA1 basically originates from a common trimer structure of the three proteins, (2) the stability of PhCutA1 is superior to those of the other two CutA1s over all temperatures above 0 degrees C at neutral pH, due to the decrease in both enthalpy and entropy, and (3) ion pairs of PhCutA1 contribute to the unusually high stability at neutral pH.
18155857	Molecular evolution of the MLO gene family in Oryza sativa and their functional divergence.	2008	Gene	The present study identified 12 MLO genes in rice that were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11 respectively without any obvious clustering. On a genome scale we showed that the expansion of rice MLO gene family was primarily attributed to segmental duplication produced by polyploidy, rather than through tandem amplification. Gene conversion events should also play important roles in the evolution of MLO genes. The results of relative rate ratio test and maximum likelihood analysis suggested that positive selection should have occurred after gene duplication and/or speciation, prompting the formation of distinct MLO subfamilies. Functional divergence analysis provided statistical evidence for shifted evolutionary rate after gene duplication. Compared to extracellular loop 3 and Ca(2+)-binding domain, much stronger functional constraints should impose on intracellular loop 2, although all of the three regions might be under purifying selection. The sliding window analysis of d(N)/d(S) ratio values identified one sequence region where strong functional constraints must impose on, and consequently should be crucial for functionality of MLO genes.
18287029	Discovery of a selective inhibitor of oncogenic B-Raf kinase with potent antimelanoma activity.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	BRAF(V600E) is the most frequent oncogenic protein kinase mutation known. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting "active" protein kinases have demonstrated significant utility in the therapeutic repertoire against cancer. Therefore, we pursued the development of specific kinase inhibitors targeting B-Raf, and the V600E allele in particular. By using a structure-guided discovery approach, a potent and selective inhibitor of active B-Raf has been discovered. PLX4720, a 7-azaindole derivative that inhibits B-Raf(V600E) with an IC(50) of 13 nM, defines a class of kinase inhibitor with marked selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays. PLX4720 preferentially inhibits the active B-Raf(V600E) kinase compared with a broad spectrum of other kinases, and potent cytotoxic effects are also exclusive to cells bearing the V600E allele. Consistent with the high degree of selectivity, ERK phosphorylation is potently inhibited by PLX4720 in B-Raf(V600E)-bearing tumor cell lines but not in cells lacking oncogenic B-Raf. In melanoma models, PLX4720 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis exclusively in B-Raf(V600E)-positive cells. In B-Raf(V600E)-dependent tumor xenograft models, orally dosed PLX4720 causes significant tumor growth delays, including tumor regressions, without evidence of toxicity. The work described here represents the entire discovery process, from initial identification through structural and biological studies in animal models to a promising therapeutic for testing in cancer patients bearing B-Raf(V600E)-driven tumors.
18291601	Retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in six rice genes and their evolutionary history.	2008	Gene	Retrotransposons are abundant in higher plant genomes. Although retrotransposons associated with plant genes have been identified, little is known about their evolutionary conservation at the level of species and subspecies. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic distribution of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertions in six genes in 95 cultivated and wild rice genotypes. These six genes are likely to be functional based on nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution ratios which were found to be significantly <1. Different conservation patterns of these retrotransposons in genes were observed in cultivated and wild rice species. Four out of seven retrotransposon insertions appear to predate the ancestral Oryza AA genome. Two of these insertions in genes 4 and 5 occurred early in the evolutionary history of Oryza. Two retrotransposon insertions in gene 1 arose after the divergence of Asian cultivated rice from its wild ancestor. Furthermore, the retrotransposon insertion in gene 3 appears to have occurred in the ancestral lineage leading to temperate japonicas. Conservation of retrotransposon insertions in genes in specific groups, species, and lineages might be related to their specific function.
18291602	Comprehensive sequence and expression profile analysis of PEX11 gene family in rice.	2008	Gene	PEX11 gene family has been shown to be involved in peroxisome biogenesis but very little is known about this gene family in rice. Here we show that five putative PEX11 genes (OsPEX11-1-5) present in rice genome and each contain three conserved motifs. The PEX11 sequences from rice and other species can be classified into three major groups. Among the five rice PEX11 genes, OsPEX11-2 and -3 are most likely duplicated. Expression profile and RT-PCR analysis suggested that the members of PEX11 family in rice had differential expression patterns: OsPEX11-1 and OsPEX11-4 had higher expression levels in leaf tissues than in the other tissues, OsPEX11-2 was detected only in germinated seeds, OsPEX11-3 was expressed predominantly in endosperm and germinated seeds, and OsPEX11-5 was expressed in all the tissues investigated. We also observed that the rice PEX11 genes had differential expression patterns under different abiotic stresses. OsPEX11-1 and OsPEX11-4 were induced by abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salt and low nitrogen stress conditions. OsPEX11-3 was responsive to ABA and H2O2 treatments, and OsPEX11-5 was responsive to ABA, H2O2, and salt treatments. However, OsPEX11-2 had no response to any of the stresses. Our results suggest that the rice PEX11 genes have diversification not only in sequences but also in expression patterns under normal and various stress conditions.
18303117	Microarray analyses reveal that plant mutagenesis may induce more transcriptomic changes than transgene insertion.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Controversy regarding genetically modified (GM) plants and their potential impact on human health contrasts with the tacit acceptance of other plants that were also modified, but not considered as GM products (e.g., varieties raised through conventional breeding such as mutagenesis). What is beyond the phenotype of these improved plants? Should mutagenized plants be treated differently from transgenics? We have evaluated the extent of transcriptome modification occurring during rice improvement through transgenesis versus mutation breeding. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression in four different pools of four types of rice plants and respective controls: (i) a gamma-irradiated stable mutant, (ii) the M1 generation of a 100-Gy gamma-irradiated plant, (iii) a stable transgenic plant obtained for production of an anticancer antibody, and (iv) the T1 generation of a transgenic plant produced aiming for abiotic stress improvement, and all of the unmodified original genotypes as controls. We found that the improvement of a plant variety through the acquisition of a new desired trait, using either mutagenesis or transgenesis, may cause stress and thus lead to an altered expression of untargeted genes. In all of the cases studied, the observed alteration was more extensive in mutagenized than in transgenic plants. We propose that the safety assessment of improved plant varieties should be carried out on a case-by-case basis and not simply restricted to foods obtained through genetic engineering.
18305171	Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Activity of axillary meristems dictates the architecture of both vegetative and reproductive parts of a plant. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot species, the transcription factor LFY confers a floral fate to new meristems arising from the periphery of the reproductive shoot apex. Diverse orthologous LFY genes regulate vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition when expressed in Arabidopsis, a property not shared by RFL, the homolog in the agronomically important grass, rice. We have characterized RFL by knockdown of its expression and by its ectopic overexpression in transgenic rice. We find that reduction in RFL expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering, with the extreme phenotype being no flowering. Conversely, RFL overexpression triggers precocious flowering. In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering. Aside from facilitating a transition of the main growth axis to an inflorescence meristem, RFL expression status affects vegetative axillary meristems and therefore regulates tillering. The unique spatially and temporally regulated RFL expression during the development of vegetative axillary bud (tiller) primordia and inflorescence branch primordia is therefore required to produce tillers and panicle branches, respectively. Our data provide mechanistic insights into a unique role for RFL in determining the typical rice plant architecture by regulating distinct downstream pathways. These results offer a means to alter rice flowering time and plant architecture by manipulating RFL-mediated pathways.
18353984	Genome-wide analysis for discovery of rice microRNAs reveals natural antisense microRNAs (nat-miRNAs).	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Small RNAs (21-24 nt) are involved in gene regulation through translation inhibition, mRNA cleavage, or directing chromatin modifications. In rice, currently approximately 240 microRNAs (miRNAs) have been annotated. We sequenced more than four million small RNAs from rice and identified another 24 miRNA genes. Among these, we found a unique class of miRNAs that derive from natural cis-antisense transcript pairs. This configuration generates miRNAs that can perfectly match their targets. We provide evidence that the miRNAs function by inducing mRNA cleavage in the middle of their complementary site. Their production requires Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) activity, which is essential for canonical miRNA biogenesis. All of the natural antisense miRNAs (nat-miRNAs) identified in this study have large introns in their precursors that appear critical for nat-miRNA evolution and for the formation of functional miRNA loci. These findings suggest that other natural cis-antisense loci with similar exon-intron arrangements could be another source of miRNA genes.
18362346	Mapping H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza risk in Southeast Asia.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus that emerged in southern China in the mid-1990s has in recent years evolved into the first HPAI panzootic. In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.
16208503	Marker-assisted selection to introgress rice QTLs controlling root traits into an Indian upland rice variety.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	A marker-assisted back-crossing (MABC) breeding programme was conducted to improve the root morphological traits, and thereby drought tolerance, of the Indian upland rice variety, Kalinga III. This variety, the recurrent parent in the MABC, had not previously been used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The donor parent was Azucena, an upland japonica variety from Philippines. Five segments on different chromosomes were targeted for introgression; four segments carried QTLs for improved root morphological traits (root length and thickness) and the fifth carried a recessive QTL for aroma. Some selection was made at non-target regions for recurrent parent alleles. We describe the selection made in three backcross (BC) generations and two further crosses between BC3 lines to pyramid (stack) all five target segments. Pyramids with four root QTLs were obtained in eight generations, completed in 6 years using 3,000 marker assays in a total of 323 lines. Twenty-two near-isogenic lines (NILs) were evaluated for root traits in five field experiments in Bangalore, India. The target segment on chromosome 9 (RM242-RM201) significantly increased root length under both irrigated and drought stress treatments, confirming that this root length QTL from Azucena functions in a novel genetic background. No significant effects on root length were found at the other four targets. Azucena alleles at the locus RM248 (below the target root QTL on chromosome 7) delayed flowering. Selection for the recurrent parent allele at this locus produced early-flowering NILs that were suited for upland environments in eastern India.
16311724	Fine genetic mapping fails to dissociate durable stem rust resistance gene Sr2 from pseudo-black chaff in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The broad-spectrum stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided protection in wheat against Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici for over 80 years. The Sr2 gene and an associated dark pigmentation trait, pseudo-black chaff (PBC), have previously been localized to the short arm of chromosome 3B. In a first step towards the positional-based cloning of Sr2, we constructed a high-resolution map of this region. The wheat EST (wEST) deletion bin mapping project provided tightly linked cDNA markers. The rice genome sequence was used to infer the putative gene order for orthologous wheat genes and provide additional markers once the syntenic interval in rice was identified. We used this approach to map six wESTs that were collinear with the physical order of the corresponding genes on rice chromosome 1 suggesting there are no major re-arrangements between wheat and rice in this region. We were unable to separate by recombination the tightly linked morphological trait, PBC from the stem rust resistance gene suggesting that either a single gene or two tightly linked genes control both traits.
16331476	Construction of introgression lines carrying wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) segments in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) background and characterization of introgressed segments associated with yield-related traits.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Introgression lines (ILs) are useful tools for precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the evaluation of gene action or interaction in theoretical studies. A set of 159 ILs carrying variant introgressed segments from Chinese common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), collected from Dongxiang county, Jiangxi Province, in the background of Indica cultivar (Oryza sativa L.), Guichao 2, was developed using 126 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) loci. The 159 ILs represented 67.5% of the genome of O. rufipogon. All the ILs have the proportions of the recurrent parent ranging from 92.4 to 99.9%, with an average of 97.4%. The average proportion of the donor genome for the BC(4)F(4) population was about 2.2%. The mean numbers of homozygous and heterozygous donor segments were 2 (ranging 0-8) and 1 (ranging 0-7), respectively, and the majority of these segments had sizes less than 10 cM. QTL analysis was conducted based on evaluation of yield-related traits of the 159 ILs at two sites, in Beijing and Hainan. For 6 out of 17 QTLs identified at two sites corresponding to three traits (panicles per plant, grains per panicle and filled grains per plant, respectively), the QTLs derived from O. rufipogon were usually associated with an improvement of the target trait, although the overall phenotypic characters of O. rufipogon were inferior to that of the recurrent parent. Of the 17 QTLs, 5 specific QTLs strongly associated with more than one trait were observed. Further analysis of the high-yielding and low-yielding ILs revealed that the high-yielding ILs contained relatively less introgressed segments than the low-yielding ILs, and that the yield increase or decrease was mainly due to the number of grain. On the other hand, low-yielding ILs contained more negative QTLs or disharmonious interactions between QTLs which masked trait-enchancing QTLs. These ILs will be useful in identifying the traits of yield, tolerance to low temperature and drought stress, and detecting favorable genes of common wild rice.
16365756	An integrated map of Oryza sativa L. chromosome 5.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The developments of molecular marker-based genetic linkage maps are now routine. Physical maps based on contigs of large insert genomic clones have been established in several plant species. However, integration of genetic, physical, and cytological maps is still a challenge for most plant species. Here we present an integrated map of rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosome 5, developed by fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones or PI-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones on meiotic pachytene chromosomes. Each BAC/PAC clone was anchored by a restriction fragment length polymorphism marker mapped to the rice genetic linkage map. This molecular cytogenetic map shows the genetic recombination and sequence information of a physical map, correlated to the cytological features of rice chromosome 5. Detailed comparisons of the distances between markers on genetic, cytological, and physical maps, revealed the distributions of recombination events and molecular organization of the chromosomal features of rice chromosome 5 at the pachytene stage. Discordance of distances between the markers was found among the different maps. Our results revealed that neither the recombination events nor the degree of chromatin condensation were evenly distributed along the entire length of chromosome 5. Detailed comparisons of the correlative positions of markers on the genetic, cytological, and physical maps of rice chromosome 5 provide insight into the molecular architecture of rice chromosome 5, in relation to its cytological features and recombination events on the genetic map. The prospective applications of such an integrated cytogenetic map are discussed.
16395568	A framework linkage map of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x transvaalensis) based on single-dose restriction fragments.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	This study describes the first detailed linkage maps of two bermudagrass species, Cynodon dactylon (T89) and Cynodon transvaalensis (T574), based on single-dose restriction fragments (SDRFs). The mapping population consisted of 113 F1 progeny of a cross between the two parents. Loci were generated using 179 bermudagrass genomic clones and 50 heterologous cDNAs from Pennisetum and rice. The map of T89 is based on 155 SDRFs and 17 double-dose restriction fragments on 35 linkage groups, with an average marker spacing of 15.3 cM. The map of T574 is based on 77 SDRF loci on 18 linkage groups with an average marker spacing of 16.5 cM. About 16 T89 linkage groups were arranged into four complete and eight into four incomplete homologous sets, while 15 T574 linkage groups were arranged into seven complete homologous sets, all on the basis of multi-locus probes and repulsion linkages. Eleven T89 and three T574 linkage groups remain unassigned. In each parent consensus maps were built based on alignments of homologous linkage groups. Four ancestral chromosomes were inferred after aligning T89 and T574 parental consensus maps using multi-locus probes. The inferred ancestral marker orders were used in comparisons to a detailed Sorghum linkage map using 40 common probes, and to the rice genome sequence using 98 significant BLAST hits, to find regions of colinearity. Using these maps we have estimated the recombinational length of the T89 and T574 genomes at 3,012 and 1,569 cM, respectively, which are 61 and 62% covered by our maps.
16432737	Mapping quantitative trait loci for yield components and morphological traits in an advanced backcross population between Oryza grandiglumis and the O. sativa japonica cultivar Hwaseongbyeo.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Introgression has been achieved from wild species Oryza grandiglumis (2n = 48, CCDD, Acc. No. 101154) into O. sativa subsp. japonica cv. Hwaseongbyeo as a recurrent parent. An advanced introgression (backcross) line, HG101, produced from a single plant from BC5F3 families resembled Hwaseongbyeo, but it showed differences from Hwaseongbyeo in several traits, including days to heading and culm length. To detect the introgressions, 450 microsatellite markers of known chromosomal position were used for the parental survey. Of the 450 markers, 51 (11.3%) detected O. grandiglumis segments in HG101. To characterize the effects of alien genes introgressed into HG101, an F(2:3) population (150 families) from the cross Hwaseongbyeo/HG101 was developed and evaluated for 13 agronomic traits. Several lines outperformed Hwaseongbyeo in several traits, including days to heading. Genotypes were determined for 150 F2 plants using simple sequence repeat markers. Qualitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was carried out to determine the relationship between marker genotype and the traits evaluated. A total of 39 QTL and 1 gene conferring resistance to blast isolate were identified using single-point analysis. Phenotypic variation associated with each QTL ranged from 4.2 to 30.5%. For 18 (46.2%) of the QTL identified in this study, the O. grandiglumis-derived alleles contributed a desirable agronomic effect despite the overall undesirable characteristics of the wild phenotype. Favorable wild alleles were detected for days to heading, spikelets per panicle, and grain shape traits. Grain shape QTL for grain weight, thickness, and width identified in the F(2:3) lines were further confirmed based on the F4 progeny test. The confirmed locus, tgw2 for grain weight is of particular interest because of its independence from undesirable height and maturity. Several QTL controlling amylose content and grain traits have not been detected in the previous QTL studies between Oryza cultivars, indicating potentially novel alleles from O. grandiglumis. The QTL detected in this study could be a rich source of natural genetic variation underlying the evolution and breeding of rice.
16432738	A microcolinearity study at the earliness per se gene Eps-A(m)1 region reveals an ancient duplication that preceded the wheat-rice divergence.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Wheat flowering is controlled by numerous genes, which respond to environmental signals such as photoperiod and vernalization. Earliness per se (Eps) genes control flowering time independently of these environmental cues and are responsible for the fine tuning of flowering time. We recently mapped the Eps-A(m)1 gene on the end of Triticum monococcum chromosome arm 1A(m)L. As a part of our efforts to clone Eps-A(m)1 we developed PCR markers flanking this gene within a 2.7 cM interval. We screened more than one thousand gametes with these markers and identified 27 lines with recombination between them. Recombinant lines were used to generate a high-density map and to investigate the microcolinearity between wheat and rice in this region. We mapped ten genes from a 149 kb region located at the distal part of rice chromosome 5 (cdo393 - Ndk3) on a 3.7 cM region on wheat chromosome one. This region is part of an ancient duplication between rice chromosomes 5 and 1. Genes present in both rice chromosomes were less similar to each other than to the closest wheat orthologues, suggesting that this duplication preceded the divergence between wheat and rice. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of 18 loci duplicated both in rice chromosomes 5 and 1 and in the colinear wheat chromosomes from homologous groups 1 and 3. Independent gene deletions in wheat and rice lineages explain the alternations of colinearity between rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosomes 1 and 3. Colinearity between the end of rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosome 1 was also interrupted by a small inversion, and several non-colinear genes. These results suggest that the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 1 was involved in numerous changes that differentiated wheat and rice genomes. This comparative study provided sufficient markers to saturate the Eps-A(m)1 gene region and to precisely map this gene within a 0.9 cM interval flanked by the VatpC and Smp loci.
16456656	Genomic analysis and marker development for the Tsn1 locus in wheat using bin-mapped ESTs and flanking BAC contigs.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The wheat Tsn1 gene confers sensitivity to the host-selective toxin Ptr ToxA produced by the tan spot fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis). The long-term goal of this research is to isolate Tsn1 using a positional cloning approach. Here, we evaluated 54 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) physically mapped to deletion bin 5BL 0.75-0.76, which is a gene-rich region containing Tsn1. Twenty-three EST loci were mapped as either PCR-based single-stranded conformational polymorphism or RFLP markers in a low-resolution wheat population. The genetic map corresponding to the 5BL 0.75-0.76 deletion bin spans 18.5 cM and contains 37 markers for a density of 2 markers/cM. The EST-based genetic map will be useful for tagging other genes, establishing colinearity with rice, and anchoring sequence ready BAC contigs of the 5BL 0.75-0.76 deletion bin. High-resolution mapping showed that EST-derived markers together with previously developed AFLP-derived markers delineated Tsn1 to a 0.8 cM interval. Flanking markers were used to screen the Langdon durum BAC library and contigs of 205 and 228 kb flanking Tsn1 were assembled, sequenced, and anchored to the genetic map. Recombination frequency averaged 760 kb/cM across the 228 kb contig, but no recombination was observed across the 205 kb contig resulting in an expected recombination frequency of more than 10 Mb/cM. Therefore, chromosome walking within the Tsn1 region may be difficult. However, the sequenced BACs allowed the identification of one microsatellite in each contig for which markers were developed and shown to be highly suitable for marker-assisted selection of Tsn1.
16463157	Molecular cytogenetics and DNA sequence analysis of an apomixis-linked BAC in Paspalum simplex reveal a non pericentromere location and partial microcolinearity with rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Apomixis in plants is a form of clonal reproduction through seeds. A BAC clone linked to apomictic reproduction in Paspalum simplex was used to locate the apomixis locus on meiotic chromosome preparations. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation revealed the existence of a single locus embedded in a heterochromatin-poor region not adjacent to the centromere. We report here for the first time information regarding the sequencing of a large DNA clone from the apomixis locus. The presence of two genes whose rice homologs were mapped on the telomeric part of the long arm of rice chromosome 12 confirmed the strong synteny between the apomixis locus of P. simplex with the related area of the rice genome at the map level. Comparative analysis of this region with rice as representative of a sexual species revealed large-scale rearrangements due to transposable elements and small-scale rearrangements due to deletions and single point mutations. Both types of rearrangements induced the loss of coding capacity of large portions of the "apomictic" genes compared to their rice homologs. Our results are discussed in relation to the use of rice genome data for positional cloning of apomixis genes and to the possible role of rearranged supernumerary genes in the apomictic process of P. simplex.
16477428	QTL analysis for rice grain length and fine mapping of an identified QTL with stable and major effects.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Grain length in rice plays an important role in determining rice appearance, milling, cooking and eating quality. In this study, the genetic basis of grain length was dissected into six main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and twelve pairs of epistatic QTLs. The stability of these QTLs was evaluated in four environments using an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between a Japonica variety, Asominori, and an Indica variety, IR24. Moreover, chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) harboring each of the six main-effect QTLs were used to evaluate gene action of QTLs across eight environments. A major QTL denoted as qGL-3a, was found to express stably not only in the isogenic background of Asominori but also in the recombinant background of Asominori and IR24 under multiple environments. The IR24 allele at qGL-3a has a positive effect on grain length. Based on the test of advanced backcross progenies, qGL-3a was dissected as a single Mendelian factor, i.e., long rice grain was controlled by a recessive gene gl-3. High-resolution genetic and physical maps were further constructed for fine mapping gl-3 by using 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers designed using sequence information from seven BAC/PAC clones and a BC4F2 population consisting of 2,068 individuals. Consequently, the gl-3 gene was narrowed down to a candidate genomic region of 87.5 kb long defined by SSR markers RMw357 and RMw353 on chromosome 3, which provides a basis for map-based cloning of this gene and for marker-aided QTL pyramiding in rice quality breeding.
16496119	Comparative transcriptome analyses of barley and rice under salt stress.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Although barley and rice belong to the same family Poaceae, they differ in their ability to tolerate salt stress. In an attempt to understand the molecular bases of such differences, we compared changes in transcriptome between barley and rice in response to salt stress using barley cDNA microarrays. At 1 and 24 h after salt stress, many genes were up-regulated in barley, but not in rice. Leaf water potential declined in the first 10 h of stress in both species, but recovered in the period 24-48 h only in barley. In addition, we found that barley partitioned Na+ to the roots and away from the shoots more efficiently than rice. These differences in physiological responses were correlated with the differences in the steady-state abundance of transcripts for the genes related to adaptive functions. Transcripts for plasma membrane protein 3 and inorganic pyrophosphatase were up-regulated in both species, but only transiently in rice. This indicates that adaptive mechanisms for regulating ion homeostasis are partly conserved in the two species, but it seems that rice cannot sustain cellular ion homeostasis for a long time like barley. These results imply that genetic modification of regulatory controls of early salt-responsive genes might lead to development of the salt tolerance trait in rice.
16501940	Candidate genes for barley mutants involved in plant architecture: an in silico approach.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	To individuate candidate genes (CGs) for a set of barley developmental mutants, a synteny approach comparing the genomes of barley and rice has been introduced. Based on map positions of mutants, sequenced RFLP markers linked to the target loci were selected. The markers were mapped in silico by BLAST searches against the rice genome sequence and chromosomal regions syntenous to barley target intervals were identified. Rice syntenous regions were defined for 15 barley chromosomal intervals hosting 23 mutant loci affecting plant height (brh1; brh2; sld4), shoot and inflorescence branching (als; brc1; cul-2, -3, -5, -15, -16; dub1; mnd6; vrs1), development of leaves (lig) and leaf-like organs (cal-b19, -C15, -d4; lks5; suKD-25; suKE-74; suKF-76; trd; trp). Annotation of 110 Mb of rice genomic sequence made it possible to screen for putative CGs which are listed together with the reasons supporting mutant-gene associations. For two loci, CGs were identified with a clear probability to represent the locus considered. These include FRIZZY PANICLE, a candidate for the brc1 barley mutant, and the rice ortholog of maize Liguleless1 (Lg1), a candidate for the barley lig locus on chromosome 2H. For this locus, the validity of the approach was supported by the PCR-amplification of a genomic fragment of the orthologous barley sequence. SNP mapping located this fragment on chromosome 2H in the region hosting the lig genetic locus.
16505997	Dissociation (Ds) constructs, mapped Ds launch pads and a transiently-expressed transposase system suitable for localized insertional mutagenesis in rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	We have developed a transiently-expressed transposase (TET)-mediated Dissociation (Ds) insertional mutagenesis system for generating stable insertion lines in rice which will allow localized mutagenesis of a chromosomal region. In this system, a Ds containing T-DNA construct was used to produce Ds launch pad lines. Callus tissues, from single-copy Ds/T-DNA lines, were then transiently infected with Agrobacterium harbouring an immobile Ac (iAc) construct, also containing a green fluorescent protein gene (sgfpS65T) as the visual marker. We have regenerated stable Ds insertion lines at a frequency of 9-13% using selection for Ds excision and GFP counter selection against iAc and nearly half of them were unique insertion lines. Double transformants (iAc/Ds) were also obtained and their progeny yielded approximately 10% stable insertion lines following excision and visual marker screening with 50% redundancy. In general, more than 50% of the Ds reinsertions were within 1 cM of the launch pad. We have produced a large number of single-copy Ds/T-DNA launch pads distributed over the rice chromosomes and have further refined the Ds/T-DNA construct to enrich for "clean" single-copy T-DNA insertions. The availability of single copy "clean" Ds/T-DNA launch pads will facilitate chromosomal region-directed insertion mutagenesis. This system provides an opportunity for distribution of gene tagging tasks among collaborating laboratories on the basis of chromosomal locations.
16783595	Dot-blot-SNP analysis for practical plant breeding and cultivar identification in rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	We report dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis to be applicable for practical plant breeding and cultivar identification. Competitive hybridization of a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide having the sequence of a mutant allele (or a wild-type allele) together with an unlabeled oligonucleotide having the sequence of a wild-type allele (or a mutant allele) was highly effective to reduce background signals in dot-blot hybridization. All 100 tested genes (200 alleles) in rice having SNPs or insertions/deletions were detected in an allele-specific manner. Genotypes of 43 rice cultivars were identified by this technique, and eight SNP markers were found to be sufficient for distinguishing all the cultivars from each other. Dot-blot analysis was also applied to genotyping of Wx and Sd1 of F4 plants in a conventional breeding program. Since dot-blot analysis with competitive hybridization provides a highly reliable, simple, and cost-effective technique for SNP analysis of a large number of samples, this technique is expected to realize the practical use of a novel breeding method, in which plants or breeding lines are selected by SNP analyses of many genes in a laboratory.
16791687	Extent and pattern of DNA methylation alteration in rice lines derived from introgressive hybridization of rice and Zizania latifolia Griseb.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	We have reported previously that introgression by Zizania latifolia resulted in extensive DNA methylation changes in the recipient rice genome, as detected by a set of pre-selected DNA segments. In this study, using the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) method, we globally assessed the extent and pattern of cytosine methylation alterations in three typical introgression lines relative to their rice parent at approximately 2,700 unbiased genomic loci each representing a recognition site cleaved by one or both of the isoschizomers, HpaII/MspI. Based on differential digestion by the isoschizomers, it is estimated that 15.9% of CCGG sites are either fully methylated at the internal Cs and/or hemi-methylated at the external Cs in the rice parental cultivar Matsumae. In comparison, a statistically significant increase in the overall level of both methylation types was detected in all three studied introgression lines (19.2, 18.6, 19.6%, respectively). Based on comparisons of MSAP profiles between the isoschizomers within the rice parent and between parent and the introgression lines, four major groups of MSAP banding patterns are recognized, which can be further divided into various subgroups as a result of inheritance of, or variation in, parental methylation patterns. The altered methylation patterns include hyper- and hypomethylation changes, as well as inter-conversion of hemi- to full-methylation, or vice versa, at the relevant CCGG site(s). Most alterations revealed by MSAP in low-copy loci can be validated by DNA gel blot analysis. The changed methylation patterns are uniform among randomly selected individuals for a given introgression line within or among selfed generations. Sequencing on 31 isolated fragments that showed different changing patterns in the introgression line(s) allowed their mapping onto variable regions on one or more of the 12 rice chromosomes. These segments include protein-coding genes, transposon/retrotransposons and sequences with no homology. Possible causes for the introgression-induced methylation changes and their implications for genome evolution and crop breeding are discussed.
16832648	Genetic characterization and fine mapping of the blast resistance locus Pigm(t) tightly linked to Pi2 and Pi9 in a broad-spectrum resistant Chinese variety.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance genes have been proven the most effective and economical approach to control rice blast disease. To understand the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, we conducted genetic and fine mapping analysis of the blast resistance gene in a Chinese rice variety: Gumei 4 (GM4) identified with broad-spectrum resistance and used in rice breeding for blast resistance for more than 20 years. Genetic and mapping analysis indicated that blast resistance to nine isolates of different Chinese races in GM4 was controlled by the same dominant locus designated as Pigm(t) that was finely mapped to an approximately 70-kb interval between markers C5483 and C0428 on chromosome 6, which contains five candidate NBS--LRR disease resistance genes. The allelism test showed that Pigm(t) was either tightly linked or allelic to Pi2 and Pi9, two known blast resistance genes. Mapping information also indicated that another blast resistance gene Pi26(t) might also be located at the same region. Candidate genes were identified by sequence analysis of the Nipponbare and Pi9 locus and the corresponding region in GM4. Sequence divergence of candidate genes was observed between GM4 and model varieties Nipponbare and 9311, and Pi9. Our current study provides essential information and new genetic resource for the cloning of functional resistance gene(s) and for marker-assisted selection in rice breeding for broad-spectrum blast resistance.
16838138	Pi35(t), a new gene conferring partial resistance to leaf blast in the rice cultivar Hokkai 188.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The japonica rice cultivar Hokkai 188 shows a high level of partial resistance to leaf blast. For mapping genes conferring the resistance, a set of 190 F2 progeny/F3 families was developed from the cross between the indica rice cultivar Danghang-Shali, with a low level of partial resistance, and Hokkai 188. Partial resistance to leaf blast in the F3 families was assessed in upland nurseries. From a primary microsatellite (SSR) linkage map and QTL analysis using a subset of 126 F2 progeny/F3 families randomly selected from the above set, one major QTL located on chromosome 1 was detected in the vicinity of SSR marker RM1216. This QTL was responsible for 69.4% of the phenotypic variation, and Hokkai 188 contributed the resistance allele. Segregation analysis in the F3 families for partial resistance to leaf blast was in agreement with the existence of a major gene, and the gene was designated as Pi35(t). Another QTL detected on chromosome 8 was minor, explained 13.4% of the phenotypic variation, and an allele of Danghang-Shali increased the level of resistance in this QTL. Additional SSR markers of the targeted Pi35(t) region were further surveyed in the 190 F2 plants, and Pi35(t) was placed in a 3.5-cM interval flanked by markers RM1216 and RM1003.
16847662	Inheritance of inflorescence architecture in sorghum.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The grass inflorescence is the primary food source for humanity, and has been repeatedly shaped by human selection during the domestication of different cereal crops. Of all major cultivated cereals, sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] shows the most striking variation in inflorescence architecture traits such as branch number and branch length, but the genetic basis of this variation is little understood. To study the inheritance of inflorescence architecture in sorghum, 119 recombinant inbred lines from an elite by exotic cross were grown in three environments and measured for 15 traits, including primary, secondary, and tertiary inflorescence branching. Eight characterized genes that are known to control inflorescence architecture in maize (Zea mays L.) and other grasses were mapped in sorghum. Two of these candidate genes, Dw3 and the sorghum ortholog of ramosa2, co-localized precisely with QTL of large effect for relevant traits. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using genomic and mutant resources from maize and rice (Oryza sativa L.) to investigate the inheritance of complex traits in related cereals.
16850313	Nucleotide diversity in starch synthase IIa and validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in relation to starch gelatinization temperature and other physicochemical properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The characteristics of starch, such as gelatinization temperature (GT), apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting temperature (PT) and other physicochemical properties, determine the quality of various products of rice, e.g., eating, cooking and processing qualities. The GT of rice flour is controlled by the alk locus, which has been co-mapped to the starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) locus. In this study, we sequenced a 2,051 bp DNA fragment spanning part of intron 6, exon 7, intron 7, exon 8 and part of 3' untranslated region of SSIIa for 30 rice varieties with diverse geographical distribution and variation in starch physicochemical properties. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one insertion/deletion (InDel) were identified, which could be classified into nine haplotypes. The mean pairwise nucleotide diversity pi was 0.00292, and Watterson's estimator theta was 0.00296 in this collection of rice germplasm. Tajima's D test for selection showed no significant deviation from the neutral expectation (D = - 0.04612, P > 0.10). However, significant associations were found between seven of the SNPs and peak GT (T (p)) at P < 0.05, of which two contiguous SNPs (GC/TT) showed a very strong association with T (p) (P < 0.0001). With some rare exception, this GC/TT polymorphism alone can differentiate rice varieties with high or intermediate GT (possessing the GC allele) from those with low GT (possessing the TT allele). In contrast, none of these SNPs or InDel was significantly associated with amylose content. A further 509 rice varieties with known physicochemical properties (e.g., AAC and PT) and known alleles of other starch synthesizing genes were genotyped for the SSIIa GC/TT alleles. Association analysis indicated that 82% of the total variation of AAC in these samples could be explained by a (CT)n simple sequence repeat (SSR) and a G/T SNP of Waxy gene (Wx), and 62.4% of the total variation of PT could be explained by the GC/TT polymorphism. An additional association analysis was performed between these molecular markers and the thermal and retrogradation properties for a subset of 245 samples from the 509 rice varieties. The SSIIa GC/TT polymorphism explained more than 60% of the total variation in thermal properties, whereas the SSR and SNP of Wx gene explained as much as the SSIIa GC/TT of the total variation in retrogradation properties. Our study provides further support for the utilization of the GC/TT polymorphism in SSIIa. As shown in our study of 509 rice varieties, the GC/TT SNP could differentiate rice with high or intermediate GT from those with low GT in about 90% of cases. Using four primers in a single PCR reaction, the GC/TT polymorphism can be surveyed on a large scale. Thus, this SNP polymorphism can be very useful in marker-assisted selection for the improvement of GT and other physicochemical properties of rice.
16850315	Fine mapping of a grain weight quantitative trait locus on rice chromosome 8 using near-isogenic lines derived from a cross between Oryza sativa and Oryza rufipogon.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for grain weight (GW) was detected near SSR marker RM210 on chromosome 8 in backcross populations derived from a cross between the Korean japonica cultivar Hwaseongbyeo and Oryza rufipogon (IRGC 105491). The O. rufipogon allele increased GW in the Hwaseongbyeo background despite the fact that O. rufipogon was the small-seeded parent. Using sister BC(3)F(3) near-isogenic lines (NILs), gw8.1 was validated and mapped to a 6.1 cM region in the interval between RM42 and RM210 (P < or = 0.0001). Substitution mapping with eight BC(3)F(4) sub-NILs further narrowed the interval containing gw8.1 to about 306.4 kb between markers RM23201.CNR151 and RM30000.CNR99. A yield trial using homozygous BC(3)F(4) sister sub-NILs and the Hwaseongbyeo recurrent parent indicated that the NIL carrying an O. rufipogon chromosome segment across the entire gw8.1 target region out-yielded its sister NIL (containing Hwaseongbyeo chromosome in the RM42-RM210 interval) by 9% (P=0.029). The higher-yielding NIL produced 19.3% more grain than the Hwaseongbyeo recurrent parent (P=0.018). Analysis of a BC(3)F(4) NIL indicated that the variation for GW is associated with variation in grain shape, specifically grain length. The locus, gw8.1 is of particular interest because of its independence from undesirable height and grain quality traits. SSR markers tightly linked to the GW QTL will facilitate cloning of the gene underlying this QTL as well as marker-assisted selection for variation in GW in an applied breeding program.
16874488	Assessing the importance of genotype x environment interaction for root traits in rice using a mapping population. I: a soil-filled box screen.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Altering root system architecture is considered a method of improving crop water and soil nutrient capture. The analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root traits has revealed inconsistency in the same population evaluated in different environments. It must be clarified if this is due to genotype x environment interaction or considerations of statistics if the value of QTLs for marker-assisted breeding is to be estimated. A modified split-plot design was used where a main plot corresponded to a separate experiment. The main plot factor had four treatments (environments), which were completely randomized among eight trials, so that each treatment was replicated twice. The sub-plot factor consisted of 168 recombinant inbreed lines of the Bala x Azucena rice mapping population, randomly allocated to the seven soil-filled boxes. The aim of the trial was to quantify QTL x environment interaction. The treatments were chosen to alter partitioning to roots; consisting of a control treatment (high-soil nitrogen, high light and high-water content) and further treatments where light, soil nitrogen or soil water was reduced singly. After 4 weeks growth, maximum root length (MRL), maximum root thickness, root mass below 50 cm, total plant dry mass (%), root mass and shoot length were measured. The treatments affected plant growth as predicted; low nitrogen and drought increased relative root partitioning, low-light decreased it. The parental varieties Bala and Azucena differed significantly for all traits. Broad-sense heritability of most traits was high (57-86%). Variation due to treatment was the most important influence on the variance, while genotype was next. Genotype x environment interaction was detected for all traits except MRL, although the proportion of variation due to this interaction was generally small. It is concluded that genotype x environment interaction is present but less important than genotypic variation. A companion paper presents QTL x environment analysis of data.
16896706	The barley serine/threonine kinase gene Rpg1 providing resistance to stem rust belongs to a gene family with five other members encoding kinase domains.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) resistance gene Rpg1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase with two tandem kinase domains. The Rpg1 gene family was identified from the cv. Morex and consists of five additional members with divergent homology to Rpg1. All family members encode serine/threonine kinase-like proteins with at least one predicted catalytically active kinase domain. The five family members were sequenced from cDNA and genomic DNA and genetically mapped. The family member most closely related to Rpg1, ABC1037, is located on chromosome 1(7H) bin 01, very near (approximately 50 kb) but not co-segregating with Rpg1. Two others, ABC1036 and ABC1040, are closely related to each other and tightly linked on chromosome 7(5H) bin 07. ABC1041 mapped to chromosome 7(5H) bin 13, tightly linked to the rust resistance genes rpg4 and Rpg5 providing resistance to barley stem rust pathotype QCC and rye stem rust pathotype 92-MN-90, respectively, but segregated away in a high-resolution population. ABC1063 was localized to chromosome 4(4H) bin 6. An interesting Rpg1 allele that appears to be the result of unequal recombination between Rpg1 and ABC1037 was characterized. No known resistance loci cosegregated with any family members, however characterization of the Rpg1 family has provided insight into the evolution of this novel gene family and may present tools for understanding the functional domains of Rpg1. The genetic mapping, gene structures, and analysis of amino-acid sequences of the Rpg1 gene family members are presented.
16896711	Development of simple sequence repeat markers specific for the Lr34 resistance region of wheat using sequence information from rice and Aegilops tauschii.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) originated about 8,000 years ago from the hybridization of tetraploid wheat with diploid Aegilops tauschii Coss. containing the D-genome. Thus, the bread wheat D-genome is evolutionary young and shows a low degree of polymorphism in the bread wheat gene pool. To increase marker density around the durable leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 located on chromosome 7DS, we used molecular information from the orthologous region in rice. Wheat expressed sequence tags (wESTs) were identified by homology with the rice genes in the interval of interest, but were monomorphic in the 'Arina' x 'Forno' mapping population. To derive new polymorphic markers, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones representing a total physical size of approximately 1 Mb and belonging to four contigs were isolated from Ae. tauschii by hybridization screening with wheat ESTs. Several BAC clones were low-pass sequenced, resulting in a total of approximately 560 kb of sequence. Ten microsatellite sequences were found, and three of them were polymorphic in our population and were genetically mapped close to Lr34. Comparative analysis of marker order revealed a large inversion between the rice genome and the wheat D-genome. The SWM10 microsatellite is closely linked to Lr34 and has the same allele in the three independent sources of Lr34: 'Frontana', 'Chinese Spring', and 'Forno', as well in most of the genotypes containing Lr34. Therefore, SWM10 is a highly useful marker to assist selection for Lr34 in breeding programs worldwide.
16896715	Assessing the importance of genotype x environment interaction for root traits in rice using a mapping population II: conventional QTL analysis.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Modifying plant root systems is considered a means of crop improvement targeted to low-resource environments, particularly low nutrient and drought-prone agriculture. The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root traits has stimulated marker-assisted breeding to this end, but different QTLs have been detected in different populations of the same species, and importantly, in the same population when grown in different experimental environments. The presence of QTL x environment interaction is implicated, and this must be characterised if the utility of the target QTLs is to be realised. Previous attempts to do this suffer from a lack of control over replicate environments and inadequate statistical rigour. The Bala x Azucena mapping population was grown in two replicate experiments of four treatment environments, a control, a low light, a low soil nitrogen and a low soil water treatment. After a 4 weeks growth, maximum root length, maximum root thickness, root mass below 50 cm, total plant dry mass, % root mass and shoot length were measured. A summary of the overall results is presented in an accompanying paper. Here, QTL analysis by composite interval mapping is presented. A total of 145 QTLs were detected, mapping to 37 discrete loci on all chromosomes. Superficial evidence of QTL x E (great difference in LOD score) was tested by single-marker analysis which confirmed QTL x E for five loci representing only five individual trait-loci interactions. Some loci appeared to be stable across environments. Some QTLs were clearly more or less active under low light, low nitrogen or drought. A few notable loci on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are briefly discussed. Also discussed are some remaining statistical shortcomings that will be addressed in another companion paper.
16964521	Microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms and a sequence tagged site in starch-synthesizing genes in relation to starch physicochemical properties in nonwaxy rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Starch characteristics determine the quality of various products of rice, e.g., eating, cooking and processing qualities. Our previous study indicated that molecular markers inside or close to starch synthesizing genes can differentiate the starch properties of 56 waxy rices. Here we report microsatellite (or simple sequence repeat, SSR) polymorphism in the Waxy (Wx) gene, soluble starch synthase I gene (SS1) and starch branching enzyme 1 gene (SBE1), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Wx and starch branching enzyme 3 gene (SBE3), and a sequence tagged site (STS) in starch branching enzyme 1 gene (SBE1) among 499 nonwaxy rice samples and their relationships with starch physicochemical properties. The nonwaxy rice samples consist of landraces (n = 172) obtained from germplasm centers and cultivars and breeding lines (n = 327) obtained from various breeding programs. Ten (CT)( n ) microsatellite alleles, (CT)(8), (CT)(10), (CT)(11), (CT)(12, )(CT)(17), (CT)(18), (CT)(19), (CT)(20), (CT)(21), and (CT)(22), were found at the Wx locus, of which (CT)(11) was the most frequent, and (CT)(12), (CT)(21) and (CT)(22) were identified for the first time. Four (CT)( n ) microsatellite alleles were found at the SBE1 locus, (CT)(8), (CT)(9), and (CT)(10 )together with an insertion sequence of CTCTCGGGCGA, and (CT)(8) alone without the insertion, of which (CT)(9) and the insertion was a new allele identified in only one rice, IR1552. Multiple microsatellites clustered at the SS1 locus, and in addition to the three alleles previously detected (SSS-A = (AC)(2)...TCC(TC)(11)...(TC)(5)C(ACC)(11), SSS-B = (AC)(3)...TCT(TC)(6)...(TC)(4)C(ACC)(9), and SSS-C = (AC)(3)...TCT(TC)(6)...(TC)(4)C(ACC)(8)), one new allele (SSS-D = (AC)(2)...TCC(TC)(10)...(TC)(4)C(ACC)(9)) was found. Analysis of the starch physicochemical properties of the samples with different microsatellites, SNPs and STS groups indicated that these molecular markers can differentiate almost all the physicochemical properties examined, e.g., apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting viscosity characteristics, and gel textural properties. Wx SSR and Wx SNP alone explained more variations for all physicochemical properties than the other molecular markers. The total six markers could explain 92.2, 81 and 86% of total variation of AAC, gel hardness (HD), and gel cohesiveness (COH), respectively, and they could explain more than 40% of the total variation of hot paste viscosity (HPV), cool paste viscosity (CPV), breakdown viscosity (BD), setback viscosity (SB) and gel adhesiveness (ADH). However, only 29% of the total variation of peak viscosity (PV) and 37% of pasting temperature (PT) could be explained by all the molecular markers. Some of these markers can differentiate the starch physicochemical properties among the rice samples with the same Wx allele, indicating that the variation within Wx allele classes can be explained by other starch synthesizing genes. These SSRs, SNPs and STS are useful in marker-assisted breeding for the improvement of starch quality of rice.
17136372	Genetic diversity analysis of traditional and improved Indonesian rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm using microsatellite markers.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	The archipelago of Indonesia has a long history of rice production across a broad range of rice-growing environments resulting in a diverse array of local Indonesian rice varieties. Although some have been incorporated into modern breeding programs, the vast majority of these landraces remain untapped. To better understand this rich source of genetic diversity we have characterized 330 rice accessions, including 246 Indonesian landraces and 63 Indonesian improved cultivars, using 30 fluorescently-labeled microsatellite markers. The landraces were selected across 21 provinces and include representatives of the classical subpopulations of cere, bulu, and gundil rices. A total of 394 alleles were detected at the 30 simple sequence repeat loci, with an average number of 13 alleles per locus across all accessions, and an average polymorphism information content value of 0.66. Genetic diversity analysis characterized the Indonesian landraces as 68% indica and 32% tropical japonica, with an indica gene diversity of 0.53 and a tropical japonica gene diversity of 0.56, and a Fst of 0.38 between the two groups. All of the improved varieties sampled were indica, and had an average gene diversity of 0.46. A set of high quality Indonesian varieties, including Rojolele, formed a separate cluster within the tropical japonicas. This germplasm presents a valuable source of diversity for future breeding and association mapping efforts.
17146664	Fine mapping of S32(t), a new gene causing hybrid embryo sac sterility in a Chinese landrace rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Ketan Nangka, the donor of wide compatibility genes, showed sterility when crossed to Tuanguzao, a landrace rice from Yunnan province, China. Genetic and cytological analyses revealed that the semi-sterility was primarily caused by partial abortion of the embryo sac. Genome-wide analysis of the linkage map constructed from the backcross population of Tuanguzao/Ketan Nangka//Ketan Nangka identified two independent loci responsible for the hybrid sterility located on chromosomes 2 and 5, which explained 18.6 and 20.1% of phenotypic variance, respectively. The gene on chromosome 5 mapped to the previously reported sterility gene S31(t), while the gene on chromosome 2, a new hybrid sterility gene, was tentatively designated as S32(t). The BC1F2 was developed for further confirmation and fine mapping of S32(t). The gene S32(t) was precisely mapped to the same region as that detected in the BC1F1 but its position was narrowed down to an interval of about 1.9 cM between markers RM236 and RM12475. By assaying the recombinant events in the BC1F2, S32(t) was further narrowed down to a 64 kb region on the same PAC clone. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed seven predicted open reading frames, four of which encoded known proteins and three encoded putative proteins. Further analyses showed that wide-compatibility variety Dular had neutral alleles at loci S31(t) and S32(t) that can overcome the sterilities caused by these two genes. These results are useful for map-based cloning of S32(t) and for marker-assisted transferring of the neutral allele in hybrid rice breeding.
17177062	Genetic variations in rice in vitro cultures at the EPSPs-RPS20 region.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	In vitro cultures of plant cells have often been utilized to generate genetic variations, which are designated somaclonal variations. Little is known about the major genetic alterations in the cultured cells and the nature of these genetic changes. Here, we examined different lines of rice Oc cells that have been cultured for more than 20 years on agar media or in liquid media. We surveyed 35 clones obtained from PCR amplification of the 3-kb EPSPs-RPS20 region. The sequence divergence among the Oc cells was even greater than that between Japonica and Indica rice cultivars. The divergent sequences appeared to be maintained as multiple copies in a single cell. Surprisingly, the nucleotide substitutions in the Oc cells were characterized by an extremely high frequency of transition mutations of A/T-to-G/C, a feature which is similar to that of the mutations caused by chemical mutagens such as 5-bromouracil and 2-aminopurine. Although no replacements in the exons of this region were observed among the AA-genome Oryza species, our results revealed that the nucleotide substitutions of the cultured cell lines occurred more frequently at replacement sites in the exons than at synonymous sites. These distinct mutation biases found in rice in vitro cultures might contribute importantly to somaclonal variations.
17219208	A 1,000-loci transcript map of the barley genome: new anchoring points for integrative grass genomics.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	An integrated barley transcript map (consensus map) comprising 1,032 expressed sequence tag (EST)-based markers (total 1,055 loci: 607 RFLP, 190 SSR, and 258 SNP), and 200 anchor markers from previously published data, has been generated by mapping in three doubled haploid (DH) populations. Between 107 and 179 EST-based markers were allocated to the seven individual barley linkage groups. The map covers 1118.3 cM with individual linkage groups ranging from 130 cM (chromosome 4H) to 199 cM (chromosome 3H), yielding an average marker interval distance of 0.9 cM. 475 EST-based markers showed a syntenic organisation to known colinear linkage groups of the rice genome, providing an extended insight into the status of barley/rice genome colinearity as well as ancient genome duplications predating the divergence of rice and barley. The presented barley transcript map is a valuable resource for targeted marker saturation and identification of candidate genes at agronomically important loci. It provides new anchor points for detailed studies in comparative grass genomics and will support future attempts towards the integration of genetic and physical mapping information.
17219209	Generation and characterization of low phytic acid germplasm in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate), or its salt form, phytate, is commonly regarded as the major anti-nutritional component in cereal and legume grains. Breeding of low phytic acid (lpa) crops has recently been considered as a potential way to increase nutritional quality of crop products. In this study, eight independent lpa rice mutant lines from both indica and japonica subspecies were developed through physical and chemical mutagenesis. Among them, five are non-lethal while the other three are homozygous lethal. None of the lethal lines could produce homozygous lpa plants through seed germination and growth under field conditions, but two of them could be rescued through in vitro culture of mature embryos. The non-lethal lpa mutants had lower PA content ranging from 34 to 64% that of their corresponding parent and four of them had an unchanged total P level. All the lpa mutations were inherited in a single recessive gene model and at least four lpa mutations were identified mutually non-allelic, while the other two remain to be verified. One mutation was mapped on chromosome 2 between microsatellite locus RM3542 and RM482, falling in the same region as the previously mapped lpa1-1 locus did; another lpa mutation was mapped on chromosome 3, tightly linked to RM3199 with a genetic distance of 1.198 cM. The latter mutation was very likely to have happened to the LOC_Os03g52760, a homolog of the maize myo-inositol kinase (EC 2.7.1.64) gene. The present work greatly expands the number of loci that could influence the biosynthesis of PA in rice, making rice an excellent model system for research in this area.
17279367	Fine mapping of pss1, a pollen semi-sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	During routine seed increase procedures in rice, semi-sterile plants are common; however, such semi-sterility mutants in rice varieties have been only rarely analyzed genetically. W207-2 is a semi-sterile selection from the japonica rice variety Nipponbare. In this report, we found the female gamete of W207-2 was normal, and its semi-sterility was unaffected by growth duration but was conditioned by a recessive nuclear gene whose action leads to pollen semi-sterility and anther indehiscence, and the gene was named as pss1 (pollen semi-sterile). Using an F(2) population derived from the two parents W207-2 and Dular and a pooled DNA strategy, pss1 was mapped to an interval on chromosome 8 defined by the two SSR loci RM6356 and RS41. The position of pss1 was confirmed in another F(2) population derived from the cross W207-2 x Nipponbare. Over 2,000 homozygous pss1 segregants from the large W207-2 x Dular F(2) population were used to fine map pss1 to a 0.04 cM segment flanked by a CAPs marker L2 and a dCAPs L3 marker. Sequences for both markers are present on a single PAC clone, and the physical distance between them is about 28 kb. Analysis of the PAC sequence predicts the presence of five open reading frames, they are as follows: putative ribonuclease PH, putative avr9 elicitor response protein, kinesin1-like protein, putative protein RNP-D precursor and putative 40S ribosomal protein S13. This result would be helpful in cloning the pss1 gene.
17287976	Two novel loci for pollen sterility in hybrids between the weedy strain Ludao and the Japonica variety Akihikari of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Partial pollen sterility has been observed in hybrid progeny derived from a japonica cultivar, Akihikari and a weedy strain, Ludao, which naturally grows in Jiangsu province of east China. Cytological and histological analyses revealed that pollen abortion occurred largely at the bicellular pollen stage, primarily due to the gradual disaggregation of generative and vegetative cells. A genome-wide analysis was further carried out in a backcross population of Akihikari //Ludao/Akihikari using a total of 118 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and an expressed sequence tag (EST) marker distributed on the entire rice linkage map. Two loci controlling hybrid pollen sterility, designated as S33(t) and S34(t), were located on chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. Both loci were putatively different from all the previously reported gametophyte genes and hybrid pollen sterility loci. Interaction between the Ludao and Akihikari alleles at each of the two loci resulted in reduction of fertility in the pollens carring the Ludao alleles. To map the precise location of the major locus, S33(t), we selected 165 plants of the backcross population with pollen fertility higher than 80.0%, and assayed the recombinant events surrounding the S33(t) locus using newly developed SSR markers. The S33(t) was delimited to an 86 kb region between SSR markers RM15621 and RM15627. Sequence analysis of this region indicated that there were ten open reading frames. These results will be valuable for cloning this gene and marker-assisted transferring of the corresponding neutral allele in rice breeding programs. Furthermore, the origin of the weedy strain Ludao is discussed.
17356864	Bayesian association mapping of multiple quantitative trait loci and its application to the analysis of genetic variation among Oryza sativa L. germplasms.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	One way to use a crop germplasm collection directly to map QTLs without using line-crossing experiments is the whole genome association mapping. A major problem with association mapping is the presence of population structure, which can lead to both false positives and failure to detect genuine associations (i.e., false negatives). Particularly in highly selfing species such as Asian cultivated rice, high levels of population structure are expected and therefore the efficiency of association mapping remains almost unknown. Here, we propose an approach that combines a Bayesian method for mapping multiple QTLs with a regression method that directly incorporates estimates of population structure. That is, the effects due to both multiple QTLs and population structure were included in our statistical model. We evaluated the efficiency of our approach in simulated- and real-trait analyses of a rice germplasm collection. Simulation analyses based on real marker data showed that our model could suppress both false-positive and false-negative rates and the error of estimation of genetic effects over single QTL models, indicating that our model has statistically desirable attributes over single QTL models. As real traits, we analyzed the size and shape of milled rice grains and found significant markers that may be linked to QTLs reported previously. Association mapping should have good prospects in highly selfing species such as rice if proper methods are adopted. Our approach will be useful for the whole genome association mapping of various selfing crop species.
17375281	Analysis of the barley chromosome 2 region containing the six-rowed spike gene vrs1 reveals a breakdown of rice-barley micro collinearity by a transposition.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	In cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare), six-rowed spikes produce three times as many seeds per spike as do two-rowed spikes. The determinant of this trait is the Mendelian gene vrs1, located on chromosome 2H, which is syntenous with rice (Oryza sativa) chromosomes 4 and 7. We exploited barley-rice micro-synteny to increase marker density in the vrs1 region as a prelude to its map-based cloning. The rice genomic sequence, covering a 980 kb contig, identified barley ESTs linked to vrs1. A high level of conservation of gene sequence was obtained between barley chromosome 2H and rice chromosome 4. A total of 22 EST-based STS markers were placed within the target region, and the linear order of these markers in barley and rice was identical. The genetic window containing vrs1 was narrowed from 0.5 to 0.06 cM, which facilitated covering the vrs1 region by a 518 kb barley BAC contig. An analysis of the contig sequence revealed that a rice Vrs1 orthologue is present on chromosome 7, suggesting a transposition of the chromosomal segment containing Vrs1 within barley chromosome 2H. The breakdown of micro-collinearity illustrates the limitations of synteny cloning, and stresses the importance of implementing genomic studies directly in the target species.
17406851	Accumulation of additive effects generates a strong photoperiod sensitivity in the extremely late-heading rice cultivar 'Nona Bokra'.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Many rice cultivars that originated from lower-latitude regions exhibit a strong photoperiod sensitivity (PS) and show extremely late heading under long-day conditions. Under natural day-length conditions during the cropping season in Japan, the indica rice cultivar 'Nona Bokra' from India showed extremely late heading (202 days to heading) compared to the japonica cultivar 'Koshihikari' (105 days), from Japan. To elucidate the genetic factors associated with such extremely late heading, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of heading date using an F(2) population and seven advanced backcross progeny (one BC(1)F(2) and six BC(2)F(2)) derived from a cross between 'Nona Bokra' and 'Koshihikari'. The analyses revealed 12 QTLs on seven chromosomes. The 'Nona Bokra' alleles of all QTLs contributed to an increase in heading date. Digenic interactions were rarely observed between QTLs. Based on the genetic parameters of the QTLs, such as additive effects and percentage of phenotypic variance explained, these 12 QTLs are likely generate a large proportion of the phenotypic variation observed in the heading dates between 'Nona Bokra' and 'Koshihikari'. Comparison of chromosomal locations between heading date QTLs detected in this study and QTLs previously identified in 'Nipponbare' x 'Kasalath' populations revealed that eight of the heading date QTLs were recognized nearby the Hd1, Hd2, Hd3a, Hd4, Hd5, Hd6, Hd9, and Hd13. These results suggest that the strong PS in 'Nona Bokra' was generated mainly by the accumulation of additive effects of particular alleles at previously identified QTLs.
17479243	Application of identified QTL-marker associations in rice quality improvement through a design-breeding approach.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	A permanent mapping population of rice consisting of 65 non-idealized chromosome segment substitution lines (denoted as CSSL1 to CSSL65) and 82 donor parent chromosome segments (denoted as M1 to M82) was used to identify QTL with additive effects for two rice quality traits, area of chalky endosperm (ACE) and amylose content (AC), by a likelihood ratio test based on stepwise regression. Subsequently, the genetics and breeding simulation tool QuLine was employed to demonstrate the application of the identified QTL in rice quality improvement. When a LOD threshold of 2.0 was used, a total of 16 chromosome segments were associated with QTL for ACE, and a total of 15 segments with QTL for AC in at least one environment. Four target genotypes denoted as DG1 to DG4 were designed based on the identified QTL, and according to low ACE and high AC breeding objectives. Target genotypes DG1 and DG2 can be achieved via a topcross (TC) among the three lines CSSL4, CSSL28, and CSSL49. Results revealed that TC2: (CSSL4 x CSSL49) x CSSL28 and TC3: (CSSL28 x CSSL49) x CSSL4 resulted in higher DG1 frequency in their doubled haploid populations, whereas TC1: (CSSL4 x CSSL28) x CSSL49 resulted in the highest DG2 frequency. Target genotypes DG3 and DG4 can be developed by a double cross among the four lines CSSL4, CSSL28, CSSL49, and CSSL52. In a double cross, the order of parents affects the frequency of target genotype to be selected. Results suggested that the double cross between the two single crosses (CSSL4 x CSSL28) and (CSSL49 x CSSL52) resulted in the highest frequency for DG3 and DG4 genotypes in its derived doubled haploid derivatives. Using an enhancement selection methodology, alternative ways were investigated to increase the target genotype frequency without significantly increasing the total cost of breeding operations.
17486310	Identification and linkage mapping of complementary recessive genes causing hybrid breakdown in an intraspecific rice cross.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	One outcome of hybrid breakdown is poor growth, which we observed as a reduction in the number of panicles per plant and in culm length in an F(2) population derived from a cross between the genetically divergent rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars 'Sasanishiki' (japonica) and 'Habataki' (indica). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the two traits and two-way ANOVA of the detected QTLs suggested that the poor growth was due mainly to an epistatic interaction between genes at QTLs located on chromosomes 2 and 11. The poor growth was likely to result when a plant was homozygous for the 'Habataki' allele at the QTL on chromosome 2 and homozygous for the 'Sasanishiki' allele at the QTL on chromosome 11. The results suggest that the poor growth found in the F(2) population was due to hybrid breakdown of a set of complementary genes. To test this hypothesis and determine the precise chromosomal location of the genes causing the hybrid breakdown, we performed genetic analyses using a chromosome segment substitution line, in which a part of chromosome 2 from 'Habataki' was substituted into the genetic background of 'Sasanishiki'. The segregation patterns of poor growth in plants suggested that both of the genes underlying the hybrid breakdown were recessive. The gene on chromosome 2, designated hybrid breakdown 2 (hbd2), was mapped between simple sequence repeat markers RM3515 and RM3730. The gene on chromosome 11, hbd3, was mapped between RM5824 and RM1341.
17487470	Interaction of two recessive genes, hbd2 and hbd3, induces hybrid breakdown in rice.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Reproductive barriers are important for the maintenance of species identity. We discovered a reproductive barrier via hybrid breakdown among the progeny of a cross between the japonica rice cultivar Koshihikari and the indica rice cultivar Habataki. Genetic analysis indicated that the hybrid breakdown is regulated by the interaction of two recessive genes: hbd2 in Habataki and hbd3 in Koshihikari. Linkage mapping showed that hbd2 is located near the 100 cM region of chromosome 2 in Habataki, whereas hbd3 is located near the 60 cM region of chromosome 11 in Koshihikari. Construction of nearly isogenic lines for hbd2 and Hbd3 (NIL-hbd2 and NIL-Hbd3), as well as a pyramiding line (NIL-hbd2 + Hbd3), confirmed that the hybrid breakdown is induced by the interaction of these two recessive genes. Our results indicate that these genes are novel for the induction of hybrid breakdown in rice.
17492423	A novel wx mutation caused by insertion of a retrotransposon-like sequence in a glutinous cultivar of rice (Oryza sativa).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	DNA polymorphism of the Wx gene in glutinous rice cultivars was investigated by PCR-RF-SSCP and heteroduplex cleavage analysis using Brassica petiole extract, and the nucleotide sequence variations were identified. Most japonica-type glutinous rice was found to have a 23-bp duplication in the second exon, which causes loss of the function of granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) encoded by the Wx gene. Without the 23-bp duplication, there was an insertion of 7,764 bp in the ninth exon of the wx allele of 'Oragamochi'. Expression analysis of the wx allele using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed that transcripts of the 'Oragamochi' wx allele are about 1-kb shorter and that the deduced amino acid sequence of the transcript lacks a motif important for GBSS. Therefore, this insertion was considered to be the cause of the glutinous trait of 'Oragamochi'. This 7,764-bp insertion had long terminal repeats, a primer binding site, and a polypurine tract, but no sequence homologous with gag and pol, suggesting that it is a non-autonomous element. Furthermore, it had a structure similar to Dasheng and may be a member of Dasheng.
17522835	Leveraging the rice genome sequence for monocot comparative and translational genomics.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Common genome anchor points across many taxa greatly facilitate translational and comparative genomics and will improve our understanding of the Tree of Life. To add to the repertoire of genomic tools applicable to the study of monocotyledonous plants in general, we aligned Allium and Musa ESTs to Oryza BAC sequences and identified candidate Allium-Oryza and Musa-Oryza conserved intron-scanning primers (CISPs). A random sampling of 96 CISP primer pairs, representing loci from 11 of the 12 chromosomes in rice, were tested on seven members of the order Poales and on representatives of the Arecales, Asparagales, and Zingiberales monocot orders. The single-copy amplification success rates of Allium (31.3%), Cynodon (31.4%), Hordeum (30.2%), Musa (37.5%), Oryza (61.5%), Pennisetum (33.3%), Sorghum (47.9%), Zea (33.3%), Triticum (30.2%), and representatives of the palm family (32.3%) suggest that subsets of these primers will provide DNA markers suitable for comparative and translational genomics in orphan crops, as well as for applications in conservation biology, ecology, invasion biology, population biology, systematic biology, and related fields.
17534593	Complete chloroplast genome sequences of Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor and Agrostis stolonifera, and comparative analyses with other grass genomes.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Comparisons of complete chloroplast genome sequences of Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor and Agrostis stolonifera to six published grass chloroplast genomes reveal that gene content and order are similar but two microstructural changes have occurred. First, the expansion of the IR at the SSC/IRa boundary that duplicates a portion of the 5' end of ndhH is restricted to the three genera of the subfamily Pooideae (Agrostis, Hordeum and Triticum). Second, a 6 bp deletion in ndhK is shared by Agrostis, Hordeum, Oryza and Triticum, and this event supports the sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae. Repeat analysis identified 19-37 direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 90%. Seventeen of the 26 shared repeats are found in all the grass chloroplast genomes examined and are located in the same genes or intergenic spacer (IGS) regions. Examination of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified 16-21 potential polymorphic SSRs. Five IGS regions have 100% sequence identity among Zea mays, Saccharum officinarum and Sorghum bicolor, whereas no spacer regions were identical among Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, H. vulgare and A. stolonifera despite their close phylogenetic relationship. Alignment of EST sequences and DNA coding sequences identified six C-U conversions in both Sorghum bicolor and H. vulgare but only one in A. stolonifera. Phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of 61 protein-coding genes of 38 taxa using both maximum parsimony and likelihood methods provide moderate support for a sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae.
17534594	Mapping QTLs with digenic epistasis under multiple environments and predicting heterosis based on QTL effects.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Mixed linear model approach was proposed for mapping QTLs with the digenic epistasis and QTL by environment (QE) interaction as well as additive and dominant effects. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the proposed method could provide unbiased estimations for both positions and genetic main effects of QTLs, as well as unbiased predictions for QE interaction effects. A method was suggested for predicting heterosis based on individual QTL effects. The immortalized F(2) (IF(2)) population constructed by random mating among RI or DH lines is appropriate for mapping QTLs with epistasis and their QE interaction. Based on the models and methodology proposed, we developed a QTL mapping software, QTLMapper 2.0 on the basis of QTLmapper 1.0, which is suitable for analyzing populations of DH, RIL, F(2) and IF(2). Data of thousand grain weight of IF(2) population with 240 lines derived from elite hybrid rice Shanyou 63 were analyzed as a worked example.
17551710	High-resolution mapping of the Alp locus and identification of a candidate gene HvMATE controlling aluminium tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Aluminium (Al) tolerance in barley is conditioned by the Alp locus on the long arm of chromosome 4H, which is associated with Al-activated release of citrate from roots. We developed a high-resolution map of the Alp locus using 132 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross between Dayton (Al-tolerant) and Zhepi 2 (Al-sensitive) and 2,070 F(2 )individuals from a cross between Dayton and Gairdner (Al-sensitive). The Al-activated efflux of citrate from the root apices of Al-tolerant Dayton was 10-fold greater than from the Al-sensitive parents Zhepi 2 and Gairdner. A suite of markers (ABG715, Bmag353, GBM1071, GWM165, HvMATE and HvGABP) exhibited complete linkage with the Alp locus in the DH population accounting 72% of the variation for Al tolerance evaluated as relative root elongation. These markers were used to map this genomic region in the Dayton/Gairdner population in more detail. Flanking markers HvGABP and ABG715 delineated the Alp locus to a 0.2 cM interval. Since the HvMATE marker was not polymorphic in the Dayton/Gairdner population we instead investigated the expression of the HvMATE gene. Relative expression of the HvMATE gene was 30-fold greater in Dayton than Gardiner. Furthermore, HvMATE expression in the F(2:3) families tested, including all the informative recombinant lines identified between HvGABP and ABG715 was significantly correlated with Al tolerance and Al-activated citrate efflux. These results identify HvMATE, a gene encoding a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion protein, as a candidate controlling Al tolerance in barley.
17571251	Fine mapping and targeted SNP survey using rice-wheat gene colinearity in the region of the Bo1 boron toxicity tolerance locus of bread wheat.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Toxicity due to high levels of soil boron (B) represents a significant limitation to cereal production in some regions, and the Bo1 gene provides a major source of B toxicity tolerance in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A novel approach was used to develop primers to amplify and sequence gene fragments specifically from the Bo1 region of the hexaploid wheat genome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were then used to generate markers close to Bo1 on the distal end of chromosome 7BL. In the 16 gene fragments totaling 19.6 kb, SNPs were observed between the two cultivars Cranbrook and Halberd at a low frequency (one every 613 bp). Furthermore, SNPs were distributed unevenly, being limited to only two genes. In contrast, RFLP provided a much greater number of genetic markers, with every tested gene identifying polymorphism. Bo1 previously known only as a QTL was located as a discrete Mendelian locus. In total, 28 new RFLP, PCR and SSR markers were added to the existing map. The 1.8 cM Bo1 interval of wheat corresponds to a 227 kb section of rice chromosome 6L encoding 21 predicted proteins with no homology to any known B transporters. The co-dominant PCR marker AWW5L7 co-segregated with Bo1 and was highly predictive of B tolerance status within a set of 94 Australian bread wheat cultivars and breeding lines. The markers and rice colinearity described here represent tools that will assist B tolerance breeding and the positional cloning of Bo1.
17585380	The identification of candidate rice genes that confer resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) through representational difference analysis.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	The development of rice varieties (Oryza sativa L.) that are resistant to the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is an important objective in current breeding programs. In this study, we generated 132 BC(5)F(5) near-isogenic rice lines (NILs) by five backcrosses of Samgangbyeo, a BPH resistant indica variety carrying the Bph1 locus, with Nagdongbyeo, a BPH susceptible japonica variety. To identify genes that confer BPH resistance, we employed representational difference analysis (RDA) to detect transcripts that were exclusively expressed in one of our BPH resistant NIL, SNBC61, during insect feeding. The chromosomal mapping of the RDA clones that we subsequently isolated revealed that they are located in close proximity either to known quantitative trait loci or to an introgressed SSR marker from the BPH resistant donor parent Samgangbyeo. Genomic DNA gel-blot analysis further revealed that loci of all RDA clones in SNBC61 correspond to the alleles of Samgangbyeo. Most of the RDA clones were found to be exclusively expressed in SNBC61 and could be assigned to functional groups involved in plant defense. These RDA clones therefore represent candidate defense genes for BPH resistance.
17593343	Genetic basis of 17 traits and viscosity parameters characterizing the eating and cooking quality of rice grain.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Delong 208 was used to analyze the genetic basis of the cooking and eating quality of rice as reflected by 17 traits (or parameters). These traits include amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC), alkali spreading value (ASV), cooked rice elongation (CRE), and 13 parameters from the viscosity profile. All the traits, except peak paste viscosity (PKV), time needed from gelatinization to peak (BAtime), and CRE, can be divided into two classes according to their interrelationship. The first class consists of AC, GC, and most of the paste viscosity parameters that form a major determinant of eating quality. The second class includes ASV, pasting temperature (Atemp) and pasting time (Atime), which characterize cooking process. We identified 26 QTL (quantitative trait locus or loci) in 2 years; nine QTL clusters emerged. The two major clusters, which correspond to the Wx and Alk loci, control the traits in the first and second classes, respectively. Some QTL are co-located for the traits belonging to the same class and also for the traits to a different class. The Wx locus also affects on ASV while the Alk locus also makes minor contributions to GC and some paste viscosity parameters. The QTL clusters on other chromosomes are similar to the Wx locus or Alk locus, although the variations they explained are relatively minor. QTL for CRE and PKV are dispersed and independent of the Wx locus. Low paste viscosity corresponds to low AC and soft gel, which represents good eating quality for most Chinese consumers; high ASV and low Atemp, together with reduced time to gelatinization and PKV, indicate preferred cooking quality. The genetic basis of Atemp, Atime, BAtime, peak temperature, peak time, paste viscosity at 95 degrees C, and final paste viscosity is newly examined to reveal a complete and dynamic viscosity profile.
17619853	Comparative analyses reveal high levels of conserved colinearity between the finger millet and rice genomes.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Finger millet is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) grass that belongs to the Chloridoideae subfamily. A comparative analysis has been carried out to determine the relationship of the finger millet genome with that of rice. Six of the nine finger millet homoeologous groups corresponded to a single rice chromosome each. Each of the remaining three finger millet groups were orthologous to two rice chromosomes, and in all the three cases one rice chromosome was inserted into the centromeric region of a second rice chromosome to give the finger millet chromosomal configuration. All observed rearrangements were, among the grasses, unique to finger millet and, possibly, the Chloridoideae subfamily. Gene orders between rice and finger millet were highly conserved, with rearrangements being limited largely to single marker transpositions and small putative inversions encompassing at most three markers. Only some 10% of markers mapped to non-syntenic positions in rice and finger millet and the majority of these were located in the distal 14% of chromosome arms, supporting a possible correlation between recombination and sequence evolution as has previously been observed in wheat. A comparison of the organization of finger millet, Panicoideae and Pooideae genomes relative to rice allowed us to infer putative ancestral chromosome configurations in the grasses.
17622509	Investigation of rice transgene flow in compass sectors by using male sterile line as a pollen detector.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Rice is the most important staple food in the world. The rapid development of transgenic rice and its future commercialization have raised concerns regarding transgene flow and its potential environmental risk. It is known that rice is a self-pollinated crop; the outcrossing rate between common cultivars is generally less than 1%. In order to improve the detection sensitivity of rice transgene flow, a male sterile (ms) line BoA with a high outcrossing rate was used as a pollen detector in this study. A concentric circle design was adopted, in which the transgenic rice B2 containing bar gene as a pollen donor was planted in the center circle and the recipient BoA was planted in eight compass sectors. The frequency of transgene flow in compass sectors was analyzed by continuous sampling to generate cumulative data. The results of two years with sound reproducibility demonstrated that the rice gene flow was closely associated with the wind direction. According to the mean frequency of transgene flow, the eight sectors can be divided into two groups: a higher frequency group downstream of the prevailing wind (DPW) with a mean frequency ranging from 6.47 to 26.24%, and a lower frequency group lateral to or upstream of the prevailing wind (UPW) with a mean frequency of 0.39 to 3.03%. On the basis of the cumulative data, 90-96% of the cumulative gene flow events occurred in the four DPW sectors, while it was 4-10% in the four UPW sectors. By using these systematic data, simulation models and isograms of transgene flow in the eight compass sectors were calculated and drawn, respectively.
17657469	Functional analysis of Xa3/Xa26 family members in rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Plant disease resistant (R) genes are frequently clustered in the genome. The diversity of members in a complex R-gene family may provide variation in resistance specificity. Rice Xa3/Xa26, conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein and belongs to a multigene family, consisting of Xa3/Xa26, MRKa, MRKc and MRKd in rice cultivar Minghui 63. MRKa and MRKc are intact genes, while MRKd is a pseudogene. Complementary analyses showed that MRKa and MRKc could not mediate resistance to Xoo when regulated by their native promoters, but MRKa not MRKc conferred partial resistance to Xoo when regulated by a strong constitutive promoter. Plants carrying truncated XA3/XA26, which lacked the kinase domain, were compromised in their resistance to Xoo. However, the kinase domain of MRKa could partially restore the function of the truncated XA3/XA26 in resistance. MRKa and MRKc showed similar expression pattern as Xa3/Xa26, which expressed only in the vascular systems of different tissues. The expressional characteristic of MRKa and MRKc perfectly fits the function of genes conferring resistance to Xoo, a vascular pathogen. These results suggest that although MRKa and MRKc cannot mediate bacterial blight resistance nowadays, they may be once effective genes for Xoo resistance. Their expressional characteristic and sequence similarity to Xa3/Xa26 will provide templates for generating novel recognition specificity to face the evolution of Xoo. In addition, both LRR and kinase domains encoded by Xa3/Xa26 and MRKa are the functional determinants and MRKa-mediated resistance is dosage-dependent.
17657470	A marker-assisted backcross approach for developing submergence-tolerant rice cultivars.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Submergence stress regularly affects 15 million hectares or more of rainfed lowland rice areas in South and Southeast Asia. A major QTL on chromosome 9, Sub1, has provided the opportunity to apply marker assisted backcrossing (MAB) to develop submergence tolerant versions of rice cultivars that are widely grown in the region. In the present study, molecular markers that were tightly linked with Sub1, flanking Sub1, and unlinked to Sub1 were used to apply foreground, recombinant, and background selection, respectively, in backcrosses between a submergence-tolerant donor and the widely grown recurrent parent Swarna. By the BC(2)F(2) generation a submergence tolerant plant was identified that possessed Swarna type simple sequence repeat (SSR) alleles on all fragments analyzed except the tip segment of rice chromosome 9 that possessed the Sub1 locus. A BC(3)F(2) double recombinant plant was identified that was homozygous for all Swarna type alleles except for an approximately 2.3-3.4 Mb region surrounding the Sub1 locus. The results showed that the mega variety Swarna could be efficiently converted to a submergence tolerant variety in three backcross generations, involving a time of two to three years. Polymorphic markers for foreground and recombinant selection were identified for four other mega varieties to develop a wider range of submergence tolerant varieties to meet the needs of farmers in the flood-prone regions. This approach demonstrates the effective use of marker assisted selection for a major QTL in a molecular breeding program.
17657471	A quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance at the booting stage on rice chromosome 8.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cold tolerance at the booting stage of a cold-tolerant rice breeding line, Hokkai-PL9, was analyzed. A total of 487 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed throughout the genome were used to survey for polymorphism between Hokkai-PL9 and a cold-sensitive breeding line, Hokkai287, and 54 markers were polymorphic. Single marker analysis revealed that markers on chromosome 8 are associated with cold tolerance. By interval mapping using an F(2) population between Hokkai-PL9 and Hokkai287, a QTL for cold tolerance was detected on the short arm of chromosome 8. The QTL explains 26.6% of the phenotypic variance, and its additive effect is 11.4%. Substitution mapping suggested that the QTL is located in a 193-kb interval between SSR markers RM5647 and PLA61. We tentatively designated the QTL as qCTB8 (quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance at the booting stage on chromosome 8).
17823787	The number of genes having different alleles between rice cultivars estimated by SNP analysis.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large number of genes will enable estimation of the number of genes having different alleles in a population. In the present study, SNPs between 21 rice cultivars including 17 Japanese cultivars, one upland rice, and three indica cultivars were analyzed by PCR-RF-SSCP. PCR-RF-SSCP analysis was found to be a more efficient method for detecting SNPs than mismatch-cleavage analysis, though both PCR-RF-SSCP and mismatch-cleavage are useful for screening SNPs. The number of DNA fragments showing polymorphism between Japanese cultivars was 134 in the 1,036 genes analyzed. In 137 genes, 638 DNA polymorphisms were identified. Out of 52 genes having polymorphisms in the exons, one had a frame-shift mutation, three had polymorphism causing amino acid insertions or deletions, and 16 genes had missense polymorphisms. The number of genes having frame-shift mutations and missense polymorphisms between the 17 Japanese cultivars was estimated to be 41 and 677 on average, respectively, and those between japonica and indica to be 425 and 6,977, respectively. Chromosomal regions of cultivars selected in rice breeding processes were identified by SNP analysis of genes.
17846741	Comparison of gene expression between upland and lowland rice cultivars under water stress using cDNA microarray.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	To elucidate the differences in the regulation of water stress tolerance between two genotypes of rice, upland-rice (UR, resistant to water stress) and lowland-rice (LR, susceptible to water stress), we constructed subtracted cDNA libraries from polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-treated and non-treated rice seedlings (IRAT109, an upland-rice variety) by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), from which about 2,000 recombinant colonies were picked and amplified. Then, a cDNA microarray containing these expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was used to analyze the gene expression profiles in UR and LR in response to PEG treatment. Microarray data revealed that the majority of genes expressed in UR and LR are almost identical and Student's t test showed that 13% of all the ESTs detected in leaves and 7% of that in roots expressed differentially in transcripts abundance between the two genotypes. After sequencing, it was found that 64 and 79 unique ESTs expressed at higher levels in UR and LR, respectively. Many of the ESTs that showed higher expression in UR upon PEG treatment represented genes for transcription factors, genes playing roles in detoxification or protection against oxidative stress, and genes that help in maintaining cell turgor. In contrast, some ESTs that showed higher expression in LR were genes functioning in the degradation of cellular components. Based on data from this study and previous reports, we suggest that overexpression of some genes that expressed at higher level in UR may improve water stress tolerance in LR and other plant species.
17851647	Identification and characterization of a major QTL responsible for erect panicle trait in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Panicle erectness (PE) is one of the most important traits for high-yielding japonica cultivars. Although several cultivars with PE trait have been developed and released for commercial production in China, there is little information on the inheritance of PE traits in rice. In the present study, 69 widely cultivated japonica cultivars and a double haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between a PE cultivar (Wuyunjing 8) and a drooping panicle cultivar (Nongken 57) were utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of PE formation and to map PE associated genes. Our data suggested that panicle length (PL) and plant height (PH) significantly affected panicle curvature (PC), with shorter PL and PH resulting in smaller PC and consequently more erect. A putative major gene was identified on chromosome 9 by molecular markers and bulk segregant analysis in DH population. In order to finely map the major gene, all simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers on chromosome 9 as well as 100 newly developed sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were used to construct a linkage group for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. A major QTL, qPE9-1, between STS marker H90 and SSR marker RM5652, was detected, and accounted for 41.72% of PC variation with pleiotropic effect on PH and PL. another QTL, qPE9-2, was also found to be adjacent to qPE9-1. In addition, we found that H90, the nearest marker to qPE9-1, used for genotyping 38 cultivars with extremely erect and drooping panicles, segregated in agreement with PC, suggesting the H90 product was possibly part of the qPE9-1 gene or closely related to it. These data demonstrated that H90 could be used for marker-aided selection for the PE trait in breeding and in the cloning of qPE9-1.
17909744	A novel gene, Pi40(t), linked to the DNA markers derived from NBS-LRR motifs confers broad spectrum of blast resistance in rice.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is a continuous threat to stable rice production worldwide. In a modernized agricultural system, the development of varieties with broad-spectrum and durable resistance to blast disease is essential for increased rice production and sustainability. In this study, a new gene is identified in the introgression line IR65482-4-136-2-2 that has inherited the resistance gene from an EE genome wild Oryza species, O. australiensis (Acc. 100882). Genetic and molecular analysis localized a major resistance gene, Pi40(t), on the short arm of chromosome 6, where four blast resistance genes (Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi9) were also identified, flanked by the markers S2539 and RM3330. Through e-Landing, 14 BAC/PAC clones within the 1.81-Mb equivalent virtual contig were identified on Rice Pseudomolecule3. Highly stringent primer sets designed for 6 NBS-LRR motifs located within PAC clone P0649C11 facilitated high-resolution mapping of the new resistance gene, Pi40(t). Following association analysis and detailed haplotyping approaches, a DNA marker, 9871.T7E2b, was identified to be linked to the Pi40(t) gene at the 70 Kb chromosomal region, and differentiated the Pi40(t) gene from the LTH monogenic differential lines possessing genes Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi-9. Pi40(t) was validated using the most virulent isolates of Korea as well as the Philippines, suggesting a broad spectrum for the resistance gene. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pathotyping of BC progenies having two japonica cultivar genetic backgrounds further supported the potential of the resistance gene in rice breeding. Our study based on new gene identification strategies provides insight into novel genetic resources for blast resistance as well as future studies on cloning and functional analysis of a blast resistance gene useful for rice improvement.
17924090	High-resolution genetic mapping of bacterial blight resistance gene Xa10.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is the most devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa L). Rice lines that carry resistance (R) gene Xa10 confer race-specific resistance to Xoo strains harboring avirulence (Avr) gene avrXa10. Here we report on genetic study, disease evaluation and fine genetic mapping of the Xa10 gene. The inheritance of Xa10-mediated resistance to PXO99A(pHM1avrXa10) did not follow typical Mendelian inheritance for single dominant gene in F2 population derived from IR24 x IRBB10. A locus might be present in IRBB10 that caused distorted segregation in F2 population. To eliminate this locus, an F3 population (F3-65) was identified, which showed normal Mendelian segregation ratio of 3:1 for resistance and susceptibility. A new near-isogenic line (F3-65-1743) of Xa10 in IR24 genetic background was developed and designated as IRBB10A. IRBB10A retained similar resistance specificity as that of IRBB10 and provided complete resistance to PXO99A(pHM1avrXa10) from seedling to adult stages. Linkage analysis using existing RFLP markers and F2 mapping population mapped the Xa10 locus to the proximal side of E1981S with genetic distance at 0.93 cM. With five new RFLP markers developed from the genomic sequence of Nipponbare, Xa10 was finely mapped at genetic distance of 0.28 cM between proximal marker M491 and distal marker M419 and co-segregated with markers S723 and M604. The physical distance between M491 and M419 on Nipponbare genome is 74 kb. Seven genes have been annotated from this 74-kb region and six of them are possible Xa10 candidates. The results of this study will be useful in Xa10 cloning and marker-assisted breeding.
17952400	Identification of a candidate gene for the wheat endopeptidase Ep-D1 locus and two other STS markers linked to the eyespot resistance gene Pch1.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Wheat is prone to strawbreaker foot rot (eyespot), a fungal disease caused by Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis. The most effective source of genetic resistance is Pch1, a gene derived from Aegilops ventricosa. The endopeptidase isozyme marker allele Ep-D1b, linked to Pch1, has been shown to be more effective for tracking resistance than DNA-based markers developed to date. Therefore, we sought to identify a candidate gene for Ep-D1 as a basis for a DNA-based marker. Comparative mapping suggested that the endopeptidase loci Ep-D1 (wheat), enp1 (maize), and Enp (rice) were orthologous. Since the product of the maize endopeptidase locus enp1 has been shown to exhibit biochemical properties similar to oligopeptidase B purified from E. coli, we reasoned that Ep-D1 may also encode an oligopeptidase B. Consistent with this hypothesis, a sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker, Xorw1, derived from an oligopeptidase B-encoding wheat expressed-sequence-tag (EST) showed complete linkage with Ep-D1 and Pch1 in a population of 254 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wheat cultivars Coda and Brundage. Two other STS markers, Xorw5 and Xorw6, and three microsatellite markers (Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175) were also completely linked to Pch1. On the other hand, Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 showed recombination in the W7984 x Opata85 RIL population suggesting that recombination near Pch1 is reduced in the Coda/Brundage population. In a panel of 44 wheat varieties with known eyespot reactions, Xorw1, Xorw5, and Xorw6 were 100% accurate in predicting the presence or absence of Pch1 whereas Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 were less effective. Thus, linkage mapping and a germplasm survey suggest that the STS markers identified here should be useful for indirect selection of Pch1.
17989953	The QTL analysis on maternal and endosperm genome and their environmental interactions for characters of cooking quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Investigations to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing cooking quality traits including amylose content, gel consistency and gelatinization temperature (expressed by the alkali spread value) were conducted using a set of 241 RIL populations derived from an elite hybrid cross of "Zhenshan 97"x"Minghui 63" and their reciprocal backcrosses BC1F1 and BC2F1 populations in two environments. QTLs and QTLxenvironment interactions were analyzed by using the genetic model with endosperm and maternal effects and environmental interaction effects on quantitative traits of seed in cereal crops. The results suggested that a total of seven QTLs were associated with cooking quality of rice, which were subsequently mapped to chromosomes 1, 4 and 6. Six of these QTLs were also found to have environmental interaction effects.
18060657	Distribution and mapping of an active autonomous aDart element responsible for mobilizing nonautonomous nDart1 transposons in cultivated rice varieties.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	An endogenous 0.6-kb rice DNA transposon, nDart1, has been identified as a causative element of a spontaneous mutable virescent allele pyl-v conferring pale-yellow leaves with dark-green sectors in the seedlings, due to somatic excision of nDart1 integrated into the OsClpP5 gene encoding the nuclear-coded chloroplast protease. As the transposition of nDart1 depends on the presence of an active autonomous aDart element in the genome, the plants exhibiting the leaf variegation carry the active aDart element. As several mutable alleles caused by nDart1 insertions have subsequently been identified, nDart1-promoted gene tagging has been proven to be an effective system. At present, the nDart/aDart system appears to be the only endogenous rice DNA transposon system whose transposition activity can be controlled under natural growth conditions without any artificial treatments, including tissue cultures. To apply the nDart/aDart tagging system in various cultivated rice varieties, we explored the presence and distribution of an active autonomous aDart element in 19 temperate japonica, 30 tropical japonica, and 51 indica varieties. Only eight temperate japonica varieties were found to bear a single copy of an active aDart element, and no aDart activity could be detected in the indica varieties examined. Six of seven japonica varieties appear to carry the active aDart element at the identical site on chromosome 6, whereas the remaining one contains aDart on chromosome 5. Leaf variegations in the plants with the mutable pyl-v allele and the excision frequencies of endogenous nDart1 elements indicated that the aDart element on chromosome 6 is more active than that on chromosome 5. The findings described here are an important step in the development of a new and efficient nDart1-promoted gene-tagging system in various rice cultivars.
18074114	Fine scale genetic and physical mapping using interstitial deletion mutants of Lr34 /Yr18: a disease resistance locus effective against multiple pathogens in wheat.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The Lr34/Yr18 locus has contributed to durable, non-race specific resistance against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregates with resistance to powdery mildew (Pm38) and a leaf tip necrosis phenotype (Ltn1). Using a high resolution mapping family from a cross between near-isogenic lines in the "Thatcher" background we demonstrated that Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregated with stem rust resistance in the field. Lr34/Yr18 probably interacts with unlinked genes to provide enhanced stem rust resistance in "Thatcher". In view of the relatively low levels of DNA polymorphism reported in the Lr34/Yr18 region, gamma irradiation of the single chromosome substitution line, Lalbahadur(Parula7D) that carries Lr34/Yr18 was used to generate several mutant lines. Characterisation of the mutants revealed a range of highly informative genotypes, which included variable size deletions and an overlapping set of interstitial deletions. The mutants enabled a large number of wheat EST derived markers to be mapped and define a relatively small physical region on chromosome 7DS that carried Lr34/Yr18. Fine scale genetic mapping confirmed the physical mapping and identified a genetic interval of less than 0.5 cM, which contained Lr34/Yr18. Both rice and Brachypodium genome sequences provided useful information for fine mapping of ESTs in wheat. Gene order was more conserved between wheat and Brachypodium than with rice but these smaller grass genomes did not reveal sequence information that could be used to identify a candidate gene for rust resistance in wheat. We predict that Lr34/Yr18 is located within a large insertion in wheat not found at syntenic positions in Brachypodium and rice.
18075727	Identification of defense-related genes in rice responding to challenge by Rhizoctonia solani.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani is one of the major diseases of rice. The pathogen infects rice plants directly through stomata or using lobate appressoria and hyphal masses called infection cushions. The infection structures were normally found at 36 h post-inoculation. During infection, the pathogenesis-related genes, PR1b and PBZ1 were induced in rice plants. To identify rice genes induced early in the defense response, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to generate a cDNA library enriched for transcripts differentially expressed during infection by R. solani. After differential screening by membrane-based hybridization and subsequent confirmation by reverse Northern blot analysis, selected clones were sequenced. Fifty unique cDNA clones were found and assigned to five different functional categories. Most of the genes were not previously identified as being induced in response to pathogens. We examined expression of 100 rice genes induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryze (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xooc). Twenty-five of them were found to be differentially expressed after the sheath blight infection, suggesting overlap of defense responses to different fungal and bacterial pathogens infection.
18092146	Fine mapping of a yield-enhancing QTL cluster associated with transgressive variation in an Oryza sativa x O. rufipogon cross.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	A high-resolution physical map targeting a cluster of yield-related QTLs on the long arm of rice chromosome 9 has been constructed across a 37.4 kb region containing seven predicted genes. Using a series of BC3F4 nearly isogenic lines (NILs) derived from a cross between the Korean japonica cultivar Hwaseongbyeo and Oryza rufipogon (IRGC 105491), a total of seven QTLs for 1,000-grain weight, spikelets per panicle, grains per panicle, panicle length, spikelet density, heading date and plant height were identified in the cluster (P<or=0.0001). All seven QTLs were additive, and alleles from the low-yielding O. rufipogon parent were beneficial in the Hwaseongbyeo background. Yield trials with BC3F4 NILs showed that lines containing a homozygous O. rufipogon introgression in the target region out-yielded sibling NILs containing Hwaseongbyeo DNA by 14.2-17.7%, and out-yielded the Hwaseongbyeo parent by 16.2-23.7%. While higher yielding plants containing the O. rufipogon introgression were also taller and later than controls, the fact that all seven of the QTLs were co-localized in the same 37.4 kb interval suggests the possibility that a single, pleiotropic gene acting as a major regulator of plant development may control this suite of agronomically important plant phenotypes.
18092148	Pm37, a new broadly effective powdery mildew resistance gene from Triticum timopheevii.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Powdery mildew is an important foliar disease in wheat, especially in areas with a cool or maritime climate. A dominant powdery mildew resistance gene transferred to the hexaploid germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 from T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was mapped distally on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Differential reactions were observed between the resistance gene in NC99BGTAG11 and the alleles of the Pm1 locus that is also located on chromosome arm 7AL. Observed segregation in F2:3 lines from the cross NC99BGTAG11xAxminster (Pm1a) demonstrate that germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 carries a novel powdery mildew resistance gene, which is now designated as Pm37. This new gene is highly effective against all powdery mildew isolates tested so far. Analyses of the population with molecular markers indicate that Pm37 is located 16 cM proximal to the Pm1 complex. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xgwm332 and Xwmc790 were located 0.5 cM proximal and distal, respectively, to Pm37. In order to identify new markers in the region, wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in the distal 10% of 7AL that were orthologous to sequences from chromosome 6 of rice were targeted. The two new EST-derived STS markers were located distal to Pm37 and one marker was closely linked to the Pm1a region. These new markers can be used in marker-assisted selection schemes to develop wheat cultivars with pyramids of powdery mildew resistance genes, including combinations of Pm37 in coupling linkage with alleles of the Pm1 locus.
18097643	Indian rice "Kasalath" contains genes that improve traits of Japanese premium rice "Koshihikari".	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), in which chromosomal segments of the Indian landrace "Kasalath" replace the corresponding endogenous segments in the genome of the Japanese premium rice "Koshihikari", are available and together cover the entire genome. Chromosome regions affecting a trait (CRATs) can be identified by comparison of phenotypes with genotypes of CSSLs. We detected 99 CRATs for 15 agronomic or morphological traits. "Kasalath" had positively acting alleles in 53 CRATs. Its CRATs increased panicle number per plant by up to 23.3%, grain number per panicle by up to 30.8%, and total grain number by up to 15.1%, relative to "Koshihikari". CRATs were identified for grain size (grain thickness and width), with positive effects of about 5.0%. A CRAT on chromosome 8 almost doubled the weight of roots in uppermost soil layers compared to "Koshihikari". Additionally, "Kasalath" possessed CRATs for higher lodging resistance (reduction in plant height and increase in stem diameter). In some cases, multiple CRATs were detected in the same chromosome regions. Therefore, CSSLs with these chromosome segments might be useful breeding materials for the simultaneous improvement of multiple traits. Five CRATs, one for plant height on chromosome 1, one for stem diameter on chromosome 8, and three for heading date on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 overlapped with the corresponding QTLs that already had been mapped with back-crossed inbred lines of "Nipponbare" and "Kasalath". In both "Koshihikari" CRATs and "Nipponbare" QTLs, "Kasalath" had similar effects.
18214422	Chromosomal polymorphism of ribosomal genes in the genus Oryza.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The genes encoding for 18S-5.8S-28S ribosomal RNA (rDNA) are both conserved and diversified. We used rDNA as probe in the fluorescent in situ hybridization (rDNA-FISH) to localized rDNAs on chromosomes of 15 accessions representing ten Oryza species. These included cultivated and wild species of rice, and four of them are tetraploids. Our results reveal polymorphism in the number of rDNA loci, in the number of rDNA repeats, and in their chromosomal positions among Oryza species. The numbers of rDNA loci varies from one to eight among Oryza species. The rDNA locus located at the end of the short arm of chromosome 9 is conserved among the genus Oryza. The rDNA locus at the end of the short arm of chromosome 10 was lost in some of the accessions. In this study, we report two genome specific rDNA loci in the genus Oryza. One is specific to the BB genome, which was localized at the end of the short arm of chromosome 4. Another may be specific to the CC genome, which was localized in the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 5. A particular rDNA locus was detected as stretched chromatin with bright signals at the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 4 in O. grandiglumis by rDNA-FISH. We suggest that chromosomal inversion and the amplification and transposition of rDNA might occur during Oryza species evolution. The possible mechanisms of cyto-evolution in tetraploid Oryza species are discussed.
18219477	Fine mapping of a major quantitative trait loci, qSSP7, controlling the number of spikelets per panicle as a single Mendelian factor in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	In our previous studies, one putative QTL affecting number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) was identified in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 7 using a recombinant inbred population. In order to define the QTL (qSPP7), RI50, a recombinant inbred line with 70% of genetic background same as the female parent of Zhenshan 97, was selected to produce near-isogenic lines for the target region in the present study. In a BC(2)F(2) population consisting of 190 plants, the frequency distribution of SPP was shown to be discontinuous and followed the expected Mendelian ratios (1:2:1 by progeny test) for single locus segregation. qSPP7 was mapped to a 0.4 cM region between SSR marker RM3859 and RFLP marker C39 based on tests of the BC(2)F(2) population and its progeny. Its additive and dominant effects on SPP were 51.1 and 24.9 spikelets, respectively. Of great interest, the QTL region also had effects on grain yield per plant (YD), 1,000 grain weight (GW), tillers per plant (TPP) and seed setting ratio (SR). Significant correlations were observed between SPP and YD (r = 0.66) and between SPP and SR (r = -0.29) in the progeny test. 1082 extremely small panicle plants of a BC(3)F(2) population containing 8,400 individuals were further used to fine map the QTL. It turns out that qSPP7 co-segregated with two markers, RM5436 and RM5499 spanning a physical distance of 912.4 kb. Overall results suggested that recombination suppression occurred in the region and positional cloning strategy is infeasible for qSPP7 isolation. The higher grain yield of Minghui 63 homozygote as compared to the heterozygote suggested that Minghui 63 homozygote at qSPP7 in hybrid rice could further improve its yield.
18236025	Comparison of the observed with the simulated distributions of the parental genome contribution in two marker-assisted backcross programs in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Computer simulations are useful tools to optimize marker-assisted breeding programs. The objective of our study was to investigate the closeness of computer simulations of the recurrent parent genome recovery with experimental data obtained in two marker-assisted backcrossing programs in rice (Orzya sativa L.). We simulated the breeding programs as they were practically carried out. In the simulations we estimated the frequency distributions of the recurrent parent genome proportion in the backcross populations. The simulated distributions were in good agreement with those obtained practically. The simulation results were also observed to be robust with respect to the choice of the mapping function and the accuracy of the linkage map. We conclude that computer simulations are a useful tool for pre-experiment estimation of selection response in marker-assisted backcrossing.
18274726	Genetic dissection and pyramiding of quantitative traits for panicle architecture by using chromosomal segment substitution lines in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	To understand the genetic basis of yield-related traits of rice, we developed 39 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) from a cross between an average-yielding japonica cultivar, Sasanishiki, as the recurrent parent and a high-yielding indica cultivar, Habataki, as the donor. Five morphological components of panicle architecture in the CSSLs were evaluated in 2 years, and 38 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed on 11 chromosomes were detected. The additive effect of each QTL was relatively small, suggesting that none of the QTLs could explain much of the phenotypic difference in sink size between Sasanishiki and Habataki. We developed nearly isogenic lines for two major QTLs, qSBN1 (for secondary branch number on chromosome 1) and qPBN6 (for primary branch number on chromosome 6), and a line containing both. Phenotypic analysis of these lines revealed that qSBN1 and qPBN6 contributed independently to sink size and that the combined line produced more spikelets. This suggests that the cumulative effects of QTLs distributed throughout the genome form the major genetic basis of panicle architecture in rice.
17143630	A paracentric inversion suppresses genetic recombination at the FON3 locus with breakpoints corresponding to sequence gaps on rice chromosome 11L.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Paracentric inversion is known to inhibit genetic recombination between normal and inverted chromosomal segments in heterozygous arrangements. Insect inversion polymorphisms have been studied to reveal adaptive processes for maintaining genetic variation. We report the first paracentric inversion in rice (Oryza sativa), which was discovered in our effort to clone the floral organ number gene FON3. Recombination at the FON3 locus on the long arm of chromosome 11 was severely suppressed over a distance of more than 36 cM. An extensive screening among 8,242 F(2) progeny failed to detect any recombinants. Cytological analysis revealed a loop-like structure on pachytene chromosomes, whereas FISH analysis showed the migration of a BAC clone from a distal location to a position closer to the centromere. Interestingly, the locations where the genetic recombination suppression began were coincided with the positions of two physical gaps on the chromosome 11, suggesting a correlation between the physical gaps, the inversion breakpoints. Transposons and retrotransposons, and tandemly arranged members of gene families were among the sequences immediately flanking the gaps. Taken together, we propose that the genetic suppression at the FON3 locus was caused by a paracentric inversion. The possible genetic mechanism causing such a spontaneous inversion was proposed.
17180359	The family of DOF transcription factors: from green unicellular algae to vascular plants.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	This article deals with the origin and evolution of the DOF transcription factor family through a phylogenetic analysis of those DOF sequences identified from a variety of representative organisms from different taxonomic groups: the green unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the fern Selaginella moellendorffii, the gymnosperm Pinus taeda, the dicotyledoneous Arabidopsis thaliana and the monocotyledoneous angiosperms Oryza sativa and Hordeum vulgare. In barley, we have identified 26 different DOF genes by sequence analyses of clones isolated from the screening of genomic libraries and of ESTs, whereas a single DOF gene was identified by bioinformatics searches in the Chlamydomonas genome. The phylogenetic analysis groups all these genes into six major clusters of orthologs originated from a primary basal grade. Our results suggest that duplications of an ancestral DOF, probably formed in the photosynthetic eukaryotic ancestor, followed by subsequent neo-, sub-functionalization and pseudogenization processes would have triggered the expansion of the DOF family. Loss, acquisition and shuffling of conserved motifs among the new DOFs likely underlie the mechanism of formation of the distinct subfamilies.
17237941	Biased distribution of microsatellite motifs in the rice genome.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Microsatellites are useful tools to study the extent of divergence between two taxonomic groups that show high sequence similarity. We have compared microsatellite distribution to illustrate genetic variation between the two rice genomes, Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica. Microsatellite distribution proved to be non random as certain regions of very high microsatellite density have been identified. Microsatellite density in the subspecies japonica was computed marginally higher than in the subspecies indica in the genomic regions compared between the two subspecies. Unexpectedly high microsatellite densities were observed in 5'-untranslated regions of genes. These regions also displayed a clear motif bias. Some of the longest microsatellite repeats were found in intron sequences. Frequency, as well as motif bias was also noted with respect to the association of microsatellites with transposable elements. Microsatellite mutability values were exemplarily estimated for 90 loci by aligning the microsatellite containing regions between the two genomes. Poor rates of finding an orthologue corresponded with high microsatellite mutability in rice. These insights are likely to play a significant role in selecting microsatellite loci to be used in molecular breeding and studying evolutionary dynamics of the two subspecies.
17593393	Dating the early evolution of plants: detection and molecular clock analyses of orthologs.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Orthologs generally are under selective pressure against loss of function, while paralogs usually accumulate mutations and finally die or deviate in terms of function or regulation. Most ortholog detection methods contaminate the resulting datasets with a substantial amount of paralogs. Therefore we aimed to implement a straightforward method that allows the detection of ortholog clusters with a reduced amount of paralogs from completely sequenced genomes. The described cross-species expansion of the reciprocal best BLAST hit method is a time-effective method for ortholog detection, which results in 68% truly orthologous clusters and the procedure specifically enriches single-copy orthologs. The detection of true orthologs can provide a phylogenetic toolkit to better understand evolutionary processes. In a study across six photosynthetic eukaryotes, nuclear genes of putative mitochondrial origin were shown to be over-represented among single copy orthologs. These orthologs are involved in fundamental biological processes like amino acid metabolism or translation. Molecular clock analyses based on this dataset yielded divergence time estimates for the red/green algae (1,142 MYA), green algae/land plant (725 MYA), mosses/seed plant (496 MYA), gymno-/angiosperm (385 MYA) and monocotyledons/core eudicotyledons (301 MYA) divergence times.
17576597	Identification and fine mapping of Pi39(t), a major gene conferring the broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The Chinese native cultivar (cv.) Q15 expresses the broad-spectrum resistance to most of the isolates collected from China. To effectively utilize the resistance, three rounds of linkage analysis were performed in an F(2) population derived from a cross of Q15 and a susceptible cv. Tsuyuake, which segregated into 3:1 (resistant/susceptible) ratio. The first round of linkage analysis employing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was carried out in the F(2) population through bulked-segregant assay. A total of 180 SSR markers selected from each chromosome equally were surveyed. The results revealed that only two polymorphic markers, RM247 and RM463, located on chromosome 12, were linked to the resistance (R) gene. To further define the chromosomal location of the R gene locus, the second round of linkage analysis was performed using additional five SSR markers, which located in the region anchored by markers RM247 and RM463. The locus was further mapped to a 0.27 cM region bounded by markers RM27933 and RM27940 in the pericentromeric region towards the short arm. For fine mapping of the R locus, seven new markers were developed in the smaller region for the third round of linkage analysis, based on the reference sequences. The R locus was further mapped to a 0.18 cM region flanked by marker clusters 39M11 and 39M22, which is closest to, but away from the Pita/Pita(2) locus by 0.09 cM. To physically map the locus, all the linked markers were landed on the respective bacterial artificial chromosome clones of the reference cv. Nipponbare. Sequence information of these clones was used to construct a physical map of the locus, in silico, by bioinformatics analysis. The locus was physically defined to an interval of approximately 37 kb. To further characterize the R gene, five R genes mapped near the locus, as well as 10 main R genes those might be exploited in the resistance breeding programs, were selected for differential tests with 475 Chinese isolates. The R gene carrier Q15 conveys resistances distinct from those conditioned by the carriers of the 15 R genes. Together, this valuable R gene was, therefore, designated as Pi39(t). The sequence information of the R gene locus could be used for further marker-based selection and cloning.
17579886	RL-SAGE and microarray analysis of the rice transcriptome after Rhizoctonia solani infection.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Sheath blight caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani is an emerging problem in rice production worldwide. To elucidate the molecular basis of rice defense to the pathogen, RNA isolated from R. solani-infected leaves of Jasmine 85 was used for both RL-SAGE library construction and microarray hybridization. RL-SAGE sequence analysis identified 20,233 and 24,049 distinct tags from the control and inoculated libraries, respectively. Nearly half of the significant tags (> or =2 copies) from both libraries matched TIGR annotated genes and KOME full-length cDNAs. Among them, 42% represented sense and 7% antisense transcripts, respectively. Interestingly, 60% of the library-specific (> or =10 copies) and differentially expressed (>4.0-fold change) tags were novel transcripts matching genomic sequence but not annotated genes. About 70% of the genes identified in the SAGE libraries showed similar expression patterns (up or down-regulated) in the microarray data obtained from three biological replications. Some candidate RL-SAGE tags and microarray genes were located in known sheath blight QTL regions. The expression of ten differentially expressed RL-SAGE tags was confirmed with RT-PCR. The defense genes associated with resistance to R. solani identified in this study are useful genomic materials for further elucidation of the molecular basis of the defense response to R. solani and fine mapping of target sheath blight QTLs.
17636330	Expression analysis of calcium-dependent protein kinase gene family during reproductive development and abiotic stress conditions in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are important sensors of Ca(+2) flux in plants, which control plant development and responses by regulating downstream components of calcium signaling pathways. Availability of the whole genome sequence and microarray platform allows investigation of genome-wide organization and expression profile of CDPK genes in rice with a view to ultimately define their function in plant systems. Genome-wide analysis led to identification of 31 CDPK genes in rice after a thorough annotation exercise based upon HMM profiles. Twenty-nine already identified CDPK genes were verified and two new members were added to the CDPK gene family of rice. Relative expression of all these genes has been analyzed by using Affymetrix rice genome arraytrade mark during three vegetative stages, six stages of panicle (P1-P6) and five stages of seed (S1-S5) development along with three abiotic stress conditions, viz. cold, salt and desiccation, given to seedling. Thirty-one CDPK genes were found to express in at least one of the experimental stages studied. Of these, transcripts for twenty three genes accumulated differentially during reproductive developmental stages; nine of them were preferentially up-regulated only in panicle, five were up-regulated in stages of panicles as well as seed development, whereas, expression of one gene was found to be specific to the S1 stage of seed development. Eight genes were found to be down-regulated during the panicle and seed developmental stages. Six CDPK genes were found to be induced while the expression of one gene was down-regulated under stress conditions. The differential expression of CDPK genes during reproductive development and stress is suggestive of their involvement in the underlying signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, up-regulation of common genes both during reproductive development as well as stress responses is indicative of common element between reproduction and stress.
17680272	Genomewide computational analysis of nitrate response elements in rice and Arabidopsis.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Nitrate response element (NRE) was originally reported to be comprised of an Ag/cTCA core sequence motif preceded by a 7-bp AT rich region, based on promoter deletion analyses in nitrate and nitrite reductases from Arabidopsis thaliana and birch. In view of hundreds of new nitrate responsive genes discovered recently, we sought to computationally verify whether the above motif indeed qualifies to be the cis-acting NRE for all the responsive genes. We searched for the specific occurrence of at least two copies of the above motif in and around the nitrate responsive genes and elsewhere in the Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) genomes, with respect to their positional, orientational and strand-specific bias. This is the first comprehensive analysis of NREs for 625 nitrate responsive genes of Arabidopsis and their rice homologs, representing dicots and monocots, respectively. We report that the above motifs are present almost randomly throughout these genomes and do not reveal any specificity or bias towards nitrate responsive genes. This also seems to be true for smaller subsets of nitrate responsive genes in Arabidopsis, such as the 21 early responsive genes, 261 and 90 genes for root-specific and shoot-specific response, respectively, and 25 housekeeping genes. This necessitates a fresh search for candidate sequences that qualify to be NREs in these and other plants.
17665216	Identification of functional candidate genes for drought tolerance in rice.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Drought tolerance (DT) in rice is known to be controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and involved differential expression of large numbers of genes, but linking QTLs with their underlying genes remains the most challenging issue in plant molecular biology. To shed some light on this issue, differential gene expression in response to PEG simulated drought in 3 unique genetic materials (a lowland rice, IR64 and its derived line, PD86 which has 11 introgressed DT QTLs, and a upland rice IRAT109) was investigated using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization strategy. More than 300 unique subtracted cDNA sequences, covering genes of diverse cellular activities and functions, were identified and confirmed by semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR. Detailed bioinformatics analyses of the data revealed two interesting results. First, the levels and mechanisms of DT of the three rice lines were associated with the number and types of differentially expressed genes, suggesting different DT mechanisms in rice are controlled by different sets of genes and different metabolic pathways, and most differentially expressed genes under drought were able to contribute to DT. Second, there appeared a high correspondence in genomic location between DT QTLs and clusters of differentially expressed genes in rice, suggesting some DT QTLs may represent clusters of co-regulated and functionally related genes. Thus, differential gene expression analyses using genetically characterized materials can provide additional insights into the molecular basis of QTLs and convergent evidence to shortlist the candidate genes for target QTLs.
17805575	Characterization of two rice peroxidase promoters that respond to blast fungus-infection.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Peroxidase (POX) genes consist of a large gene family possibly contributing to self-defense, however constitutive and stress-induced expression patterns of individual gene were poorly understood in rice. We studied here the characteristic expression of two representative rice POX genes, R2329 and R2184, which are blast fungus-inducible (Sasaki et al. in Plant Cell Physiol 45:1442-1452, 2004). Basal GUS activity in R2329 promoter::GUS rice plants was 100-fold higher than that in R2184 promoter::GUS plants, and these levels reflected the transcript levels monitored by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. R2329 promoter was activated by blast fungus-infection and wounding, and R2184 promoter was activated by the fungal-infection and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treatment. By histochemical GUS staining analysis, constitutive R2329 and R2184 expression was commonly found in vascular bundle and exodermis in leaves and roots, while the precise expression profile was characteristic. In blast fungus inoculated R2329 promoter::GUS leaves, GUS staining was induced just around fungus-induced local lesions. Analysis of the 5' deleted promoters suggests the presence of many kinds of stress-responsive elements in the regions between -1798 and -748 of R2329 promoter and between -1975 and -548 of R2184 promoter. These results revealed the stress-responsive characteristics of R2329 and R2184 promoters, and indicated the possible use for generation of useful transgenic plants.
18000683	Centromeric retrotransposon lineages predate the maize/rice divergence and differ in abundance and activity.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Centromeric retrotransposons (CR) are located almost exclusively at the centromeres of plant chromosomes. Analysis of the emerging Zea mays inbred B73 genome sequence revealed two novel subfamilies of CR elements of maize (CRM), bringing the total number of known CRM subfamilies to four. Orthologous subfamilies of each of these CRM subfamilies were discovered in the rice lineage, and the orthologous relationships were demonstrated with extensive phylogenetic analyses. The much higher number of CRs in maize versus Oryza sativa is due primarily to the recent expansion of the CRM1 subfamily in maize. At least one incomplete copy of a CRM1 homolog was found in O. sativa ssp. indica and O. officinalis, but no member of this subfamily could be detected in the finished O. sativa ssp. japonica genome, implying loss of this prolific subfamily in that subspecies. CRM2 and CRM3, as well as the corresponding rice subfamilies, have been recently active but are present in low numbers. CRM3 is a full-length element related to the non-autonomous CentA, which is the first described CRM. The oldest subfamily (CRM4), as well as its rice counterpart, appears to contain only inactive members that are not located in currently active centromeres. The abundance of active CR elements is correlated with chromosome size in the three plant genomes for which high quality genomic sequence is available, and the emerging picture of CR elements is one in which different subfamilies are active at different evolutionary times. We propose a model by which CR elements might influence chromosome and genome size.
17952471	MNU-induced mutant pools and high performance TILLING enable finding of any gene mutation in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Mutant populations are indispensable genetic resources for functional genomics in all organisms. However, suitable rice mutant populations, induced either by chemicals or irradiation still have been rarely developed to date. To produce mutant pools and to launch a search system for rice gene mutations, we developed mutant populations of Oryza sativa japonica cv. Taichung 65, by treating single zygotic cells with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Mutagenesis in single zygotes can create mutations at a high frequency and rarely forms chimeric plants. A modified TILLING system using non-labeled primers and fast capillary gel electrophoresis was applied for high-throughput detection of single nucleotide substitution mutations. The mutation rate of an M(2) mutant population was calculated as 7.4 x 10(-6) per nucleotide representing one mutation in every 135 kb genome sequence. One can expect 7.4 single nucleotide substitution mutations in every 1 kb of gene region when using 1,000 M(2) mutant lines. The mutations were very evenly distributed over the regions examined. These results indicate that our rice mutant population generated by MNU-mutagenesis could be a promising resource for identifying mutations in any gene of rice. The modified TILLING method also proved very efficient and convenient in screening the mutant population.
16289622	Water soluble feruloyl arabinoxylans from rice and ragi: changes upon malting and their consequence on antioxidant activity.	2006	Phytochemistry	The objective of this study is to determine the changes brought about by germination on water soluble feruloyl arabinoxylans (feraxans), one of the major components of soluble fibre from rice and ragi and their consequence on antioxidant activity. Soluble feraxans, isolated from native and malted rice and ragi were fractionated on DEAE-cellulose. Ferulic acid content of the major [0.1 molar ammonium carbonate (AC) eluted] fraction was higher in malts (rice: 1045 microg/g; ragi: 1404 microg/g) than in native (rice: 119 microg/g; ragi: 147 microg/g) and this fraction was separated by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography into two peaks each in rice (native: 232 and 24.4 kDa; malt: 75.4 and 39.6 kDa) and ragi (native: 140 and 15.4 kDa; malt: 38.9 and 15.4 kDa). 0.1 molar AC eluted fractions showed very strong antioxidant activity in vitro as determined by beta-carotene-linoleate emulsion (IC50: 0.16-0.24 mg), DPPH* (IC50: 4.1-11.4 mg) and Ferric reducing/antioxidant power, FRAP (EC1: 0.76-3.1mg) assays. Antioxidant activity of feraxans was several (4.9-1400) folds higher than the expected activity due to their bound ferulic acid content. Apart from ferulic acid, presence of sugars with >C=O (uronyl/acetyl) groups and degree/nature of glycan-polymerization were observed to influence antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides. Malting resulted in many dynamic changes in the ferulic acid content in different feraxan types and affected their antioxidant activity.
16516937	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant alpha1,3/4-fucosidase based on sequence tags from almond fucosidase I.	2006	Phytochemistry	Our work with almond peptide N-glycosidase A made us interested also in the alpha1,3/4-fucosidase which is used as a specific reagent for glycoconjugate analysis. The enzyme was purified to presumed homogeneity by a series of chromatographic steps including dye affinity and fast-performance anion exchange chromatography. The 63 kDa band was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry which yielded several partial sequences. A homology search retrieved the hypothetical protein Q8GW72 from Arabidopsis thaliana. This protein has recently been described as being specific for alpha1,2-linkages. However, cDNA cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of the A. thaliana fucosidase showed that it hydrolyzed fucose in 3- and 4-linkage to GlcNAc in Lewis determinants whereas neither 2-linked fucose nor fucose in 3-linkage to the innermost GlcNAc residue were attacked. This first cloning of a plant alpha1,3/4-fucosidase also confirmed the identity of the purified almond enzyme and thus settles the notorious uncertainty about its molecular mass. The alpha1,3/4-fucosidase from Arabidopsis exhibited striking sequence similarity with an enzyme of similar substrate specificity from Streptomyces sp. (Q9Z4I9) and with putative proteins from rice.
16777157	Differential distribution of tocopherols and tocotrienols in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues.	2006	Phytochemistry	Tocopherols and tocotrienols are vitamin E compounds, differing only in the saturation state of the isoprenoid side chain. Tocopherol biosynthesis, physiology and distribution have been studied in detail. Tocopherols have been found in many different plant species, and plant tissues. In contrast, comparatively little is known about the physiology and distribution of tocotrienols. These compounds appear to be considerably less widespread in the plant kingdom. In this study 80 different plant species were analysed for the presence of tocotrienols. Twenty-four species were found to contain significant amounts of tocotrienols. No taxonomic relation was apparent among the 16 dicotyledonous species that were found to contain tocotrienol. Monocotyledonous species (eight species) belonged either to the Poaceae (six species) or the Aracaceae (two species). A more detailed analysis of tocotrienol accumulation revealed the presence of tocotrienols in several non-photosynthetic tissues and organs, i.e. seeds, fruits and in latex, in concentrations up to 2000 ppm. No tocotrienols could be detected in mature photosynthetic tissues. However, we found the transient accumulation of low levels of tocotrienols in the young coleoptiles of plant species whose seeds contained tocotrienols. No measurable tocotrienol biosynthesis was apparent in coleoptiles, or in chloroplasts isolated from such coleoptiles. In line with these results, we found that tocotrienol accumulation in coleoptiles was not associated with chloroplasts. Based on our data, we conclude that tocotrienols may be transiently present in photosynthetically active tissues, however, it remains to be proven whether the tocotrienols are biosynthesised in such tissues, or imported from elsewhere in the plant.
17466346	Functional genomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana glycoside hydrolase family 35.	2007	Phytochemistry	Catalysing the hydrolysis of terminal beta-galactosyl residues from carbohydrates, galactolipids, and glycoproteins, glycoside hydrolase family 35 (beta-galactosidases; BGALs) are widely distributed in plants and believed to play many key roles, including modification of cell wall components. Completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequencing project has, for the first time, allowed an examination of the total number, gene structure, and evolutionary patterns of all Family 35 members in a representative (model) angiosperm. Reiterative database searches established a multigene family of 17 members (designated BGAL1-BGAL17). Using these genes as query sequences, BLAST and Hidden Markov Model searches identified BGAL genes among 22 other eukaryotes, whose genomic sequences are known. The Arabidopsis (n=17) and rice (n=15) BGAL families were much larger than those of Chlamydomonas, fungi, and animals (n=0-4), and a lineage-specific expansion of BGAL genes apparently occurred after divergence of the Arabidopsis and rice lineages. All plant BGAL genes, with the exception of Arabidopsis BGAL17 and rice Os 9633.m04334, form a monophyletic group. Arabidopsis BGAL expression levels are much higher in mature leaves, roots, flowers, and siliques but are lower in young seedlings. BGAL8, BGAL11, BGAL13, BGAL14, and BGAL16 are expressed only in flowers. Catalytically active BGAL4 was produced in the E. coli and baculoviral expression systems, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, and partially characterized. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed p- and o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactosides. It also cleaved beta-(1,3)-, beta-(1,4)-, and beta-(1,6)-linked galactobiosides and galactotriosides, showing a marked preference for beta-(1,3)- and beta-(1,4)-linkages.
17499824	Serine racemases from barley, Hordeum vulgare L., and other plant species represent a distinct eukaryotic group: gene cloning and recombinant protein characterization.	2007	Phytochemistry	Several d-amino acids have been identified in plants. However, the biosynthetic pathway to them is unclear. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA encoding a serine racemase from barley which contained an open reading frame encoding 337 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant identity to plant and mammalian serine racemases and contained conserved pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-binding lysine and PLP-interacting amino acid residues. The purified gene product catalyzed not only racemization of serine but also dehydration of serine to pyruvate. The enzyme requires PLP and divalent cations such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), or Mn(2+), but not ATP, whereas mammalian serine racemase activity is increased by ATP. In addition to the results regarding the effect of ATP on enzyme activity and the phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic serine racemases, the antiserum against Arabidopsis serine racemase did not form a precipitate with barley and rice serine racemases. This suggests that plant serine racemases represent a distinct group in the eukaryotic serine racemase family and can be clustered into monocot and dicot types.
17524436	The rice (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase (OsTPS3) accounts for the major inducible volatile sesquiterpenes.	2007	Phytochemistry	Terpenoids serve as both constitutive and inducible defense chemicals in many plant species, and volatile terpenes participate in plant a indirect defense by attracting natural enemies of the herbivores. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 50 genes encoding putative terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report that two of the rice sesquiterpene synthase genes, OsTPS3 and OsTPS13, encode (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase and (E,E)-farnesol synthase, respectively. In vitro, the recombinant protein of OsTPS3 catalyzed formation of (E)-beta-caryophyllene and several other sesquiterpenes, including beta-elemene and alpha-humulene, all being components of inducible volatiles of rice plants. The transcript levels of OsTPS3 exhibit a circadian rhythm of fluctuation, and its expression was also greatly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In addition, expression of OsTPS3 in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in emitting high quantities of OsTPS3 products. We also overexpressed OsTPS3 in rice plants which then produced more (E)-beta-caryophyllene after MeJA treatment. Finally, we found that the MeJA-treated transgenic rice plants attracted more parasitoid wasps of Anagrus nilaparvatae than the wild-type. These results demonstrate that OsTPS3, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of volatile sesquiterpenes, plays a role in indirect defense of rice plants.
17512025	Progesterone: its occurrence in plants and involvement in plant growth.	2007	Phytochemistry	Progesterone is a mammalian gonadal hormone. In the current study, we identified and quantified progesterone in a range of higher plants by using GC-MS and examined its effects on the vegetative growth of plants. The growth of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings was promoted by progesterone at low concentrations but suppressed at higher concentrations under both light and dark growth conditions. The growth of the gibberellin-deficient mutant lh of pea (Pisum sativum) was also promoted by progesterone. An earlier study demonstrated that progesterone binds to MEMBRANE STEROID BINDING PROTEIN 1 (MSBP1) of Arabidopsis. In this work, we cloned the homologous genes of Arabidopsis, MSBP2 and STEROID BINDING PROTEIN (SBP), as well as of rice (Oryza sativa), OsMSBP1, OsMSBP2 and OsSBP and examined their expression in plant tissues. All of these genes, except OsMSBP1, were expressed abundantly in plant tissues. The roles of progesterone in plant growth were also discussed.
17532018	Growth inhibitory indole acetic acid polyacetylenic ester from Japanese ivy (Hedera rhombea Bean).	2007	Phytochemistry	Polyacetylenes 1 and 2 were isolated from extracts of Japanese ivy (Hedera rhombea Bean) flower buds, with their chemical structures established on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR and MS analyses. The absolute configurations of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by both chemical means, and by using the modified Mosher's method. Compound 1 is the first polyacetylene having an ester linkage between falcarindiol (3) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) moieties and 2 also had an unique substructure containing a conjugated diene adjacent to a hydroxy group. Polyacetylenes 1, 2, and 3 were also subjected to assessment of growth inhibition against the shoot and root growth of the monocotyledon plants, rice and perennial ryegrass, as well as the dicotyledons, cockscomb, lettuce, cress, and fenugreek. The most bioactive compound appeared to be compound 1, while 2 showed no activity. Compound 1 selectively showed growth inhibitory activity against dicotyledons.
17475294	GC-EI-TOF-MS analysis of in vivo carbon-partitioning into soluble metabolite pools of higher plants by monitoring isotope dilution after 13CO2 labelling.	None	Phytochemistry	The established GC-EI-TOF-MS method for the profiling of soluble polar metabolites from plant tissue was employed for the kinetic metabolic phenotyping of higher plants. Approximately 100 typical GC-EI-MS mass fragments of trimethylsilylated and methoxyaminated metabolite derivatives were structurally interpreted for mass isotopomer analysis, thus enabling the kinetic study of identified metabolites as well as the so-called functional group monitoring of yet non-identified metabolites. The monitoring of isotope dilution after (13)CO(2) labelling was optimized using Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 or Oryza sativa IR57111 plants, which were maximally labelled with (13)C. Carbon isotope dilution was evaluated for short (2h) and long-term (3 days) kinetic measurements of metabolite pools in root and shoots. Both approaches were shown to enable the characterization of metabolite specific partitioning processes and kinetics. Simplifying data reduction schemes comprising calculation of (13)C-enrichment from mass isotopomer distributions and of initial (13)C-dilution rates were employed. Metabolites exhibited a highly diverse range of metabolite and organ specific half-life of (13)C-label in their respective pools ((13)C-half-life). This observation implied the setting of metabolite specific periods for optimal kinetic monitoring. A current experimental design for the kinetic metabolic phenotyping of higher plants is proposed.
17512026	Metabolic flux analysis in plants using dynamic labeling technique: application to tryptophan biosynthesis in cultured rice cells.	None	Phytochemistry	The concept and methodology of using dynamic labeling for the MFA of plant metabolic pathways are described, based on a case study to develop a method for the MFA of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in cultured rice cells. Dynamic labeling traces the change in the labeling level of a metabolite in a metabolic pathway after the application of a stable isotope-labeled compound. In this study, [1-(13)C] l-serine was fed as a labeling precursor and the labeling level of Trp was determined by using the LC-MS/MS. The value of metabolic flux is determined by fitting a model describing the labeling dynamics of the pathway to the observed labeling data. The biosynthetic flux of Trp in rice suspension cultured cell was determined to be 6.0+/-1.1 nmol (gFWh)(-1). It is also demonstrated that an approximately sixfold increase in the biosynthetic flux of Trp in transgenic rice cells expressing the feedback-insensitive version of anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit gene (OASA1D) resulted in a 45-fold increase in the level of Trp. In this article, the basic workflow for the experiment is introduced and the details of the actual experimental procedures are explained. Future perspectives are also discussed by referring recent advances in the dynamic labeling approach.
17628621	Metabolism of indole-3-acetic acid in rice: identification and characterization of N-beta-D-glucopyranosyl indole-3-acetic acid and its conjugates.	2007	Phytochemistry	A search was made for conjugates of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in rice (Oryza sativa) using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) in order to elucidate unknown metabolic pathways for IAA. N-beta-d-Glucopyranosyl indole-3-acetic acid (IAA-N-Glc) was found in an alkaline hydrolysate of rice extract. A quantitative analysis of 3-week-old rice demonstrated that the total amount of IAA-N-Glc was equal to that of IAA. A LC-ESI-MS/MS-based analysis established that the major part of IAA-N-Glc was present as bound forms with aspartate and glutamate. Their levels were in good agreement with the total amount of IAA-N-Glc during the vegetative growth of rice. Further detailed analysis showed that both conjugates highly accumulated in the root. The free form of IAA-N-Glc accounted for 60% of the total in seeds but could not be detected in the vegetative tissue. An incorporation study using deuterium-labeled compounds showed that the amino acid conjugates of IAA-N-Glc were biosynthesized from IAA-amino acids. IAA-N-Glc and/or its conjugates were also found in extracts of Arabidopsis, Lotus japonicus, and maize, suggesting that N-glucosylation of indole can be the common metabolic pathway of IAA in plants.
18022655	Quantitative analysis of auxin-regulated proteins from basal part of leaf sheaths in rice by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.	2008	Phytochemistry	To identify the effects of auxin on rice root formation, proteins induced by exogenous addition of auxin to rice seedlings were analyzed by a proteomic approach. Root formation by rice seedlings was promoted by 0.45microM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and repressed by 60microM p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB). Proteins extracted from the basal part of leaf sheaths of rice seedlings treated with 2,4-D or PCIB for 48h were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, and separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Out of nine proteins up-regulated by 2,4-D and down-regulated by PCIB, five proteins showing significant difference in abundance were used for expression analysis at the transcript abundance level. Transcript abundance of the mitochondrial complex I subunit slightly increased with 2,4-D treatment and were repressed by PCIB. The transcript abundance of EF-1beta', myosin heavy chain and mitochondrial [Mn]SOD increased with 2,4-D treatment but did not decrease with PCIB. The transcript abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenase was not effected by 2,4-D or PCIB. These results indicate that mitochondrial complex I subunit is part of the downstream signal cascade of PCIB, whereas myosin heavy chain, mitochondrial [Mn]SOD and EF-1beta' are involved in the 2,4-D signal cascade but are probably upstream of PCIB.
17950386	Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole.	2008	Phytochemistry	Here, we report the first proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole (PBZ), an agricultural chemical that has been widely used to protect rice plants from rice blast and the bacterial blight pathogen. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was utilized to identify a total of 40 protein spots including 9 protein spots that are up-regulated by PBZ and 31 abundant protein spots. A total of 11 unique proteins from these 9 spots were identified by LC-MS/MS, and the majority of them were classified and/or possessed orthologs in defense-related functions. Five protein spots with only one protein species identified in each spot appear to be PBZ-regulated proteins. They are a putative glutathione S-transferase GSTU17, a putative phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, XP_466843), a putative caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a putative NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a putative glucose-1-phosphate adenyltransferase. However, the other six protein species identified from the remaining four protein spots could not be conclusively described as PBZ-regulated proteins due to either the co-migration of two protein species in one spot or the presence of one protein species in two spots. Through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), it was determined that PAL (XP_466843) is likely regulated at the protein level, whereas GSTU17 and COMT were regulated at the mRNA level after PBZ application. Interestingly, the mRNA transcripts of two PAL paralogs were found to be up-regulated by PBZ. We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis.
18045629	Effects of a bile acid elicitor, cholic acid, on the biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins in suspension-cultured rice cells.	2008	Phytochemistry	An elicitor of rice defense responses was recently isolated from human feces and was identified as cholic acid (CA). Pathogen infection in rice leaves induces phytocassanes and momilactones, both of which are major diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice, whereas CA mainly induces phytocassanes. We established a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry protocol for the rapid and accurate quantification of phytocassanes and momilactones. Using this method, we showed that CA preferentially induced the formation of phytocassanes in suspension-cultured rice cells, while a fungal chitin oligosaccharide elicitor induced that of both phytocassanes and momilactones. We further investigated the effects of CA on the expression of diterpene cyclase genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis. CA induced the transcription of the genes OsCPS2 (OsCyc2) and OsKSL7 (OsDTC1), which are involved in phytocassane biosynthesis, to a greater extent than the genes OsCPS4 (OsCyc1) and OsKSL4, which are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. OsCPS2 was particularly strongly induced, suggesting that it is one of the main mechanisms by which CA induces high levels of phytocassanes.
18191969	Iminosugars from Baphia nitida Lodd.	2008	Phytochemistry	Chromatographic separation of the 50% aqueous EtOH extract of the leaves of the African medicinal tree Baphia nitida resulted in isolation of 10 iminosugars. The plant contained 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R,4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) as a major alkaloid. The structure of a new alkaloid was also elucidated by spectroscopic methods as the 1-O-beta-D-fructofuranoside of DMDP, and this plant produced 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-DMDP as well. DMDP is a potent inhibitor of beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, whereas the other two derivatives lowered inhibition toward both of these enzymes and improved inhibitory activities toward rice alpha-glucosidase and rat intestinal maltase.
16275658	Large-scale systematic study on stability of the Ds element and timing of transposition in rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) transposon mutagenesis is a widely used tool for gene identification; however, several reports on silencing of the Ac/Ds element in starter lines and in stable transposants question the applicability of such an approach in later generations. We have performed a systematic analysis on various aspects of the silencing phenomenon in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare). High somatic and germinal transposition frequencies observed in earlier generations were maintained as late as T4 and T5 generations; thus the propagation of parental lines did not induce transposon silencing. Moreover, the stably transposed Ds element was active even at the F5 generation, since Ac could remobilize the Ds element as indicated by the footprint analysis of several revertants. Expression of the bar gene was monitored from F3 to F6 generations in >1,000 lines. Strikingly, substantial transgene silencing was not observed in any of the generations tested. We analyzed the timing of transposition during rice development and provide evidence that Ds is transposed late after tiller formation. The possibility, that the independent events could be the result of secondary transposition, was ruled out by analyzing potential footprints by reciprocal PCR. Our study validates the Ac/Ds system as a tool for large-scale mutagenesis in rice, since the Ds elements were active in the starter and insertion lines even in the later generations. We propose that harvesting rice seeds using their panicles is an alternative way to increase the number of independent transposants due to post-tillering transposition.
16275657	Expression of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger, OsCAX1a, in rice: cell and age specificity of expression, and enhancement by Ca2+.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Calcium is an essential macronutrient for plants and functions in signal transduction. Regulation of the cytosolic calcium concentration is required for normal cell growth. In calcium homeostasis in plant cells, Ca(2+)/H(+) exchangers are involved in Ca(2+) compartmentalization into intracellular compartments. Here, we examine the intracellular localization of a rice Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger, OsCAX1a, fused to a green fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in onion epidermis and rice protoplasts. Green fluorescence was observed in the vacuolar membrane. After sucrose gradient centrifugation of the homogenate of rice plants, OsCAX1a was detected in the same fraction as the vacuolar membrane aquaporin gamma-TIP. We then quantified the mRNA and protein of OsCAX1a in plants grown with metal ions. OsCAX1a mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+). The protein level in shoots was also increased in the presence of high concentrations of Ca(2+). Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the OsCAX1a promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers. In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of OsCAX1a was particularly high in aged organs. These results suggest that OsCAX1a transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+).
16284406	Functional analysis of rice DREB1/CBF-type transcription factors involved in cold-responsive gene expression in transgenic rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	The transcription factors dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1s (DREB1s)/C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs) specifically interact with the DRE/CRT cis-acting element and control the expression of many stress-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. The genes for DREB1 orthologs, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B from rice, are induced by cold stress, and overexpression of DREB1 or OsDREB1 induced strong expression of stress-responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, resulting in increased tolerance to high-salt and freezing stresses. In this study, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsDREB1 or DREB1 genes. These transgenic rice plants showed not only growth retardation under normal growth conditions but also improved tolerance to drought, high-salt and low-temperature stresses like the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB1 or DREB1. We also detected elevated contents of osmoprotectants such as free proline and various soluble sugars in the transgenic rice as in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. We identified target stress-inducible genes of OsDREB1A in the transgenic rice using microarray and RNA gel blot analyses. These genes encode proteins that are thought to function in stress tolerance in the plants. These results indicate that the DREB1/CBF cold-responsive pathway is conserved in rice and the DREB1-type genes are quite useful for improvement of stress tolerance to environmental stresses in various kinds of transgenic plants including rice.
16299003	A novel function of abscisic acid in the regulation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) root growth and development.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant roots retain developmental plasticity and respond to environmental stresses or exogenous plant growth regulators by undergoing profound morphological and physiological alteration. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous ABA on root growth and development in Taichung native 1 (TN1) rice. Exogenous application of 10 microM ABA leads to swelling, root hair formation and initiation of lateral root primodia in the tips of young, seminal rice roots. Cortex cells increased in size and were irregularly shaped. ABA treatment significantly increased 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reductase ability in the root tips and the exudation rate of xylem sap. In addition, the K(+) ion content in xylem sap increased nearly 2-fold, but not that of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+). Analysis of proteins expressed in the root tips identified several ABA-induced or -repressed proteins, including actin depolymerization factor (ADF), late embryo abundant protein (LEA), putative steroid membrane-binding protein, ferredoxin thionine reductase and calcium-binding protein. The effects of ABA on root morphogenesis change were Ca(2+) dependent and required the participation of calmodulin and de novo protein synthesis. A model is presented that illustrates how ABA acts through a potential cellular and signal transduction mechanism to induce morphological and physiological changes in rice roots.
16306061	EUI1, encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, regulates internode elongation by modulating gibberellin responses in rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Elongation of rice internodes is one of the most important agronomic traits, which determines the plant height and underlies the grain yield. It has been shown that the elongation of internodes is under genetic control, and various factors are implicated in the process. Here, we report a detailed characterization of an elongated uppermost internode1 (eui1) mutant, which has been used in hybrid rice breeding. In the eui1-2 mutant, the cell lengths in the uppermost internodes are significantly longer than that of wild type and thus give rise to the elongated uppermost internode. It was found that the level of active gibberellin was elevated in the mutant, whereas its growth in response to gibberellin is similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the higher level accumulation of gibberellin in the eui1 mutant causes the abnormal elongation of the uppermost internode. Consistently, the expression levels of several genes which encode gibberellin biosynthesis enzymes were altered. We cloned the EUI1 gene, which encodes a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, by map-based cloning and found that EUI1 was weakly expressed in most tissues, but preferentially in young panicles. To confirm its function, transgenic experiments with different constructs of EUI1 were conducted. Overexpression of EUI1 gave rise to the gibberellin-deficient-like phenotypes, which could be partially reversed by supplementation with gibberellin. Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of SLR1 protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated SLR1 destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis. Therefore, we proposed that EUI1 plays a negative role in gibberellin-mediated regulation of cell elongation in the uppermost internode of rice.
16352697	Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a negative regulator of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC) that plays a key role in intermediary metabolism. OsPDK1 was identified as a gibberellin-up-regulated gene using a cDNA microarray. The full-length cDNA for OsPDK1 was 1498 bp and encoded a predicted polypeptide of 363 amino acids. Genomic DNA analysis showed the presence of another isoform of PDK, OsPDK2, in rice. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed differential expression of the two isoforms. OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined. Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h. OsPDK1 expression was up-regulated by GA3, and there was little effect of other plant hormones. Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity was reduced compared with control plants in 2-week-old seedlings treated with GA3. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath. Transgenic rice expressing PDK1 RNAi had altered vegetative growth with reduced accumulation of vegetative tissues. These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development.
16614094	The correlation between expression and localization of a foreign gene product in rice endosperm.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a 30 amino acid peptide hormone involved in insulin stimulation that is dependent upon blood glucose levels. We have previously reported that when this short peptide gene was directly expressed under the control of a glutelin promoter and its signal peptide, it was not accumulated in transgenic rice seed due to gene silencing. However, when the modified GLP-1 (mGLP-1) gene was enlarged to 5xmGLP-1 (mGLPx5) by tandem repeat, no silencing was observed. The mGLPx5 peptide could be accumulated in rice seed and its localization was mainly limited to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also investigated alternative cellular localization sites that would increase accumulation. The relationship between the expression level and localization was examined by attaching the chitinase signal peptide to mGLPx5 to direct it into the intercellular space (apoplast), or by expression as a fusion protein with glutelin by insertion into a variable region of the acidic subunit, thus directing the peptide to protein body II (PB II). Attachment of the KDEL ER retention signal to the 6xmGLP-1 (mGLPx6) or its fusion to the C-terminus of the 13 kDa prolamin directed the peptide to the ER or PB I, respectively. Unexpectedly, these results indicated that mGLPx5 without any signal except for the glutelin signal peptide was accumulated to the greatest extent in rice endosperm. It can thus be concluded that the ER is a suitable intracellular organelle for accumulation of mGLPx5 peptide.
16774928	Dynamic and reversible changes in histone H3-Lys4 methylation and H3 acetylation occurring at submergence-inducible genes in rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation in the chromatin surrounding a gene are thought to regulate transcriptional activity. In this study, to determine whether dynamic changes occur in histone modification on the loci of stress-responsive genes in plants, we chose rice submergence-inducible ADH1 and PDC1 genes. When submerged, the rice ADH1 and PDC1 genes were activated in a biphasic manner: the first and second inductions occurred after approximately 2 and 12 h of submergence, respectively. Their expression was transcriptionally induced as shown by increased binding of RNA polymerase II to the ADH1 and PDC1 loci during submergence. The Lys4 residues of the histone H3 proteins (H3-K4s) at both the 5'- and 3'-coding regions of ADH1 and PDC1 were found to change from a di-methylated state to a tri-methylated state at the first induction period. On the other hand, acetylation of H3 increased throughout ADH1 and PDC1 genes at the later induction period. The methylation and acetylation levels recovered to the initial levels during re-aeration. Treatment of seedlings with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, increased acetylation of histones H3 and association of RNA polymerase II on the ADH1 and PDC1 loci, thereby increasing transcript levels of ADH1 and PDC1. Together, these results showed dynamic and reversible changes of histone H3-K4 methylation and H3 acetylation in stress-responsive genes in a higher plant in response to the appearance or disappearance of an environmental stress.
16816407	Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a pivotal role in the hypersensitive response (HR) in disease resistance. NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROI; however, the mechanisms of its regulation are unclear. Rice spl mutants spontaneously form lesions which resemble those occurring during the HR, suggesting that the mutations affect regulation of the HR. We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor. Increased accumulation of ROIs was suppressed by inhibition of NADPH oxidase in the spl cells, and was also observed in the ozone-exposed spl plants. These mutants have sufficient activities of ROI-scavenging enzymes compared with the wild type. In addition, spl7 mutant cells accumulated higher amounts of H(2)O(2) when treated with calyculin A (CA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatase. Furthermore, spl2 mutant plants exhibited accelerated accumulation of H(2)O(2) and increased rates of cell death in response to wounding. These results suggest that the spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutants are defective in the regulation of NADPH oxidase, and the spl7 mutation may give rise to enhancement of the signaling pathway which protein dephosphorylation controls, while the spl2 mutation affects both the pathogen-induced and wound-induced signaling pathways.
17132630	Comparative overviews of clock-associated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	In higher plants, circadian rhythms are highly relevant to a wide range of biological processes. To such circadian rhythms, the clock (oscillator) is central, and recent intensive studies on the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the central clock. Such representative clock-associated genes of A. thaliana are the homologous CCA1 and LHY genes, and five PRR genes that belong to a small family of pseudo-response regulators including TOC1. Others are GI, ZTL, ELF3, ELF4, LUX/PCL1, etc. In this context, a simple question arose as to whether or not the molecular picture of the model Arabidopsis clock is conserved in other higher plants. Here we made an effort to answer the question with special reference to Oryza sativa, providing experimental evidence that this model monocot also has a set of highly conserved clock-associated genes, such as those designated as OsCCA1, OsPRR-series including OsTOC1/OsPRR1, OsZTLs, OsPCL1 as well as OsGI. These results will provide us with insight into the general roles of plant circadian clocks, such as those for the photoperiodic control of flowering time that has a strong impact on the reproduction and yield in many higher plants.
17468126	Stable oil bodies sheltered by a unique oleosin in lily pollen.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Stable oil bodies were purified from mature lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) pollen. The integrity of pollen oil bodies was maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance possibly provided by their surface proteins. Immunodetection revealed that a major protein of 18 kDa was exclusively present in pollen oil bodies and massively accumulated in late stages of pollen maturation. According to mass spectrometric analyses, this oil body protein possessed a tryptic fragment of 13 residues matching that of a theoretical rice oleosin. A complete cDNA fragment encoding this putative oleosin was obtained by PCR cloning with primers derived from its known 13-residue sequence. Sequence analysis as well as immunological non-cross-reactivity suggests that this pollen oleosin represents a distinct class in comparison with oleosins found in seed oil bodies and tapetum. In pollen cells observed by electron microscopy, oil bodies were presumably surrounded by tubular membrane structures, and encapsulated in the vacuoles after germination. It seems that pollen oil bodies are mobilized via a different route from that of glyoxysomal mobilization of seed oil bodies after germination.
17517758	Probenazole-induced accumulation of salicylic acid confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea in adult rice plants.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Probenazole (PBZ) is the active ingredient of Oryzemate, an agrochemical which is used for the protection of rice plants from Magnaporthe grisea (blast fungus). While PBZ was reported to function upstream of salicylic acid (SA) in Arabidopsis, little is known about the mechanism of PBZ-induced resistance in rice. The role of SA in blast fungus resistance is also unclear. The recommended application period for Oryzemate is just before the Japanese rainy season, at which time rice plants in the field have reached the 8-leaf stage with adult traits. Thus, the involvement of SA in PBZ-induced resistance was studied in compatible and incompatible blast fungus-rice interactions at two developmentally different leaf morphology stages. Pre-treatment of inoculated fourth leaves of young wild-type rice plants at the 4-leaf stage with PBZ did not influence the development of whitish expanding lesions (ELs) in the susceptible interaction without the accumulation of SA and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. However, PBZ pre-treatment increased accumulation of SA and PR proteins in the eighth leaves of adult plants at the 8-leaf stage, resulting in the formation of hypersensitive reaction (HR) lesions (HRLs). Exogenous SA induced resistance in adult but not young plants. SA concentrations in blast fungus-inoculated young leaves were essentially the same in compatible and incompatible interactions, suggesting that PBZ-induced resistance in rice is age-dependently regulated via SA accumulation.
17567639	Localization and topogenesis studies of cytoplasmic and vacuolar homologs of the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	The Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) is synthesized as a preproprotein. To corroborate the role of the different targeting peptides in the topogenesis of GNA and related proteins, different constructs were made whereby both the complete original GNA gene and different truncated sequences were coupled to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). In addition, a GNA ortholog from rice that lacks the signal peptide and C-terminal propeptide sequence was fused to EGFP. These fusion constructs were expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells and their localization analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We observed that the processed preproprotein of GNA was directed towards the vacuolar compartment, whereas both the truncated forms of GNA corresponding to the mature lectin polypeptide and the rice ortholog of GNA were located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It can be concluded, therefore, that removal of the C-terminal propeptide and the signal peptide is sufficient to change the subcellular targeting of a normally vacuolar protein to the nuclear/cytoplasmic compartment of the BY-2 cells. These findings support the proposed hypothesis that cytoplasmic/nuclear GNA-like proteins and their vacuolar homologs are evolutionarily related and that the classical GNA-related lectins might have evolved from cytoplasmic orthologs through an evolutionary event involving the insertion of a signal peptide and a C-terminal propeptide.
17566055	A nitrite transporter associated with nitrite uptake by higher plant chloroplasts.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Chloroplasts take up cytosolic nitrite during nitrate assimilation. In this study we identified a nitrite transporter located in the chloroplasts of higher plants. The transporter, CsNitr1-L, a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (POT) family, was detected during light-induced chloroplast development in de-etiolating cucumber seedlings. We detected a CsNitr1-L-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in the chloroplasts of leaf cells and found that an immunoreactive 51 kDa protein was present in the isolated inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. CsNitr1-L has an isoform, CsNitr1-S, with an identical 484 amino acid core sequence; however, in CsNitr1-S the 120 amino acid N-terminal extension is missing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing CsNitr1-S absorbed nitrite from an acidic medium at a slower rate than mock-transformed control cells, and accumulated nitrite to only one-sixth the concentration of the control cells, suggesting that CsNitr1-S enhances the efflux of nitrite from the cell. Insertion of T-DNA in a single CsNitr1-L homolog (At1g68570) in Arabidopsis resulted in nitrite accumulation in leaves to more than five times the concentration found in the wild type. These results show that it is possible that both CsNitr1-L and CsNitr1-S encode efflux-type nitrite transporters, but with different subcellular localizations. CsNitr1-L may possibly load cytosolic nitrite into chloroplast stroma in the chloroplast envelope during nitrate assimilation. The presence of genes homologous to CsNitr1-L in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice indicates that facilitated nitrite transport is of general physiological importance in plant nutrition.
17597080	Transactivation of protein expression by rice HSP101 in planta and using Hsp101 as a selection marker for transformation.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant HSP101 has dual activities, first, in conferring thermotolerance, and secondly, in serving as a translational activator. In this study, we introduced Oryza sativa Hsp101 (osHsp101) cDNA into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Stable integration and expression of the transgene into the tobacco genome was demonstrated by Southern and Western blot analysis. Overexpression of osHSP101 had no noticeable effect on growth or development of the transgenic plants. Homozygous T(2) transgenic plants with overexpressed osHSP101 survived heat treatment better than untransformed control plants. In addition, taking advantage of conferring basal thermotolerance by plant HSP101, we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of using osHsp101 as a selection marker and select the transformants under high temperature in tobacco leaf disc transformation mediated by Agrobacterium. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco plants with overexpressed osHSP101 were able to enhance luciferase expression up to 2.9-fold more than untransformed plants in the progeny of reciprocally crossed with omega-luciferase reporter lines.
17609219	A rice dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase (DSH1) gene, which is abundantly expressed in the stigmas, vascular cells and apical meristem, may be involved in fertility.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of phytosphingosine, a major constituent of sphingolipids in plants and yeasts. The rice genome contains five homologue genes for dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase, DSH1-DSH5, whose gene products show high degrees of homology to the yeast counterpart, SUR2. Among them, expression of DSH1, DSH2 and DSH4 was detected, and DSH1 and DSH4 complement the yeast sur2 mutation. The DSH1 gene was specifically and abundantly expressed in vascular bundles and apical meristems. In particular, very strong expression was detected in the stigmas of flowers. Repression of DSH1 expression by the antisense gene or RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a severe reduction of fertility. In the transformants in which DSH1 expression was suppressed, significantly increased expression of DSH2 was found in leaves but not in pistils, suggesting that there was tissue-specific correlation between DSH1 and DSH2 expression. Our results indicate that the product of DSH1 may be involved in plant viability or reproductive processes, and that the phenotype of sterility is apparently caused by loss of function of DSH1 in the stigma. It is also suggested that there is a complex mechanism controlling the tissue-specific expression of the DSH1 gene.
17634180	A wilty mutant of rice has impaired hydraulic conductance.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice CM2088 mutant is the wilty phenotype and wilts markedly under well-watered sunny conditions. The leaf water potential and epidermal (mainly stomatal) conductance of CM2088 plants decreased significantly under conditions that induced intense transpiration, as compared with those of wild-type plants, revealing that the wilty phenotype was not the result of abnormal stomatal behavior but was due to an increase in resistance to water transport. The resistance to water transport was dramatically elevated in the node and the sheath and blade of a leaf of the mutant, but not in the root or stem. The diameter of xylem vessels in the large vascular bundles of the leaf sheath and the internode tended to be small, and the numbers of vessel elements with narrowed or scalariform perforation plates in the leaf blade and sheath were greater in the mutant than in the wild type. Most xylem vessels were occluded, with air bubbles in the leaf sheath of the mutant during the midday hours under intense transpiration conditions, while no bubbles were observed in plants that were barely transpiring, revealing that the significant increase in resistance to water transport was a result of the cavitation. The additive effects of cavitation in xylem vessels and the decreased diameter and deformed plates of vessel elements might be responsible for the wilty phenotype of CM2088.
17693452	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Cold temperatures cause pollen sterility and large reductions in grain yield in temperate rice growing regions of the world. Induction of pollen sterility by cold involves a disruption of sugar transport in anthers, caused by the cold-induced repression of the apoplastic sugar transport pathway in the tapetum. Here we demonstrate that the phytohormone ABA is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility (CIPS). Cold treatment of the cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara resulted in increased anther ABA levels. Exogenous ABA treatment at the young microspore stage induced pollen sterility and affected cell wall invertase and monosaccharide transporter gene expression in a way similar to cold treatment. In the cold-tolerant cultivar R31, ABA levels were significantly lower under normal circumstances and remained low after cold treatment. The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers. The expression of three ABA-8-hydroxylase genes (ABA8OX1, 2 and 3) in R31 anthers was higher under control conditions and was regulated differently by cold compared with Doongara. Our results indicate that the cold tolerance phenotype of R31 is correlated with lower endogenous ABA levels and a different regulation of ABA metabolism.
17804480	Temperature response of photosynthesis in transgenic rice transformed with 'sense' or 'antisense' rbcS.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	The responses of chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange rate and Rubisco activation state to temperature were examined in transgenic rice plants with 130 and 35% of the wild-type (WT) Rubisco content by transformation with rbcS cDNA in sense and antisense orientations, respectively. Although the optimal temperatures of PSII quantum efficiency and CO(2) assimilation were found to be between 25 and 32 degrees C, the maximal activation state of Rubisco was found to be between 16 and 20 degrees C in all genotypes. The Rubisco flux control coefficient was also the highest between 16 and 20 degrees C in the WT and antisense lines [>0.88 at an intercellular CO(2) pressure (Ci) of 28 Pa]. Gross photosynthesis at Ci = 28 Pa per Rubisco content in the WT between 12 and 20 degrees C was close to that of the antisense lines where high Rubisco control is present. Thus, Rubisco activity most strongly limited photosynthesis at cool temperatures. These results indicated that a selective enhancement of Rubisco content can enhance photosynthesis at cool temperatures, but in the sense line with enhanced Rubisco content Pi regeneration limitation occurred. Above 20 degrees C, the Rubisco flux control coefficient declined. This decline was associated with a decline in Rubisco activation. The activation state of Rubisco measured at each temperature decreased with increasing Rubisco content, and the slope of activation to Rubisco content was independent of temperature. We discuss the possibility that the decline in Rubisco activation at intermediate and high temperatures is part of a regulated response to a limitation in other photosynthetic processes.
18003669	Identification of boron transporter genes likely to be responsible for tolerance to boron toxicity in wheat and barley.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Tolerance to boron (B) toxicity in cereals is known to be associated with reduced tissue accumulation of B. Genes from roots of B-tolerant cultivars of wheat and barley with high similarities to previously reported B efflux transporters from Arabidopsis and rice were cloned. Expression of these genes was strongly correlated with the ability of tolerant genotypes to lower the concentration of B in roots. The gene from barley located to chromosome 4. Backcross lines containing a B tolerance locus on chromosome 4 showed tolerance in proportion to the level of expression of the transporter gene, whereas those lacking the locus were sensitive to B and had very low levels of gene expression. The results are consistent with a widespread mechanism of tolerance to high B based on efflux of B from root cells.
17981875	A cell-free translation and proteoliposome reconstitution system for functional analysis of plant solute transporters.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	We describe here a novel proteoliposome reconstitution system for functional analysis of plant membrane transporters that is based on a modified wheat germ cell-free translation system. We established optimized conditions for the reconstitution system with Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator 1 (AtPPT1) as a model transporter. A high activity of AtPPT1 was achieved by synthesis of the protein in the presence of both a detergent such as Brij35 and liposomes. We also determined the substrate specificities of three putative rice PPT homologs with this system. The cell-free proteoliposome reconstitution system provides a valuable tool for functional analysis of transporter proteins.
18037673	Three type-B response regulators, ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12, play essential but redundant roles in cytokinin signal transduction throughout the life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Arabidopsis thaliana has 11 members belonging to the typical type-B ARR (authentic response regulator) family. Among them, seven highly homologous members appear also to be conserved in rice (Oryza sativa), but others are not. It was suggested that these seven ARRs are commonly implicated as DNA-binding transcription factors in the phosphorelay-mediated cytokinin signal transduction network in higher plants. To gain an insight into the functions of the cytokinin-associated type-B ARRs, we previously investigated an arr1 arr10 arr12 triple mutant and reported that it exhibited stunted growth and abnormality in vascular development. Based on this fact, here we attempted to characterize the mutant intensively with reference to cytokinin-associated phenotypes through the life cycle. We showed that the observed cytokinin-associated phenotypes of arr1 arr10 arr12 were very severe and highly analogous to those observed for certain ahk2 ahk3 ahk4/cre1 triple mutants, which have virtually no cytokinin receptor to propagate the phosphorelay signal transduction network. Among the seven ARR members belonging to the cytokinin-associated type-B ARR subfamily, it was thus suggested that ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 together play essential (or general) roles in cytokinin signal transduction. It is therefore conceivable that the other type-B ARRs (ARR2, ARR11, ARR14 and ARR18) might play more specific roles spatially and temporally in plants.
18296724	Identification of dynamin as an interactor of rice GIGANTEA by tandem affinity purification (TAP).	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) regulate photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. In rice, OsGI, Hd1 and Hd3a were identified as orthologs of GI, CO and FT, respectively, and are also important regulators of flowering. Although GI has roles in both flowering and the circadian clock, our understanding of its biochemical functions is still limited. In this study, we purified novel OsGI-interacting proteins by using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method. The TAP method has been used effectively in a number of model species to isolate proteins that interact with proteins of interest. However, in plants, the TAP method has been used in only a few studies, and no novel proteins have previously been isolated by this method. We generated transgenic rice plants and cell cultures expressing a TAP-tagged version of OsGI. After a two-step purification procedure, the interacting proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Seven proteins, including dynamin, were identified as OsGI-interacting proteins. The interaction of OsGI with dynamin was verified by co-immunoprecipitation using a myc-tagged version of OsGI. Moreover, an analysis of Arabidopsis dynamin mutants indicated that although the flowering times of the mutants were not different from those of wild-type plants, an aerial rosette phenotype was observed in the mutants. We also found that OsGI is present in both the nucleus and the cytosol by Western blot analysis and by transient assays. These results indicate that the TAP method is effective for the isolation of novel proteins that interact with target proteins in plants.
18252732	The chilling injury induced by high root temperature in the leaves of rice seedlings.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Root temperature is found to be a very important factor for leaves to alter the response and susceptibility to chilling stress. Severe visible damage was observed in the most active leaves of seedlings of a japonica rice (Oryza sativa cv. Akitakomachi), e.g. the third leaf at the third-leaf stage, after the treatment where only leaves but not roots were chilled (L/H). On the other hand, no visible damage was observed after the treatment where both leaves and roots were chilled simultaneously (L/L). The chilling injury induced by L/H, a novel type of chilling injury, required the light either during or after the chilling in order to develop the visible symptoms such as leaf bleaching and tissue necrosis. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters measured after various lengths of chilling treatments showed that significant changes were induced before the visible injury. The effective quantum yield and photochemical quenching of PSII dropped dramatically within 24 h in both the presence and absence of a 12 h light period. The maximal quantum yield and non-photochemical quenching of PSII decreased significantly only in the presence of light. On the other hand, L/H chilling did not affect the function of PSI, but caused a significant decrease in the electron availability for PSI. These results suggest that the leaf chilling with high root temperature destroys some component between PSII and PSI without the aid of light, which causes the over-reduction of PSII in the light, and thereby the visible injury is induced only in the light.
18037610	Tissue and cell-specific localization of rice aquaporins and their water transport activities.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Water transport in plants is greatly dependent on the expression and activity of water transport channels, called aquaporins. Here, we have clarified the tissue- and cell-specific localization of aquaporins in rice plants by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry using seven isoform-specific aquaporin antibodies. We also examined water transport activities of typical aquaporin family members using a yeast expression system in combination with a stopped-flow spectrophotometry assay. OsPIP1 members, OsPIP2;1, OsTIP1;1 and OsTIP2;2 were expressed in both leaf blades and roots, while OsPIP2;3, OsPIP2;5 and OsTIP2;1 were expressed only in roots. In roots, large amounts of aquaporins accumulated in the region adjacent to the root tip (around 1.5-4 mm from the root tip). In this region, cell-specific localization of the various aquaporin members was observed. OsPIP1 members and OsTIP2;2 accumulated predominantly in the endodermis and the central cylinder, respectively. OsTIP1;1 showed specific localization in the rhizodermis and exodermis. OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;3 and OsPIP2;5 accumulated in all root cells, but they showed higher levels of accumulation in endodermis than other cells. In the region at 35 mm from the root tip, where aerenchyma develops, aquaporins accumulated at low levels. In leaf blades, OsPIP1 members and OsPIP2;1 were localized mainly in mesophyll cells. OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;3, OsPIP2;5 and OsTIP2;2 expressed in yeast showed high water transport activities. These results suggest that rice aquaporins with various water transport activities may play distinct roles in facilitating water flux and maintaining the water potential in different tissues and cells.
16944204	Putative fasciclin-like arabinogalactan-proteins (FLA) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa): identification and bioinformatic analyses.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Putative plant adhesion molecules include arabinogalactan-proteins having fasciclin-like domains. In animal, fasciclin proteins participate in cell adhesion and communication. However, the molecular basis of interactions in plants is still unknown and none of these domains have been characterized in cereals. This work reports the characterization of 34 wheat (Triticum aestivum) and 24 rice (Oryza sativa) Fasciclin-Like Arabinogalactan-proteins (FLAs). Bioinformatics analyses show that cereal FLAs share structural characteristics with known Arabidopsis FLAs including arabinogalactan-protein and fasciclin conserved domains. At least 70% of the wheat and rice FLAs are predicted to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the plasma membranes. Expression analyses determined from the relative abundance of ESTs in the publicly available wheat EST databases and from RNA gel blots indicate that most of these genes are weakly expressed and found mainly in seeds and roots. Furthermore, most wheat genes were down regulated by abiotic stresses except for TaFLA9 and 12 where cold treatment induces their expression in roots. Plant fasciclin-like domains were predicted to have 3-D homology with FAS1 domain of the fasciclin I insect neural cell adhesion molecule with an estimated precision above 70%. The structural analysis shows that negatively charged amino acids are concentrated along the beta1-alpha3-alpha4-beta2 edges, while the positively charged amino acids are concentrated on the back side of the folds. This highly charged surface distribution could provide a way of mediating protein-protein interactions via electrostatic forces similar to many other adhesion molecules. The identification of wheat FLAs will facilitate studying their function in plant growth and development and their role in stress response.
17103227	Arabidopsis-rice-wheat gene orthologues for Na+ transport and transcript analysis in wheat-L. elongatum aneuploids under salt stress.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Lophopyrum elongatum is a wild relative of wheat that provides a source of novel genes for improvement of the salt tolerance of bread wheat. Improved Na(+) 'exclusion' is associated with salt tolerance in a wheat-L. elongatum amphiploid, in which a large proportion (ca. 50%) of the improved regulation of leaf Na(+) concentrations is controlled by chromosome 3E. In this study, genes that might control Na(+) accumulation, such as for transporters responsible for Na(+) entry (HKT1) and exit (SOS1) from cells, or compartmentalisation within vacuoles (NHX1, NHX5, AVP1, AVP2) in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, were targeted for comparative analyses in wheat. Putative rice orthologues were identified and characterised as a means to bridge the large evolutionary distance between genomes from the model dicot and the more complex grass species. Wheat orthologues were identified through BLAST searching to identify either FL-cDNAs or ESTs and were subsequently used to design primers to amplify genomic DNA. The probable orthologous status of the wheat genes was confirmed through demonstration of similar intron-exon structure with their counterparts in Arabidopsis and rice. The majority of exons for Arabidopsis, rice and wheat orthologues of NHX1, NHX5 and SOS1 were conserved except for those at the amino and carboxy terminal ends. However, additional exons were identified in the predicted NHX1 and SOS1 genes of rice and wheat, as compared with Arabidopsis, indicating gene rearrangement events during evolution from a common ancestor. Nullisomic-tetrasomic, deletion and addition lines in wheat were used to assign gene sequences to chromosome regions in wheat and L. elongatum. Most sequences were assigned to homoeologous chromosomes, however, in some instances, such as for SOS1, genes were mapped to other unpredicted locations. Differential transcript abundance under salt stress indicated a complex pattern of expression for wheat orthologues that may regulate Na(+) accumulation in wheat lines containing chromosomes from L. elongatum. The identification of wheat orthologues to well characterized Arabidopsis genes, map locations and gene expression profiles increases our knowledge on the complex mechanisms regulating Na(+) transport in wheat and wheat-L. elongatum lines under salt stress.
17216490	Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Members of the YABBY gene family have a general role that promotes abaxial cell fate in a model eudicot, Arabidopsis thaliana. To understand the function of YABBY genes in monocots, we have isolated all YABBY genes in Oryza sativa (rice), and revealed the spatial and temporal expression pattern of one of these genes, OsYABBY1. In rice, eight YABBY genes constitute a small gene family and are classified into four groups according to sequence similarity, exon-intron structure, and organ-specific expression patterns. OsYABBY1 shows unique spatial expression patterns that have not previously been reported for other YABBY genes, so far. OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves. In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages. The OsYABBY1-expressing domains are closely associated with cells that subsequently differentiate into sclerenchymatous cells. These findings suggest that the function of OsYABBY1 is involved in regulating the differentiation of a few specific cell types and is unrelated to polar regulation of lateral organ development.
17404758	The rice OsLOL2 gene encodes a zinc finger protein involved in rice growth and disease resistance.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Arabidopsis LSD1-related proteins that contain LSD1-like zinc finger domains have been identified to be involved in disease resistance and programmed cell death. To investigate the potential role of LSD1-related gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we cloned an LSD1 ortholog, OsLOL2, from the rice cDNA plasmid library. The OsLOL2 gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 163 amino acids with two LSD1-like zinc finger domains with 74.5% identity to those of LSD1. Southern blot analysis indicated that OsLOL2 was a single-copy gene in the rice genome. Transgenic rice lines carrying the antisense strand of OsLOL2 with decreased expression of OsLOL2 had dwarf phenotypes, and the dwarfism could be restored by exogenous GA(3) treatment, suggesting that the dwarfism was the result of a deficiency in bioactive gibberellin (GA). In agreement with this possibility, the content of endogenous bioactive GA(1) decreased in the antisense transgenic lines. Expression of OsKS1, one of the genes encoding for GA biosynthetic enzymes, was suppressed in the antisense transgenic lines. Sense transgenic lines with increased expression of OsLOL2 were more resistant to rice bacterial blight, while antisense transgenic lines were less resistant to rice bacterial blight. The OsLOL2-GFP (green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of cells of transgenic BY2 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). These data suggest that OsLOL2 is involved in rice growth and disease resistance.
17169384	A proteomics approach for identifying osmotic-stress-related proteins in rice.	2007	Phytochemistry	Osmotic stress can endanger the survival of plants. To investigate the mechanisms of how plants respond to osmotic stress, rice protein profiles from mannitol-treated plants, were monitored using a proteomics approach. Two-week-old rice seedlings were treated with 400mM mannitol for 48h. After separation of proteins from the basal part of leaf sheaths by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 327 proteins were detected. The levels of 12 proteins increased and the levels of three proteins decreased with increasing concentration or duration, of mannitol treatment. Levels of a heat shock protein and a dnaK-type molecular chaperone were reduced under osmotic, cold, salt and drought stresses, and ABA treatment, whereas a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit was found to be responsive only to osmotic stress. Furthermore, proteins whose accumulation was sensitive to osmotic stress are present in an osmotic-tolerant cultivar. These results indicate that specific proteins expressed in the basal part of rice leaf sheaths show a coordinated response to cope with osmotic stress.
17078983	Carboxylesterase activities toward pesticide esters in crops and weeds.	2006	Phytochemistry	Proteins were extracted from maize, rice, sorghum, soybean, flax and lucerne; the weeds Abutilon theophrasti, Echinochloa crus-galli, Phalaris canariensis, Setaria faberii, Setaria viridis, Sorghum halepense and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and assayed for carboxylesterase activity toward a range of xenobiotics. These included the pro-herbicidal esters clodinafop-propargyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl, fenthioprop-ethyl, methyl-2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d-methyl), bromoxynil-octanoate, the herbicide-safener cloquintocet-mexyl and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin. Highest activities were recorded with alpha-naphthyl acetate and methylumbelliferyl acetate. Esters of p-nitrophenol were also readily hydrolysed, with turnover declining as the chain length of the acyl component increased. Activities determined with model substrates were much higher than those observed with pesticide esters and were of limited value in predicting the relative rates of hydrolysis of the crop protection agents. Substrate preferences with the herbicides were typically 2,4-d-methyl>clodinafop-propargyl>fenthioprop-ethyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl and bromoxynil-octanoate. Isoelectric focussing in conjunction with staining for esterase activity using alpha-naphthyl acetate as substrate confirmed the presence of multiple carboxylesterase isoenzymes in each plant, with major qualitative differences observed between species. The presence of serine hydrolases among the resolved isoenzymes was confirmed through their selective inhibition by the organophosphate insecticide paraoxon. Our studies identify potentially exploitable differences between crops and weeds in their ability to bioactivate herbicides by enzymic hydrolysis and also highlight the usefulness of Arabidopsis as a plant model to study xenobiotic biotransformation.
17379698	Increased Rubisco content in transgenic rice transformed with the 'sense' rbcS gene.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants with substantially increased Rubisco content were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the rice rbcS sense gene under the control of the rice rbcS promoter. The primary transformants were screened for the ratio of Rubisco to leaf-N content, and the transformants with >120% wild-type levels of Rubisco were selected. In the progeny of the selected lines of the transformants, the mRNA levels of one member of the rbcS gene family were increased from 3.9- to 6.2-fold, whereas those of other members of the rbcS gene family were unchanged. The total levels of rbcS mRNA were increased from 2.1- to 2.8-fold. The levels of rbcL mRNA were increased from 1.2- to 1.9-fold. Rubisco protein content was significantly increased by 30% on a leaf area basis. The ratio of Rubisco-N to leaf-N was also increased by 10-20%, irrespective of N treatment. The specific activity of Rubisco per unit of enzyme protein was not different. However, light-saturated photosynthesis was not enhanced even when the rate was measured at low [CO2] where Rubisco becomes limiting for photosynthesis. Some lines showed lower photosynthesis at high [CO2] (>60 Pa). We conclude that introduction of additional sense rbcS leads to overexpression of rbcS and that this overexpression slightly up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL at the transcript level and enhances the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme. However, overproduction of Rubisco protein does not improve photosynthesis.
17412736	Identification of the gravitropism-related rice gene LAZY1 and elucidation of LAZY1-dependent and -independent gravity signaling pathways.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	We identified the gene responsible for three allelic lazy1 mutations of Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning, complementation and RNA interference. Sequence analysis and database searches indicated that the wild-type gene (LAZY1) encodes a novel and unique protein (LAZY1) and that rice has no homologous gene. Two lazy1 mutants were LAZY1 null. Confirming and advancing the previously reported results on lazy1 mutants, we found the following. (i) Gravitropism is impaired, but only partially, in lazy1 coleoptiles. (ii) Circumnutation, observed in dark-grown coleoptiles, is totally absent from lazy1 coleoptiles. (iii) Primary roots of lazy1 mutants show normal gravitropism and circumnutation. (iv) LAZY1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in gravity-sensitive shoot tissues (i.e. coleoptiles, leaf sheath pulvini and lamina joints) and is little expressed in roots. (v) The gravitropic response of lazy1 coleoptiles is kinetically separable from that absent from lazy1 coleoptiles. (vi) Gravity-induced lateral translocation of auxin, found in wild-type coleoptiles, does not occur in lazy1 coleoptiles. Based on the genetic and physiological evidence obtained, it is concluded that LAZY1 is specifically involved in shoot gravitropism and that LAZY1-dependent and -independent signaling pathways occur in coleoptiles. It is further concluded that, in coleoptiles, only the LAZY1-dependent gravity signaling involves asymmetric distribution of auxin between the two lateral halves and is required for circumnutation.
16990289	Identification of active transposon dTok, a member of the hAT family, in rice.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Recent completion of the sequencing of the rice genome has revealed that it contains >40% repetitive sequences, most of which are related to inactive transposable elements. During the molecular analysis of the floral organ number 1/multiple pistil 2 (fon1/mp2) mutant, we identified an active transposable element dTok0 that was inserted at the kinase domain of FON1, a homolog of CLAVATA1. Insertion of the element into FON1 generated an 8 bp duplication of its target sites, which is one of the major characteristics of the hAT family of transposons. The dTok0 element was actively transposed out of the FON1 gene, leaving 5-8 bp footprints. Reinsertion into a new location was observed at a low frequency. Analysis of the genome sequence showed that the rice cultivar 'Nipponbare' contains 25 copies of dTok elements; similar numbers were present in all the Oryza species examined. Because dTok0 does not encode a transposase, enzyme activity should be provided in trans. We identified a putative autonomous transposon, Tok1 that contains an intact open reading frame of the Ac-like transposase.
16339852	The serine/arginine-rich protein family in rice plays important roles in constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA.	2006	Plant Cell	Ser/Arg-rich (SR) proteins play important roles in the constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. We isolated 20 rice (Oryza sativa) genes encoding SR proteins, of which six contain plant-specific characteristics. To determine whether SR proteins modulate splicing efficiency and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in rice, we used transient assays in rice protoplasts by cotransformation of SR protein genes with the rice Waxy(b) (Wx(b))-beta-glucuronidase fusion gene. The results showed that plant-specific RSp29 and RSZp23, an SR protein homologous to human 9G8, enhanced splicing and altered the alternative 5' splice sites of Wx(b) intron 1. The resulting splicing pattern was unique to each SR protein; RSp29 stimulated splicing at the distal site, and RSZp23 enhanced splicing at the proximal site. Results of domain-swapping experiments between plant-specific RSp29 and SCL26, which is a homolog of human SC35, showed the importance of RNA recognition motif 1 and the Arg/Ser-rich (RS) domain for the enhancement of splicing efficiencies. Overexpression of plant-specific RSZ36 and SRp33b, a homolog of human ASF/SF2, in transgenic rice changed the alternative splicing patterns of their own pre-mRNAs and those of other SR proteins. These results show that SR proteins play important roles in constitutive and alternative splicing of rice pre-mRNA.

16399802	ramosa2 encodes a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY domain protein that determines the fate of stem cells in branch meristems of maize.	2006	Plant Cell	Genetic control of grass inflorescence architecture is critical given that cereal seeds provide most of the world's food. Seeds are borne on axillary branches, which arise from groups of stem cells in axils of leaves and whose branching patterns dictate most of the variation in plant form. Normal maize (Zea mays) ears are unbranched, and tassels have long branches only at their base. The ramosa2 (ra2) mutant of maize has increased branching with short branches replaced by long, indeterminate ones. ra2 was cloned by chromosome walking and shown to encode a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY domain transcription factor. ra2 is transiently expressed in a group of cells that predicts the position of axillary meristem formation in inflorescences. Expression in different mutant backgrounds places ra2 upstream of other genes that regulate branch formation. The early expression of ra2 suggests that it functions in the patterning of stem cells in axillary meristems. Alignment of ra2-like sequences reveals a grass-specific domain in the C terminus that is not found in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ra2-dm allele suggests this domain is required for transcriptional activation of ra1. The ra2 expression pattern is conserved in rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize, suggesting that ra2 is critical for shaping the initial steps of grass inflorescence architecture.
16829590	High rate of chimeric gene origination by retroposition in plant genomes.	2006	Plant Cell	Retroposition is widely found to play essential roles in origination of new mammalian and other animal genes. However, the scarcity of retrogenes in plants has led to the assumption that plant genomes rarely evolve new gene duplicates by retroposition, despite abundant retrotransposons in plants and a reported long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon-mediated mechanism of retroposing cellular genes in maize (Zea mays). We show extensive retropositions in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome, with 1235 identified primary retrogenes. We identified 27 of these primary retrogenes within LTR retrotransposons, confirming a previously observed role of retroelements in generating plant retrogenes. Substitution analyses revealed that the vast majority are subject to negative selection, suggesting, along with expression data and evidence of age, that they are likely functional retrogenes. In addition, 42% of these retrosequences have recruited new exons from flanking regions, generating a large number of chimerical genes. We also identified young chimerical genes, suggesting that gene origination through retroposition is ongoing, with a rate an order of magnitude higher than the rate in primates. Finally, we observed that retropositions have followed an unexpected spatial pattern in which functional retrogenes avoid centromeric regions, while retropseudogenes are randomly distributed. These observations suggest that retroposition is an important mechanism that governs gene evolution in rice and other grass species.
16877494	Genomic and genetic characterization of rice Cen3 reveals extensive transcription and evolutionary implications of a complex centromere.	2006	Plant Cell	The centromere is the chromosomal site for assembly of the kinetochore where spindle fibers attach during cell division. In most multicellular eukaryotes, centromeres are composed of long tracts of satellite repeats that are recalcitrant to sequencing and fine-scale genetic mapping. Here, we report the genomic and genetic characterization of the complete centromere of rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 3. Using a DNA fiber-fluorescence in situ hybridization approach, we demonstrated that the centromere of chromosome 3 (Cen3) contains approximately 441 kb of the centromeric satellite repeat CentO. Cen3 includes an approximately 1,881-kb domain associated with the centromeric histone CENH3. This CENH3-associated chromatin domain is embedded within a 3,113-kb region that lacks genetic recombination. Extensive transcription was detected within the CENH3 binding domain based on comprehensive annotation of protein-coding genes coupled with empirical measurements of mRNA levels using RT-PCR and massively parallel signature sequencing. Genes <10 kb from the CentO satellite array were expressed in several rice tissues and displayed histone modification patterns consistent with euchromatin, suggesting that rice centromeric chromatin accommodates normal gene expression. These results support the hypothesis that centromeres can evolve from gene-containing genomic regions.
16935986	Discovery of cyclotide-like protein sequences in graminaceous crop plants: ancestral precursors of circular proteins?	2006	Plant Cell	Cyclotides are peptides from plants of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families that have the unusual characteristic of a macrocylic backbone. They are further characterized by their incorporation of a cystine knot in which two disulfides, along with the intervening backbone residues, form a ring through which a third disulfide is threaded. The cyclotides have been found in every Violaceae species screened to date but are apparently present in only a few Rubiaceae species. The selective distribution reported so far raises questions about the evolution of the cyclotides within the plant kingdom. In this study, we use a combined bioinformatics and expression analysis approach to elucidate the evolution and distribution of the cyclotides in the plant kingdom and report the discovery of related sequences widespread in the Poaceae family, including crop plants such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), which carry considerable economic and social importance. The presence of cyclotide-like sequences within these plants suggests that the cyclotides may be derived from an ancestral gene of great antiquity. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to show that two of the discovered cyclotide-like genes from rice and barley (Hordeum vulgare) have tissue-specific expression patterns.
16905658	Interaction between rice MYBGA and the gibberellin response element controls tissue-specific sugar sensitivity of alpha-amylase genes.	2006	Plant Cell	Expression of alpha-amylase genes during cereal grain germination and seedling growth is regulated negatively by sugar in embryos and positively by gibberellin (GA) in endosperm through the sugar response complex (SRC) and the GA response complex (GARC), respectively. We analyzed two alpha-amylase promoters, alphaAmy3 containing only SRC and alphaAmy8 containing overlapped SRC and GARC. alphaAmy3 was sugar-sensitive but GA-nonresponsive in both rice (Oryza sativa) embryos and endosperms, whereas alphaAmy8 was sugar-sensitive in embryos and GA-responsive in endosperms. Mutation of the GA response element (GARE) in the alphaAmy8 promoter impaired its GA response but enhanced sugar sensitivity, and insertion of GARE in the alphaAmy3 promoter rendered it GA-responsive but sugar-insensitive in endosperms. Expression of the GARE-interacting transcription factor MYBGA was induced by GA in endosperms, correlating with the endosperm-specific alphaAmy8 GA response. alphaAmy8 became sugar-sensitive in MYBGA knockout mutant endosperms, suggesting that the MYBGA-GARE interaction overrides the sugar sensitivity of alphaAmy8. In embryos overexpressing MYBGA, alphaAmy8 became sugar-insensitive, indicating that MYBGA affects sugar repression. alpha-Amylase promoters active in endosperms contain GARE, whereas those active in embryos may or may not contain GARE, confirming that the GARE and GA-induced MYBGA interaction prevents sugar feedback repression of endosperm alpha-amylase genes. We demonstrate that the MYBGA-GARE interaction affects sugar feedback control in balanced energy production during seedling growth and provide insight into the control mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of alpha-amylase expression by sugar and GA signaling interference.
17041148	A rice Tc1/mariner-like element transposes in yeast.	2006	Plant Cell	The Tc1/mariner transposable element superfamily is widely distributed in animal and plant genomes. However, no active plant element has been previously identified. Nearly identical copies of a rice (Oryza sativa) Tc1/mariner element called Osmar5 in the genome suggested potential activity. Previous studies revealed that Osmar5 encoded a protein that bound specifically to its own ends. In this report, we show that Osmar5 is an active transposable element by demonstrating that expression of its coding sequence in yeast promotes the excision of a nonautonomous Osmar5 element located in a reporter construct. Element excision produces transposon footprints, whereas element reinsertion occurs at TA dinucleotides that were either tightly linked or unlinked to the excision site. Several site-directed mutations in the transposase abolished activity, whereas mutations in the transposase binding site prevented transposition of the nonautonomous element from the reporter construct. This report of an active plant Tc1/mariner in yeast will provide a foundation for future comparative analyses of animal and plant elements in addition to making a new wide host range transposable element available for plant gene tagging.
17056708	Multiple upstream signals converge on the adaptor protein Mst50 in Magnaporthe grisea.	2006	Plant Cell	Rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) forms a highly specialized infection structure for plant penetration, the appressorium, the formation and growth of which are regulated by the Mst11-Mst7-Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. We characterized the MST50 gene that directly interacts with both MST11 and MST7. Similar to the mst11 mutant, the mst50 mutant was defective in appressorium formation, sensitive to osmotic stresses, and nonpathogenic. Expressing a dominant active MST7 allele in mst50 complemented its defects in appressorium but not lesion formation. The sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain of Mst50 was essential for its interaction with Mst11 and for appressorium formation. Although the SAM and Ras-association domain (RAD) of Mst50 were dispensable for its interaction with Mst7, deletion of RAD reduced appressorium formation and virulence on rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. The interaction between Mst50 and Mst7 or Mst11 was detected by coimmunoprecipitation assays in developing appressoria. Mst50 also interacts with Ras1, Ras2, Cdc42, and Mgb1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Expressing a dominant active RAS2 allele in the wild-type strain but not in mst50 stimulated abnormal appressorium formation. These results indicate that MST50 functions as an adaptor protein interacting with multiple upstream components and plays critical roles in activating the Pmk1 cascade for appressorium formation and plant infection in M. grisea.
17056706	NPS6, encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase involved in siderophore-mediated iron metabolism, is a conserved virulence determinant of plant pathogenic ascomycetes.	2006	Plant Cell	NPS6, encoding a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, is a virulence determinant in the maize (Zea mays) pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus and is involved in tolerance to H(2)O(2). Deletion of NPS6 orthologs in the rice (Oryza sativa) pathogen, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, and the Arabidopsis thaliana pathogen, Alternaria brassicicola, resulted in reduced virulence and hypersensitivity to H(2)O(2). Introduction of the NPS6 ortholog from the saprobe Neurospora crassa to the Deltanps6 strain of C. heterostrophus restored wild-type virulence to maize and tolerance to H(2)O(2), demonstrating functional conservation in filamentous ascomycete phytopathogens and saprobes. Increased sensitivity to iron depletion was identified as a conserved phenotype of Deltanps6 strains. Exogenous application of iron enhanced the virulence of Deltanps6 strains of C. heterostrophus, C. miyabeanus, F. graminearum, and A. brassicicola to each host. NPS6 is responsible for the biosynthesis of extracellular siderophores by C. heterostrophus, F. graminearum, and A. brassicicola. Application of the extracellular siderophore of A. brassicicola restored wild-type virulence of the DeltaAbnps6 strain to Arabidopsis. It is proposed that the role of extracellular siderophores in fungal virulence to plants is to supply an essential nutrient, iron, to their producers in planta and not to act as phytotoxins, depriving their hosts of iron.
17098810	Functional conservation of a root hair cell-specific cis-element in angiosperms with different root hair distribution patterns.	2006	Plant Cell	Vascular plants develop distinctive root hair distribution patterns in the root epidermis, depending on the taxon. The three patterns, random (Type 1), asymmetrical cell division (Type 2), and positionally cued (Type 3), are controlled by different upstream fate-determining factors that mediate expression of root hair cell-specific genes for hair morphogenesis. Here, we address whether these root hair genes possess a common transcriptional regulatory module (cis-element) determining cell-type specificity despite differences in the final root hair pattern. We identified Arabidopsis thaliana expansinA7 (At EXPA7) orthologous (and paralogous) genes from diverse angiosperm species with different hair distribution patterns. The promoters of these genes contain conserved root hair-specific cis-elements (RHEs) that were functionally verified in the Type-3 Arabidopsis root. The promoter of At EXPA7 (Type-3 pattern) also showed hair cell-specific expression in the Type 2 rice (Oryza sativa) root. Root hair-specific genes other than EXPAs also carry functionally homologous RHEs in their promoters. The RHE core consensus was established by a multiple alignment of functionally characterized RHEs from different species and by high-resolution analysis of At EXPA7 RHE1. Our results suggest that this regulatory module of root hair-specific genes has been conserved across angiosperms despite the divergence of upstream fate-determining machinery.
17138695	The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development.	2006	Plant Cell	In flowering plants, tapetum degeneration is proposed to be triggered by a programmed cell death (PCD) process during late stages of pollen development; the PCD is thought to provide cellular contents supporting pollen wall formation and to allow the subsequent pollen release. However, the molecular basis regulating tapetum PCD in plants remains poorly understood. We report the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male sterile mutant tapetum degeneration retardation (tdr), which exhibits degeneration retardation of the tapetum and middle layer as well as collapse of microspores. The TDR gene is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix protein, which is likely localized to the nucleus. More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results indicate that TDR is a key component of the molecular network regulating rice tapetum development and degeneration.
17138699	Wax-deficient anther1 is involved in cuticle and wax production in rice anther walls and is required for pollen development.	2006	Plant Cell	In vegetative leaf tissues, cuticles including cuticular waxes are important for protection against nonstomatal water loss and pathogen infection as well as for adaptations to environmental stress. However, their roles in the anther wall are rarely studied. The innermost layer of the anther wall (the tapetum) is essential for generating male gametes. Here, we report the characterization of a T-DNA insertional mutant in the Wax-deficient anther1 (Wda1) gene of rice (Oryza sativa), which shows significant defects in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids in both layers. This gene is strongly expressed in the epidermal cells of anthers. Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that epicuticular wax crystals were absent in the outer layer of the anther and that microspore development was severely retarded and finally disrupted as a result of defective pollen exine formation in the mutant anthers. These biochemical and developmental defects in tapetum found in wda1 mutants are earlier events than those in other male-sterile mutants, which showed defects of lipidic molecules in exine. Our findings provide new insights into the biochemical and developmental aspects of the role of waxes in microspore exine development in the tapetum as well as the role of epicuticular waxes in anther expansion.
17114350	Arabidopsis SLIM1 is a central transcriptional regulator of plant sulfur response and metabolism.	2006	Plant Cell	Sulfur is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth. To identify key transcription factors regulating the sulfur assimilatory pathway, we screened Arabidopsis thaliana mutants using a fluorescent reporter gene construct consisting of the sulfur limitation-responsive promoter of the SULTR1;2 sulfate transporter and green fluorescent protein as a background indicator for monitoring plant sulfur responses. The isolated mutant, sulfur limitation1 (slim1), was unable to induce SULTR1;2 transcripts under low-sulfur (-S) conditions. Mutations causing the sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes of slim1 were identified in an EIL family transcription factor, ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE3 (EIL3), whose functional identity with SLIM1 was confirmed by genetic complementation. Sulfate uptake and plant growth on -S were significantly reduced by slim1 mutations but recovered by overexpression of SLIM1. SLIM1 functioned as a central transcriptional regulator, which controlled both the activation of sulfate acquisition and degradation of glucosinolates under -S conditions. Metabolite analysis indicated stable accumulation of glucosinolates in slim1 mutants, even under -S conditions, particularly in the molecular species with methylsulfinylalkyl side chains beneficial to human health. Overexpression of SLIM1 and its rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, but no other EIL genes of Arabidopsis, restored the sulfur limitation responseless phenotypes of slim1 mutants, suggesting uniqueness of the SLIM1/EIL3 subgroup members as sulfur response regulators.
17209124	Rice SCAMP1 defines clathrin-coated, trans-golgi-located tubular-vesicular structures as an early endosome in tobacco BY-2 cells.	2007	Plant Cell	We recently identified multivesicular bodies (MVBs) as prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) in the secretory and endocytic pathways to the lytic vacuole in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells. Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are post-Golgi, integral membrane proteins mediating endocytosis in animal cells. To define the endocytic pathway in plants, we cloned the rice (Oryza sativa) homolog of animal SCAMP1 and generated transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-SCAMP1 or SCAMP1-YFP fusions. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy studies demonstrated that YFP-SCAMP1 fusions and native SCAMP1 localize to the plasma membrane and mobile structures in the cytoplasm of transgenic BY-2 cells. Drug treatments and confocal immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the punctate cytosolic organelles labeled by YFP-SCAMP1 or SCAMP1 were distinct from the Golgi apparatus and PVCs. SCAMP1-labeled organelles may represent an early endosome because the internalized endocytic markers FM4-64 and AM4-64 reached these organelles before PVCs. In addition, wortmannin caused the redistribution of SCAMP1 from the early endosomes to PVCs, probably as a result of fusions between the two compartments. Immunogold electron microscopy with high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples identified the SCAMP1-positive organelles as tubular-vesicular structures at the trans-Golgi with clathrin coats. These early endosomal compartments resemble the previously described partially coated reticulum and trans-Golgi network in plant cells.
17586655	Genetic and epigenetic alteration among three homoeologous genes of a class E MADS box gene in hexaploid wheat.	2007	Plant Cell	Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a hexaploid species with A, B, and D ancestral genomes. Most bread wheat genes are present in the genome as triplicated homoeologous genes (homoeologs) derived from the ancestral species. Here, we report that both genetic and epigenetic alterations have occurred in the homoeologs of a wheat class E MADS box gene. Two class E genes are identified in wheat, wheat SEPALLATA (WSEP) and wheat LEAFY HULL STERILE1 (WLHS1), which are homologs of Os MADS45 and Os MADS1 in rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. The three wheat homoeologs of WSEP showed similar genomic structures and expression profiles. By contrast, the three homoeologs of WLHS1 showed genetic and epigenetic alterations. The A genome WLHS1 homoeolog (WLHS1-A) had a structural alteration that contained a large novel sequence in place of the K domain sequence. A yeast two-hybrid analysis and a transgenic experiment indicated that the WLHS1-A protein had no apparent function. The B and D genome homoeologs, WLHS1-B and WLHS1-D, respectively, had an intact MADS box gene structure, but WLHS1-B was predominantly silenced by cytosine methylation. Consequently, of the three WLHS1 homoeologs, only WLHS1-D functions in hexaploid wheat. This is a situation where three homoeologs are differentially regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
17586654	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	Although several potential telomere binding proteins have been identified in higher plants, their in vivo functions are still unknown at the plant level. Both knockout and antisense mutants of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN1 (RTBP1) exhibited markedly longer telomeres relative to those of the wild type, indicating that the amount of functional RTBP1 is inversely correlated with telomere length. rtbp1 plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4). Reproductive organ formation, including panicles, stamens, and spikelets, was also gradually and severely impaired in G1 to G4 mutants. Up to 11.4, 17.2, and 26.7% of anaphases in G2, G3, and G4 mutant pollen mother cells, respectively, exhibited one or more chromosomal fusions, and this progressively increasing aberrant morphology was correlated with an increased frequency of anaphase bridges containing telomeric repeat DNA. Furthermore, 35S:anti-RTBP1 plants expressing lower levels of RTBP1 mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly. These results suggest that RTBP1 plays dual roles in rice (Oryza sativa), as both a negative regulator of telomere length and one of positive and functional components for proper architecture of telomeres.
17586658	ACTIN BINDING PROTEIN 29 from Lilium pollen plays an important role in dynamic actin remodeling.	2007	Plant Cell	Villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily proteins have been shown to function in tip-growing plant cells. However, genes encoding gelsolin/fragmin do not exist in the Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) databases, and it is possible that these proteins are encoded by villin mRNA splicing variants. We cloned a 1006-bp full-length cDNA from Lilium longiflorum that encodes a 263-amino acid predicted protein sharing 100% identity with the N terminus of 135-ABP (Lilium villin) except for six C-terminal amino acids. The deduced 29-kD protein, Lilium ACTIN BINDING PROTEIN29 (ABP29), contains only the G1 and G2 domains and is the smallest identified member of the villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily. The purified recombinant ABP29 accelerates actin nucleation, blocks barbed ends, and severs actin filaments in a Ca(2+)- and/or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-regulated manner in vitro. Microinjection of the protein into stamen hair cells disrupted transvacuolar strands whose backbone is mainly actin filament bundles. Transient expression of ABP29 by microprojectile bombardment of lily pollen resulted in actin filament fragmentation and inhibited pollen germination and tube growth. Our results suggest that ABP29 is a splicing variant of Lilium villin and a member of the villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily, which plays important roles in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton during pollen germination and tube growth.
17601827	Rice WRKY45 plays a crucial role in benzothiadiazole-inducible blast resistance.	2007	Plant Cell	Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a so-called plant activator and protects plants from diseases by activating the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. By microarray screening, we identified BTH- and SA-inducible WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes that were upregulated within 3 h after BTH treatment. Overexpression of one of them, WRKY45, in rice (Oryza sativa) markedly enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of WRKY45 compromised BTH-inducible resistance to blast disease, indicating that it is essential for BTH-induced defense responses. In a transient expression system, WRKY45 activated reporter gene transcription through W-boxes. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY45 acts in the SA signaling pathway independently of NH1, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1, which distinguishes WRKY45 from known Arabidopsis WRKY TFs. Two defense-related genes, encoding a glutathione S-transferase and a cytochrome P450, were found to be regulated downstream of WRKY45 but were not regulated by NH1, consistent with the apparent independence of the WRKY45- and NH1-dependent pathways. Defense gene expression in WRKY45-overexpressed rice plants varied with growth conditions, suggesting that some environmental factor(s) acts downstream of WRKY45 transcription. We propose a role for WRKY45 in BTH-induced and SA-mediated defense signaling in rice and its potential utility in improving disease resistance of rice, an importance food resource worldwide.
17720868	Large-scale, lineage-specific expansion of a bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad complex ubiquitin-ligase gene family in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	Selective ubiquitination of proteins is directed by diverse families of ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s) in plants. One important type uses Cullin-3 as a scaffold to assemble multisubunit E3 complexes containing one of a multitude of bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad complex (BTB) proteins that function as substrate recognition factors. We previously described the 80-member BTB gene superfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we describe the complete BTB superfamily in rice (Oryza sativa spp japonica cv Nipponbare) that contains 149 BTB domain-encoding genes and 43 putative pseudogenes. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the rice and Arabidopsis superfamilies revealed a near equal repertoire of putative substrate recognition module types. However, phylogenetic comparisons detected numerous gene duplication and/or loss events since the rice and Arabidopsis BTB lineages split, suggesting possible functional specialization within individual BTB families. In particular, a major expansion and diversification of a subset of BTB proteins containing Meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) substrate recognition sites was evident in rice and other monocots that likely occurred following the monocot/dicot split. The MATH domain of a subset appears to have evolved significantly faster than those in a smaller core subset that predates flowering plants, suggesting that the substrate recognition module in many monocot MATH-BTB E3s are diversifying to ubiquitinate a set of substrates that are themselves rapidly changing. Intriguing possibilities include pathogen proteins attempting to avoid inactivation by the monocot host.
17766403	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice.	2007	Plant Cell	Sugars repress alpha-amylase expression in germinating embryos and cell cultures of rice (Oryza sativa) through a sugar response complex (SRC) in alpha-amylase gene promoters and its interacting transcription factor MYBS1. The Snf1 protein kinase is required for the derepression of glucose-repressible genes in yeast. In this study, we explored the role of the yeast Snf1 ortholog in rice, SnRK1, in sugar signaling and plant growth. Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC promoters. Both SnRK1s contain N-terminal kinase domains serving as activators and C-terminal regulatory domains as dominant negative regulators of SRC. The accumulation and activity of SnRK1A was regulated by sugars posttranscriptionally, and SnRK1A relieved glucose repression specifically through the TA box in SRC. A transgenic RNA interference approach indicated that SnRK1A is also necessary for the activation of MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 expression under glucose starvation. Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied. Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice.
17704215	Magnaporthe grisea cutinase2 mediates appressorium differentiation and host penetration and is required for full virulence.	2007	Plant Cell	The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea infects its host by forming a specialized infection structure, the appressorium, on the plant leaf. The enormous turgor pressure generated within the appressorium drives the emerging penetration peg forcefully through the plant cuticle. Hitherto, the involvement of cutinase(s) in this process has remained unproven. We identified a specific M. grisea cutinase, CUT2, whose expression is dramatically upregulated during appressorium maturation and penetration. The cut2 mutant has reduced extracellular cutin-degrading and Ser esterase activity, when grown on cutin as the sole carbon source, compared with the wild-type strain. The cut2 mutant strain is severely less pathogenic than the wild type or complemented cut2/CUT2 strain on rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). It displays reduced conidiation and anomalous germling morphology, forming multiple elongated germ tubes and aberrant appressoria on inductive surfaces. We show that Cut2 mediates the formation of the penetration peg but does not play a role in spore or appressorium adhesion, or in appressorial turgor generation. Morphological and pathogenicity defects in the cut2 mutant are fully restored with exogenous application of synthetic cutin monomers, cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and diacylglycerol (DAG). We propose that Cut2 is an upstream activator of cAMP/protein kinase A and DAG/protein kinase C signaling pathways that direct appressorium formation and infectious growth in M. grisea. Cut2 is therefore required for surface sensing leading to correct germling differentiation, penetration, and full virulence in this model fungus.
17890377	Rice Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses.	2007	Plant Cell	Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Pto encodes a protein kinase that confers resistance to bacterial speck disease. A second protein kinase, Pti1, physically interacts with Pto and is involved in Pto-mediated defense signaling. Pti1-related sequences are highly conserved among diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), but their functions are largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a null mutant for the Pti1 homolog in rice and the functional characterization of Os Pti1a. The rice pti1a mutant was characterized by spontaneous necrotic lesions on leaves, which was accompanied by a series of defense responses and resistance against a compatible race of Magnaporthe grisea. Overexpression of Pti1a in rice reduced resistance against an incompatible race of the fungus recognized by a resistance (R) protein, Pish. Plants overexpressing Pti1a were also more susceptible to a compatible race of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. These results suggest that Os Pti1a negatively regulates defense signaling for both R gene-mediated and basal resistance. We also demonstrated that repression of the rice RAR1 gene suppressed defense responses induced in the pti1a mutant, indicating that Pti1a negatively regulates RAR1-dependent defense responses. Expression of a tomato Pti1 cDNA in the rice pti1a mutant suppressed the mutant phenotypes. This contrasts strikingly with the previous finding that Sl Pti1 enhances Pto-mediated hypersensitive response (HR) induction when expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), suggesting that the molecular switch controlling HR downstream of pathogen recognition has evolved differently in rice and tomato.
17965272	A circadian rhythm set by dusk determines the expression of FT homologs and the short-day photoperiodic flowering response in Pharbitis.	2007	Plant Cell	Seasonal control of flowering through responsiveness to daylength shows extreme variation. Different species flower in response to long days or short days (SDs), and this difference evolved several times. The molecular mechanisms conferring these responses have been compared in detail only in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) and suggest that a conserved pathway confers daylength responses through regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcription by CONSTANS (CO). We studied Pharbitis (Ipomoea nil; formerly, Pharbitis nil), a widely used SD model species and a member of the Convolvulaceae, and showed using transgenic plants together with detailed expression analysis that two putative orthologs of FT (Pn FT1 and Pn FT2) promote flowering specifically under SDs. These genes are expressed only under SDs, and light flashes given during the night reduce their expression and prevent flowering. We demonstrate that in Pharbitis a circadian rhythm set by the light-to-dark transition at dusk regulates Pn FT expression, which rises only when the night is longer than 11 h. Furthermore, Pharbitis accessions that differ in their critical night-length responses express Pn FT at different times after dusk, demonstrating that natural genetic variation influencing the clock regulating Pn FT expression alters the flowering response. In these assays, Pn FT mRNA abundance was not related to Pn CO expression, suggesting that Pn FT may be regulated by a different transcription factor in Pharbitis. We conclude that SD response in Pharbitis is controlled by a dedicated light sensitive clock, set by dusk, that activates Pn FT transcription in darkness, a different mechanism for measuring daylength than described for Arabidopsis and rice.
17965273	The GID1-mediated gibberellin perception mechanism is conserved in the Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii but not in the Bryophyte Physcomitrella patens.	2007	Plant Cell	In rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, gibberellin (GA) signaling is mediated by GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and DELLA proteins in collaboration with a GA-specific F-box protein. To explore when plants evolved the ability to perceive GA by the GID1/DELLA pathway, we examined these GA signaling components in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii and the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. An in silico search identified several homologs of GID1, DELLA, and GID2, a GA-specific F-box protein in rice, in both species. Sm GID1a and Sm GID1b, GID1 proteins from S. moellendorffii, showed GA binding activity in vitro and interacted with DELLA proteins from S. moellendorffii in a GA-dependent manner in yeast. Introduction of constitutively expressed Sm GID1a, Sm G1D1b, and Sm GID2a transgenes rescued the dwarf phenotype of rice gid1 and gid2 mutants. Furthermore, treatment with GA(4), a major GA in S. moellendorffii, caused downregulation of Sm GID1b, Sm GA20 oxidase, and Sm GA3 oxidase and degradation of the Sm DELLA1 protein. These results demonstrate that the homologs of GID1, DELLA, and GID2 work in a similar manner in S. moellendorffii and in flowering plants. Biochemical studies revealed that Sm GID1s have different GA binding properties from GID1s in flowering plants. No evidence was found for the functional conservation of these genes in P. patens, indicating that GID1/DELLA-mediated GA signaling, if present, differs from that in vascular plants. Our results suggest that GID1/DELLA-mediated GA signaling appeared after the divergence of vascular plants from the moss lineage.
18083909	Gibberellin regulates pollen viability and pollen tube growth in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	Gibberellins (GAs) play many biological roles in higher plants. We collected and performed genetic analysis on rice (Oryza sativa) GA-related mutants, including GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants. Genetic analysis of the mutants revealed that rice GA-deficient mutations are not transmitted as Mendelian traits to the next generation following self-pollination of F1 heterozygous plants, although GA-insensitive mutations are transmitted normally. To understand these differences in transmission, we examined the effect of GA on microsporogenesis and pollen tube elongation in rice using new GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants that produce semifertile flowers. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the GA-deficient mutant reduced pollen elongation1 is defective in pollen tube elongation, resulting in a low fertilization frequency, whereas the GA-insensitive semidominant mutant Slr1-d3 is mainly defective in viable pollen production. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that GA biosynthesis genes tested whose mutations are transmitted to the next generation at a lower frequency are preferentially expressed after meiosis during pollen development, but expression is absent or very low before the meiosis stage, whereas GA signal-related genes are actively expressed before meiosis. Based on these observations, we predict that the transmission of GA-signaling genes occurs in a sporophytic manner, since the protein products and/or mRNA transcripts of these genes may be introduced into pollen-carrying mutant alleles, whereas GA synthesis genes are transmitted in a gametophytic manner, since these genes are preferentially expressed after meiosis.
18156215	Regulation of rice NADPH oxidase by binding of Rac GTPase to its N-terminal extension.	2007	Plant Cell	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidase play critical roles in various cellular activities, including plant innate immunity response. In contrast with the large multiprotein NADPH oxidase complex of phagocytes, in plants, only the homologs of the catalytic subunit gp91phox and the cytosolic regulator small GTPase Rac are found. Plant homologs of the gp91phox subunit are known as Rboh (for respiratory burst oxidase homolog). Although numerous Rboh have been isolated in plants, the regulation of enzymatic activity remains unknown. All rboh genes identified to date possess a conserved N-terminal extension that contains two Ca2+ binding EF-hand motifs. Previously, we ascertained that a small GTPase Rac (Os Rac1) enhanced pathogen-associated molecular pattern-induced ROS production and resistance to pathogens in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, using yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that interaction between Rac GTPases and the N-terminal extension is ubiquitous and that a substantial part of the N-terminal region of Rboh, including the two EF-hand motifs, is required for the interaction. The direct Rac-Rboh interaction was supported by further studies using in vitro pull-down assay, a nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiment, and in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. The FRET analysis also suggests that cytosolic Ca2+ concentration may regulate Rac-Rboh interaction in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, transient coexpression of Os Rac1 and rbohB enhanced ROS production in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting that direct Rac-Rboh interaction may activate NADPH oxidase activity in plants. Taken together, the results suggest that cytosolic Ca2+ concentration may modulate NADPH oxidase activity by regulating the interaction between Rac GTPase and Rboh.
18156216	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	A rice (Oryza sativa) Rac/Rop GTPase, Os Rac1, is involved in innate immunity, but its molecular function is largely unknown. RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species. HSP90 has also recently been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. However, their functions at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90. Os RAR1-RNA interference (RNAi) rice plants had impaired basal resistance to a compatible race of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the virulent bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo. Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures. Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex. Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice.
17918309	GA perception and signal transduction: molecular interactions of the GA receptor GID1 with GA and the DELLA protein SLR1 in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	
18223036	Characterization of Arabidopsis and rice DWD proteins and their roles as substrate receptors for CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.	2008	Plant Cell	A subset of WD40 proteins that contain a DWD motif (for DDB1 binding WD40) is reported to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (for Damaged DNA Binding 1-Cullin 4-Regulator of Cullins 1) based E3 ubiquitin ligases in humans. Here, we report 85 Arabidopsis thaliana and 78 rice (Oryza sativa) proteins containing the conserved 16-amino acid DWD motif. We show by yeast two-hybrid and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation that 11 Arabidopsis DWD proteins directly interact with DDB1 and thus may serve as substrate receptors for the DDB1-CUL4 machinery. We further examine whether the DWD protein PRL1 (for Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1) may act as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase. PRL1 directly interacts with DDB1, and prl1 and cul4cs mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, including altered responses to a variety of stimuli. Moreover, AKIN10 (for Arabidopsis SNF1 Kinase Homolog 10) was degraded more slowly in cell extracts of prl1 and cul4cs than in cell extracts of the wild type. Thus, both genetic and biochemical analyses support the conclusion that PRL1 is the substrate receptor of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10. This work adds a large new family to the current portfolio of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases.
18263775	High-resolution mapping of epigenetic modifications of the rice genome uncovers interplay between DNA methylation, histone methylation, and gene expression.	2008	Plant Cell	We present high-resolution maps of DNA methylation and H3K4 di- and trimethylation of two entire chromosomes and two fully sequenced centromeres in rice (Oryza sativa) shoots and cultured cells. This analysis reveals combinatorial interactions between these epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure and gene expression. Cytologically densely stained heterochromatin had less H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and more methylated DNA than the less densely stained euchromatin, whereas centromeres had a unique epigenetic composition. Most transposable elements had highly methylated DNA but no H3K4 methylation, whereas more than half of protein-coding genes had both methylated DNA and di- and/or trimethylated H3K4. Methylation of DNA but not H3K4 was correlated with suppressed transcription. By contrast, when both DNA and H3K4 were methylated, transcription was only slightly reduced. Transcriptional activity was positively correlated with the ratio of H3K4me3/H3K4me2: genes with predominantly H3K4me3 were actively transcribed, whereas genes with predominantly H3K4me2 were transcribed at moderate levels. More protein-coding genes contained all three modifications, and more transposons contained DNA methylation in shoots than cultured cells. Differential epigenetic modifications correlated to tissue-specific expression between shoots and cultured cells. Collectively, this study provides insights into the rice epigenomes and their effect on gene expression and plant development.
18178768	Identification and characterization of shared duplications between rice and wheat provide new insight into grass genome evolution.	2008	Plant Cell	The grass family comprises the most important cereal crops and is a good system for studying, with comparative genomics, mechanisms of evolution, speciation, and domestication. Here, we identified and characterized the evolution of shared duplications in the rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) genomes by comparing 42,654 rice gene sequences with 6426 mapped wheat ESTs using improved sequence alignment criteria and statistical analysis. Intraspecific comparisons identified 29 interchromosomal duplications covering 72% of the rice genome and 10 duplication blocks covering 67.5% of the wheat genome. Using the same methodology, we assessed orthologous relationships between the two genomes and detected 13 blocks of colinearity that represent 83.1 and 90.4% of the rice and wheat genomes, respectively. Integration of the intraspecific duplications data with colinearity relationships revealed seven duplicated segments conserved at orthologous positions. A detailed analysis of the length, composition, and divergence time of these duplications and comparisons with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays) indicated common and lineage-specific patterns of conservation between the different genomes. This allowed us to propose a model in which the grass genomes have evolved from a common ancestor with a basic number of five chromosomes through a series of whole genome and segmental duplications, chromosome fusions, and translocations.
17220363	Plant Gene and Alternatively Spliced Variant Annotator. A plant genome annotation pipeline for rice gene and alternatively spliced variant identification with cross-species expressed sequence tag conservation from seven plant species.	2007	Plant Physiol	The completion of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome draft has brought unprecedented opportunities for genomic studies of the world's most important food crop. Previous rice gene annotations have relied mainly on ab initio methods, which usually yield a high rate of false-positive predictions and give only limited information regarding alternative splicing in rice genes. Comparative approaches based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs) can compensate for the drawbacks of ab initio methods because they can simultaneously identify experimental data-supported genes and alternatively spliced transcripts. Furthermore, cross-species EST information can be used to not only offset the insufficiency of same-species ESTs but also derive evolutionary implications. In this study, we used ESTs from seven plant species, rice, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), soybean (Glycine max), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), to annotate the rice genome. We developed a plant genome annotation pipeline, Plant Gene and Alternatively Spliced Variant Annotator (PGAA). Using this approach, we identified 852 genes (931 isoforms) not annotated in other widely used databases (i.e. the Institute for Genomic Research, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and Rice Annotation Project) and found 87% of them supported by both rice and nonrice EST evidence. PGAA also identified more than 44,000 alternatively spliced events, of which approximately 20% are not observed in the other three annotations. These novel annotations represent rich opportunities for rice genome research, because the functions of most of our annotated genes are currently unknown. Also, in the PGAA annotation, the isoforms with non-rice-EST-supported exons are significantly enriched in transporter activity but significantly underrepresented in transcription regulator activity. We have also identified potential lineage-specific and conserved isoforms, which are important markers in evolutionary studies. The data and the Web-based interface, RiceViewer, are available for public access at http://RiceViewer.genomics.sinica.edu.tw/.
17172291	The rice kinase database. A phylogenomic database for the rice kinome.	2007	Plant Physiol	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains 1,429 protein kinases, the vast majority of which have unknown functions. We created a phylogenomic database (http://rkd.ucdavis.edu) to facilitate functional analysis of this large gene family. Sequence and genomic data, including gene expression data and protein-protein interaction maps, can be displayed for each selected kinase in the context of a phylogenetic tree allowing for comparative analysis both within and between large kinase subfamilies. Interaction maps are easily accessed through links and displayed using Cytoscape, an open source software platform. Chromosomal distribution of all rice kinases can also be explored via an interactive interface.
17189339	Proteome dynamics during plastid differentiation in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	We have analyzed proteome dynamics during light-induced development of rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplasts from etioplasts using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry protein identification. In the dark, the etioplast allocates the main proportion of total protein mass to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and a surprisingly high number of proteins to the regulation and expression of plastid genes. Chaperones, proteins for photosynthetic energy metabolism, and enzymes of the tetrapyrrole pathway were identified among the most abundant etioplast proteins. The detection of 13 N-terminal acetylated peptides allowed us to map the exact localization of the transit peptide cleavage site, demonstrating good agreement with the prediction for most proteins. Based on the quantitative etioplast proteome map, we examined early light-induced changes during chloroplast development. The transition from heterotrophic metabolism to photosynthesis-supported autotrophic metabolism was already detectable 2 h after illumination and affected most essential metabolic modules. Enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, and gene expression were up-regulated, whereas enzymes in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism were significantly decreased in relative abundance. Enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, and redox regulation remained unchanged. Phosphoprotein-specific staining at different time points during chloroplast development revealed light-induced phosphorylation of a nuclear-encoded plastid RNA-binding protein, consistent with changes in plastid RNA metabolism. Quantitative information about all identified proteins and their regulation by light is available in plprot, the plastid proteome database (http://www.plprot.ethz.ch).
17449648	barren inflorescence2 Encodes a co-ortholog of the PINOID serine/threonine kinase and is required for organogenesis during inflorescence and vegetative development in maize.	2007	Plant Physiol	Organogenesis in plants is controlled by meristems. Axillary meristems, which give rise to branches and flowers, play a critical role in plant architecture and reproduction. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) have additional types of axillary meristems in the inflorescence compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and thus provide an excellent model system to study axillary meristem initiation. Previously, we characterized the barren inflorescence2 (bif2) mutant in maize and showed that bif2 plays a key role in axillary meristem and lateral primordia initiation in the inflorescence. In this article, we cloned bif2 by transposon tagging. Isolation of bif2-like genes from seven other grasses, along with phylogenetic analysis, showed that bif2 is a co-ortholog of PINOID (PID), which regulates auxin transport in Arabidopsis. Expression analysis showed that bif2 is expressed in all axillary meristems and lateral primordia during inflorescence and vegetative development in maize and rice. Further phenotypic analysis of bif2 mutants in maize illustrates additional roles of bif2 during vegetative development. We propose that bif2/PID sequence and expression are conserved between grasses and Arabidopsis, attesting to the important role they play in development. We provide further support that bif2, and by analogy PID, is required for initiation of both axillary meristems and lateral primordia.
17535819	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement.	2007	Plant Physiol	Plants respond to adverse environments by initiating a series of signaling processes that often involves diverse protein kinases, including calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). In this study, putative CIPK genes (OsCIPK01-OsCIPK30) in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were surveyed for their transcriptional responses to various abiotic stresses. The results showed that 20 OsCIPK genes were differentially induced by at least one of the stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, polyethylene glycol, and abscisic acid treatment. Most of the genes induced by drought or salt stress were also induced by abscisic acid treatment but not by cold. A few CIPK genes containing none of the reported stress-responsive cis-elements in their promoter regions were also induced by multiple stresses. To prove that some of these stress-responsive OsCIPK genes are potentially useful for stress-tolerance improvement, three CIPK genes (OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15) were overexpressed in japonica rice 'Zhonghua 11'. Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively. Under cold and drought stresses, OsCIPK03- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type. Putative proline synthetase and transporter genes had significantly higher expression level in the transgenic plants than in the wild type. The differentially induced expression of OsCIPK genes by different stresses and the examples of improved stress tolerance of the OsCIPK transgenic rice suggest that rice CIPK genes have diverse roles in different stress responses and some of them may possess potential usefulness in stress-tolerance improvement of rice.
17468215	Down-regulation of a SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR2-related histone deacetylase gene, OsSRT1, induces DNA fragmentation and cell death in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	The SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR2 (SIR2) family proteins are NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases. Sir2 is involved in chromatin silencing at the mating-type loci, rDNA, and telomeres in yeast and is associated with lifespan extension in yeast, worms, and flies, but also in a broader range of additional functions. In this work, we investigated the role of OsSRT1, one of the two SIR2-related genes found in rice (Oryza sativa). We show that OsSRT1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein with higher levels in rapidly dividing tissues. OsSRT1 RNA interference induced an increase of histone H3K9 (lysine-9 of H3) acetylation and a decrease of H3K9 dimethylation, leading to H(2)O(2) production, DNA fragmentation, cell death, and lesions mimicking plant hypersensitive responses during incompatible interactions with pathogens, whereas overexpression of OsSRT1 enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. Transcript microarray analysis revealed that the transcription of many transposons and retrotransposons in addition to genes related to hypersensitive response and/or programmed cell death was activated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsSRT1 down-regulation induced histone H3K9 acetylation on the transposable elements and some of the hypersensitive response-related genes, suggesting that these genes may be among the primary targets of deacetylation regulated by OsSRT1. Our data together suggest that the rice SIR2-like gene is required for safeguard against genome instability and cell damage to ensure plant cell growth, but likely implicates different molecular mechanisms than yeast and animal homologs.
17496110	Comparative cross-species alternative splicing in plants.	2007	Plant Physiol	Alternative splicing (AS) can add significantly to genome complexity. Plants are thought to exhibit less AS than animals. An algorithm, based on expressed sequence tag (EST) pairs gapped alignment, was developed that takes advantage of the relatively small intron and exon size in plants and directly compares pairs of ESTs to search for AS. EST pairs gapped alignment was first evaluated in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) for which annotated genome sequence is available and was shown to accurately predict splicing events. The method was then applied to 11 plant species that include 17 cultivars for which enough ESTs are available. The results show a large, 3.7-fold difference in AS rates between plant species with Arabidopsis and rice in the lower range and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in the upper range. Hence, compared to higher animals, plants show a much greater degree of variety in their AS rates and in some plant species the rates of animal and plant AS are comparable although the distribution of AS types may differ. In eudicots but not monocots, a correlation between genome size and AS rates was detected, implying that in eudicots the mechanisms that lead to larger genomes are a driving force for the evolution of AS.
17556508	Genome-wide analysis of the core DNA replication machinery in the higher plants Arabidopsis and rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Core DNA replication proteins mediate the initiation, elongation, and Okazaki fragment maturation functions of DNA replication. Although this process is generally conserved in eukaryotes, important differences in the molecular architecture of the DNA replication machine and the function of individual subunits have been reported in various model systems. We have combined genome-wide bioinformatic analyses of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) with published experimental data to provide a comprehensive view of the core DNA replication machinery in plants. Many components identified in this analysis have not been studied previously in plant systems, including the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex (PSF1, PSF2, PSF3, and SLD5), MCM8, MCM9, MCM10, NOC3, POLA2, POLA3, POLA4, POLD3, POLD4, and RNASEH2. Our results indicate that the core DNA replication machinery from plants is more similar to vertebrates than single-celled yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), suggesting that animal models may be more relevant to plant systems. However, we also uncovered some important differences between plants and vertebrate machinery. For example, we did not identify geminin or RNASEH1 genes in plants. Our analyses also indicate that plants may be unique among eukaryotes in that they have multiple copies of numerous core DNA replication genes. This finding raises the question of whether specialized functions have evolved in some cases. This analysis establishes that the core DNA replication machinery is highly conserved across plant species and displays many features in common with other eukaryotes and some characteristics that are unique to plants.
17556504	Genome-wide gene expression profiling reveals conserved and novel molecular functions of the stigma in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	In angiosperms, the stigma provides initial nutrients and guidance cues for pollen grain germination and tube growth. However, little is known about the genes that regulate these processes in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we generate rice stigma-specific or -preferential gene expression profiles through comparing genome-wide expression patterns of hand-dissected, unpollinated stigma at anthesis with seven tissues, including seedling shoot, seedling root, mature anther, ovary at anthesis, seeds 5 d after pollination, 10-d-old embryo, 10-d-old endosperm, and suspension-cultured cells by using both 57 K Affymetrix rice whole-genome array and 10 K rice cDNA microarray. A high reproducibility of the microarray results was detected between the two different technology platforms. In total, we identified 548 genes to be expressed specifically or predominantly in the stigma papillar cells of rice. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of 34 selected genes all confirmed their stigma-specific expression. The expression of five selected genes was further validated by RNA in situ hybridization. Gene Ontology analysis shows that several auxin-signaling components, transcription, and stress-related genes are significantly overrepresented in the rice stigma gene set. Interestingly, most of them also share several cis-regulatory elements with known stress-responsive genes, supporting the notion of an overlap of genetic programs regulating pollination and stress/defense responses. We also found that genes involved in cell wall metabolism and cellular communication appear to be conserved in the stigma between rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Our results indicate that the stigmas appear to have conserved and novel molecular functions between rice and Arabidopsis.
17586689	Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells.	2007	Plant Physiol	We screened a rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare') full-length cDNA expression library through functional complementation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to find novel cation transporters involved in salt tolerance. We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (OsKAT1), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux. It also suppressed a K(+)-transport-defective phenotype of yeast strain CY162 (Deltatrk1Deltatrk2), suggesting the enhancement of K(+) uptake by OsKAT1. By the expression of OsKAT1, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase. At the linear phase, however, OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells accumulated less Na(+) than nonexpressing cells, but almost the same K(+). The cellular Na(+) to K(+) ratio of OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells remained lower than nonexpressing cells under saline conditions. Rice cells overexpressing OsKAT1 also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K(+) content. These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1. The expression of OsKAT1 was restricted to internodes and rachides of wild-type rice, whereas other Shaker family genes were expressed in various organs. These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+).
17586688	Characterization of SSIIIa-deficient mutants of rice: the function of SSIIIa and pleiotropic effects by SSIIIa deficiency in the rice endosperm.	2007	Plant Physiol	Starch synthase IIIa (SSIIIa)-deficient rice (Oryza sativa) mutants were generated using retrotransposon insertion and chemical mutagenesis. The lowest migrating SS activity bands on glycogen-containing native polyacrylamide gel, which were identified to be those for SSIIIa, were completely absent in these mutants, indicating that they are SSIIIa null mutants. The amylopectin B(2) to B(4) chains with degree of polymerization (DP) >/= 30 and the M(r) of amylopectin in the mutant were reduced to about 60% and 70% of the wild-type values, respectively, suggesting that SSIIIa plays an important part in the elongation of amylopectin B(2) to B(4) chains. Chains with DP 6 to 9 and DP 16 to 19 decreased while chains with DP 10 to 15 and DP 20 to 25 increased in the mutants amylopectin. These changes in the SSIIIa mutants are almost opposite images of those of SSI-deficient rice mutant and were caused by 1.3- to 1.7-fold increase of the amount of SSI in the mutants endosperm. Furthermore, the amylose content and the extralong chains (DP >/= 500) of amylopectin were increased by 1.3- and 12-fold, respectively. These changes in the composition in the mutants starch were caused by 1.4- to 1.7-fold increase in amounts of granules-bound starch synthase (GBSSI). The starch granules of the mutants were smaller with round shape, and were less crystalline. Thus, deficiency in SSIIIa, the second major SS isozyme in developing rice endosperm affected the structure of amylopectin, amylase content, and physicochemical properties of starch granules in two ways: directly by the SSIIIa deficiency itself and indirectly by the enhancement of both SSI and GBSSI gene transcripts.
17468223	Pea LATE BLOOMER1 is a GIGANTEA ortholog with roles in photoperiodic flowering, deetiolation, and transcriptional regulation of circadian clock gene homologs.	2007	Plant Physiol	Genes controlling the transition to flowering have been studied in several species, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), but have not yet received much attention in legumes. Here, we describe a new allelic series of late-flowering, photoperiod-insensitive mutants in the pea (Pisum sativum) LATE BLOOMER1 (LATE1) gene and show that LATE1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA. Mutants display defects in phytochrome B-dependent deetiolation under red light and in the diurnal regulation of pea homologs of several Arabidopsis circadian clock genes, including TIMING OF CAB1, EARLY FLOWERING4, and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1/LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL. LATE1 itself shows strongly rhythmic expression with a small but distinct acute peak following dark-to-light transfer. Mutations in LATE1 prevent the induction of a FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) homolog FTL in long days but cause only minor alteration to the rhythmic expression pattern of the only known group Ia CONSTANS homolog COLa. The late-flowering phenotype of late1 mutants can be completely rescued by grafting to the wild type, but this rescue is not associated with a significant increase in FTL transcript level in shoot apices. Genetic interactions of late1 with the photoperiod-insensitive, early-flowering sterile nodes (sn) mutant and impairment of the LATE1 diurnal expression rhythm in sn plants suggest that SN may also affect the circadian clock. These results show that several functions of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA are conserved in its pea ortholog and demonstrate that genetic pathways for photoperiodic flowering are likely to be conserved between these two species. They also suggest that in addition to its role in the floral transition, LATE1 also acts throughout reproductive development.
17468221	TILLING mutants of Lotus japonicus reveal that nitrogen assimilation and fixation can occur in the absence of nodule-enhanced sucrose synthase.	2007	Plant Physiol	In all plant species studied to date, sucrose synthase occurs as multiple isoforms. The specific functions of the different isoforms are for the most part not clear. Six isoforms of sucrose synthase have been identified in the model legume Lotus japonicus, the same number as in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). The genes encoding these isoforms are differentially expressed in all plant organs examined, although one, LjSUS4, is only expressed in flowers. LjSUS1 is the most highly expressed in all plant organs tested, except root nodules, where LjSUS3 accounts for more than 60% of the total SUS transcripts. One gene, LjSUS2, produces two transcripts due to alternative splicing, a feature not observed in other species to date. We have isolated plants carrying ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations in several SUS genes by targeting-induced local lesions in genomes reverse genetics and examined the effect of null alleles of two genes, LjSUS1 and LjSUS3, on nodule function. No differences were observed between the mutants and wild-type plants under glasshouse conditions, but there was evidence for a nitrogen-starvation phenotype in the sus3-1 mutant and severe impairment of growth in the sus1-1/sus3-1 double mutant under specific environmental conditions. Nodules of sus3-1 mutant plants retained a capacity for nitrogen fixation under all conditions. Thus, nitrogen fixation can occur in L. japonicus nodules even in the absence of LjSUS3 (the major nodule-induced isoform of SUS), so LjSUS1 must also contribute to the maintenance of nitrogen assimilation.
17932303	The pCLEAN dual binary vector system for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation.	2007	Plant Physiol	The development of novel transformation vectors is essential to the improvement of plant transformation technologies. Here, we report the construction and testing of a new multifunctional dual binary vector system, pCLEAN, for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. The pCLEAN vectors are based on the widely used pGreen/pSoup system and the pCLEAN-G/pCLEAN-S plasmids are fully compatible with the existing pGreen/pSoup vectors. A single Agrobacterium can harbor (1) pCLEAN-G and pSoup, (2) pGreen and pCLEAN-S, or (3) pCLEAN-G and pCLEAN-S vector combination. pCLEAN vectors have been designed to enable the delivery of multiple transgenes from distinct T-DNAs and/or vector backbone sequences while minimizing the insertion of superfluous DNA sequences into the plant nuclear genome as well as facilitating the production of marker-free plants. pCLEAN vectors contain a minimal T-DNA (102 nucleotides) consisting of direct border repeats surrounding a 52-nucleotide-long multiple cloning site, an optimized left-border sequence, a double left-border sequence, restriction sites outside the borders, and two independent T-DNAs. In addition, selectable and/or reporter genes have been inserted into the vector backbone sequence to allow either the counter-screening of backbone transfer or its exploitation for the production of marker-free plants. The efficiency of the different pCLEAN vectors has been assessed using transient and stable transformation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and/or Oryza sativa.
17951464	Identification and characterization of lineage-specific genes within the Poaceae.	2007	Plant Physiol	Using the rice (Oryza sativa) sp. japonica genome annotation, along with genomic sequence and clustered transcript assemblies from 184 species in the plant kingdom, we have identified a set of 861 rice genes that are evolutionarily conserved among six diverse species within the Poaceae yet lack significant sequence similarity with plant species outside the Poaceae. This set of evolutionarily conserved and lineage-specific rice genes is termed conserved Poaceae-specific genes (CPSGs) to reflect the presence of significant sequence similarity across three separate Poaceae subfamilies. The vast majority of rice CPSGs (86.6%) encode proteins with no putative function or functionally characterized protein domain. For the remaining CPSGs, 8.8% encode an F-box domain-containing protein and 4.5% encode a protein with a putative function. On average, the CPSGs have fewer exons, shorter total gene length, and elevated GC content when compared with genes annotated as either transposable elements (TEs) or those genes having significant sequence similarity in a species outside the Poaceae. Multiple sequence alignments of the CPSGs with sequences from other Poaceae species show conservation across a putative domain, a novel domain, or the entire coding length of the protein. At the genome level, syntenic alignments between sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and 103 of the 861 rice CPSGs (12.0%) could be made, demonstrating an additional level of conservation for this set of genes within the Poaceae. The extensive sequence similarity in evolutionarily distinct species within the Poaceae family and an additional screen for TE-related structural characteristics and sequence discounts these CPSGs as being misannotated TEs. Collectively, these data confirm that we have identified a specific set of genes that are highly conserved within, as well as specific to, the Poaceae.
17932309	Maize Brittle stalk2 encodes a COBRA-like protein expressed in early organ development but required for tissue flexibility at maturity.	2007	Plant Physiol	The maize (Zea mays) brittle stalk2 (bk2) is a recessive mutant, the aerial parts of which are easily broken. The bk2 phenotype is developmentally regulated and appears 4 weeks after planting, at about the fifth-leaf stage. Before this time, mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type siblings. Afterward, all organs of the bk2 mutants turn brittle, even the preexisting ones, and they remain brittle throughout the life of the plant. Leaf tension assays and bend tests of the internodes show that the brittle phenotype does not result from loss of tensile strength but from loss in flexibility that causes the tissues to snap instead of bend. The Bk2 gene was cloned by a combination of transposon tagging and a candidate gene approach and found to encode a COBRA-like protein similar to rice (Oryza sativa) BC1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) COBRA-LIKE4. The outer periphery of the stalk has fewer vascular bundles, and the sclerids underlying the epidermis possess thinner secondary walls. Relative cellulose content is not strictly correlated with the brittle phenotype. Cellulose content in mature zones of bk2 mature stems is lowered by 40% but is about the same as wild type in developing stems. Although relative cellulose content is lowered in leaves after the onset of the brittle phenotype, total wall mass as a proportion of dry mass is either unchanged or slightly increased, indicating a compensatory increase in noncellulosic carbohydrate mass. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated an increase in phenolic ester content in the walls of bk2 leaves and stems. Total content of lignin is unaffected in bk2 juvenile leaves before or after appearance of the brittle phenotype, but bk2 mature and developing stems are markedly enriched in lignin compared to wild-type stems. Despite increased lignin in bk2 stems, loss of staining with phloroglucinol and ultraviolet autofluorescence is observed in vascular bundles and sclerid layers. Consistent with the infrared analyses, levels of saponifiable hydroxycinnamates are elevated in bk2 leaves and stems. As Bk2 is highly expressed during early development, well before the onset of the brittle phenotype, we propose that Bk2 functions in a patterning of lignin-cellulosic interactions that maintain organ flexibility rather than having a direct role in cellulose biosynthesis.
17951465	OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a.	2007	Plant Physiol	Although flowering regulatory mechanisms have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), those in other species have not been well elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of OsMADS51, a type I MADS-box gene in the short-day (SD) promotion pathway in rice (Oryza sativa). In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering. Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged. Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs. In ectopic expression lines, transcript levels of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a were increased, but those of OsGI and Hd1 remained the same. These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a. To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed. In Ehd1 RNA interference plants, OsMADS51 expression was not affected, supporting our conclusion that the MADS-box gene functions upstream of Ehd1. However, in OsGI antisense plants, the OsMADS51 transcript level was reduced. In addition, the circadian expression pattern for this MADS-box gene was similar to that for OsGI. These results demonstrate that OsMADS51 functions downstream of OsGI. In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1.
17951462	Genomic organization and evolutionary conservation of plant D-type cyclins.	2007	Plant Physiol	Plants contain more genes encoding core cell cycle regulators than other organisms but it is unclear whether these represent distinct functions. D-type cyclins (CYCD) play key roles in the G1-to-S-phase transition, and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains 10 CYCD genes in seven defined subgroups, six of which are conserved in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we identify 22 CYCD genes in the poplar (Populus trichocarpa) genome and confirm that these six CYCD subgroups are conserved across higher plants, suggesting subgroup-specific functions. Different subgroups show gene number increases, with CYCD3 having three members in Arabidopsis, six in poplar, and a single representative in rice. All three species contain a single CYCD7 gene. Despite low overall sequence homology, we find remarkable conservation of intron/exon boundaries, because in most CYCD genes of plants and mammals, the first exon ends in the conserved cyclin signature. Only CYCD3 genes contain the complete cyclin box in a single exon, and this structure is conserved across angiosperms, again suggesting an early origin for the subgroup. The single CYCD gene of moss has a gene structure closely related to those of higher plants, sharing an identical exon/intron structure with several higher plant subgroups. However, green algae have CYCD genes structurally unrelated to higher plants. Conservation is also observed in the location of potential cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites within CYCD proteins. Subgroup structure is supported by conserved regulatory elements, particularly in the eudicot species, including conserved E2F regulatory sites within CYCD3 promoters. Global expression correlation analysis further supports distinct expression patterns for CYCD subgroups.
17965173	Fungal symbiosis in rice requires an ortholog of a legume common symbiosis gene encoding a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.	2007	Plant Physiol	In natural ecosystems, many plants are able to establish mutually beneficial symbioses with microorganisms. Of critical importance to sustainable agriculture are the symbioses formed between more than 80% of terrestrial plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and between legumes and nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria. Interestingly, the two symbioses share overlapping signaling pathways in legumes, suggesting that the evolutionarily recent root nodule symbiosis may have acquired functions from the ancient AM symbiosis. The Medicago truncatula DMI3 (DOESN'T MAKE INFECTIONS3) gene (MtDMI3) and its orthologs in legumes are required for both bacterial and fungal symbioses. MtDMI3 encodes a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) essential for the transduction of the Ca(2+) signal induced by the perception of Nod factors. Putative orthologs of MtDMI3 are also present in non-legumes, but their function in AM symbiosis has not been demonstrated in any non-legume species. Here, we combine reverse genetic approaches and a cross-species complementation test to characterize the function of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog of MtDMI3, namely, OsDMI3, in AM symbiosis. We demonstrate that OsDMI3 is not only required for AM symbiosis in rice but also is able to complement a M. truncatula dmi3 mutant, indicating an equivalent role of MtDMI3 orthologs in non-legumes.
17951455	Mutation in nicotianamine aminotransferase stimulated the Fe(II) acquisition system and led to iron accumulation in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Higher plants acquire iron (Fe) from the rhizosphere through two strategies. Strategy II, employed by graminaceous plants, involves secretion of phytosiderophores (e.g. deoxymugineic acid in rice [Oryza sativa]) by roots to solubilize Fe(III) in soil. In addition to taking up Fe in the form of Fe(III)-phytosiderophore, rice also possesses the strategy I-like system that may absorb Fe(II) directly. Through mutant screening, we isolated a rice mutant that could not grow with Fe(III)-citrate as the sole Fe source, but was able to grow when Fe(II)-EDTA was supplied. Surprisingly, the mutant accumulated more Fe and other divalent metals in roots and shoots than the wild type when both were supplied with EDTA-Fe(II) or grown under water-logged field conditions. Furthermore, the mutant had a significantly higher concentration of Fe in both unpolished and polished grains than the wild type. Using the map-based cloning method, we identified a point mutation in a gene encoding nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT1), which was responsible for the mutant phenotype. Because of the loss of function of NAAT1, the mutant failed to produce deoxymugineic acid and could not absorb Fe(III) efficiently. In contrast, nicotianamine, the substrate for NAAT1, accumulated markedly in roots and shoots of the mutant. Microarray analysis showed that the expression of a number of the genes involved in Fe(II) acquisition was greatly stimulated in the naat1 mutant. Our results demonstrate that disruption of deoxymugineic acid biosynthesis can stimulate Fe(II) acquisition and increase iron accumulation in rice.
17704235	AtHIPM, an ortholog of the apple HrpN-interacting protein, is a negative regulator of plant growth and mediates the growth-enhancing effect of HrpN in Arabidopsis.	2007	Plant Physiol	HrpN (harpin) protein is critical to the virulence of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora in host plants like apple (Malus x domestica). Moreover, exogenous treatment of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a nonhost plant, with partially purified HrpN enhances growth. To address the bases of the effects of HrpN in disease, we sought a HrpN-interacting protein(s) in apple, using a yeast two-hybrid assay. A single positive clone, designated HIPM (HrpN-interacting protein from Malus), was found. HIPM, a 6.5-kD protein, interacted with HrpN in yeast and in vitro. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal 198 of 403 amino acids of HrpN are required for interaction with HIPM. HIPM orthologs were found in Arabidopsis (AtHIPM) and rice (Oryza sativa; OsHIPM). HrpN also interacted with AtHIPM in yeast and in vitro. In silico analyses revealed that the three plant proteins contain putative signal peptides and putative transmembrane domains. We showed that both HIPM and AtHIPM have functional signal peptides, and green fluorescent protein-tagged HIPM and AtHIPM associated, in clusters, with plasma membranes. Both HIPM and AtHIPM are expressed constitutively; however, they are expressed more strongly in apple and Arabidopsis flowers than in leaves and stems. The size of AtHIPM knockout mutant plants of Arabidopsis was slightly larger than the wild-type plants. Interestingly, the knockout mutant did not exhibit enhanced plant growth in response to treatment with HrpN. Overexpression of AtHIPM conversely resulted in smaller plants. These results indicate that AtHIPM functions as a negative regulator of plant growth and mediates enhanced growth that results from treatment with HrpN.
17827266	Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein.	2007	Plant Physiol	P(1B)-type heavy-metal ATPases (HMAs) are transmembrane metal-transporting proteins that play a key role in metal homeostasis. Despite their importance, very little is known about their functions in monocot species. We report the characterization of rice (Oryza sativa) OsHMA9, a member of the P(1B)-type ATPase family. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium. We also determined, through promoterbeta-glucuronidase analysis, that the main expression was in the vascular bundles and anthers. The OsHMA9:green fluorescence protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane. Heterologous expression of OsHMA9 partially rescued the Cu sensitivity of the Escherichia coli copA mutant, which is defective in Cu-transporting ATPases. It did not rescue the Zn sensitivity of the zntA mutant, which is defective in Zn-transporting ATPase. To further elucidate the functional roles of OsHMA9, we isolated two independent null alleles, oshma9-1 and oshma9-2, from the T-DNA insertion population. Mutant plants exhibited the phenotype of increased sensitivity to elevated levels of Cu, Zn, and lead. These results support a role for OsHMA9 in Cu, Zn, and lead efflux from the cells. This article is the first report on the functional characterization of a P(1B)-type metal efflux transporter in monocots.
17905867	Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly silicon (Si)-accumulating species that shows genotypic differences in Si accumulation. We investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the genotypic difference in Si uptake between the japonica var. Nipponbare and the indica var. Kasalath. Both the Si concentration in the shoot and the Si uptake per root dry weight were higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath grown in either soil or nutrient solution. The Si uptake by a single root was also higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. A kinetics study showed that Nipponbare and Kasalath had a similar K(m) value, whereas the V(max) was higher in Nipponbare. The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots. These results revealed that the genotypic difference in the Si accumulation results from the difference in abundance of Si transporters in rice roots.
17993541	A versatile transposon-based activation tag vector system for functional genomics in cereals and other monocot plants.	2008	Plant Physiol	Transposon insertional mutagenesis is an effective alternative to T-DNA mutagenesis when transformation through tissue culture is inefficient as is the case for many crop species. When used as activation tags, transposons can be exploited to generate novel gain-of-function phenotypes without transformation and are of particular value in the study of polyploid plants where gene knockouts will not have phenotypes. We have developed an in cis-activation-tagging Ac-Ds transposon system in which a T-DNA vector carries a Dissociation (Ds) element containing 4x cauliflower mosaic virus enhancers along with the Activator (Ac) transposase gene. Stable Ds insertions were selected using green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein genes driven by promoters that are functional in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa). The system has been tested in rice, where 638 stable Ds insertions were selected from an initial set of 26 primary transformants. By analysis of 311 flanking sequences mapped to the rice genome, we could demonstrate the wide distribution of the elements over the rice chromosomes. Enhanced expression of rice genes adjacent to Ds insertions was detected in the insertion lines using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR method. The in cis-two-element vector system requires minimal number of primary transformants and eliminates the need for crossing, while the use of fluorescent markers instead of antibiotic or herbicide resistance increases the applicability to other plants and eliminates problems with escapes. Because Ac-Ds has been shown to transpose widely in the plant kingdom, the activation vector system developed in this study should be of utility more generally to other monocots.
17981989	Glufosinate ammonium-induced pathogen inhibition and defense responses culminate in disease protection in bar-transgenic rice.	2008	Plant Physiol	Glufosinate ammonium diminished developments of rice (Oryza sativa) blast and brown leaf spot in 35S:bar-transgenic rice. Pre- and postinoculation treatments of this herbicide reduced disease development. Glufosinate ammonium specifically impeded appressorium formation of the pathogens Magnaporthe grisea and Cochliobolus miyabeanus on hydrophobic surface and on transgenic rice. In contrast, conidial germination remained unaffected. Glufosinate ammonium diminished mycelial growth of two pathogens; however, this inhibitory effect was attenuated in malnutrition conditions. Glufosinate ammonium caused slight chlorosis and diminished chlorophyll content; however, these alterations were almost completely restored in transgenic rice within 7 d. Glufosinate ammonium triggered transcriptions of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR) genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in transgenic rice and PR1 transcription in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild-type ecotype Columbia harboring 35S:bar construct. All transgenic Arabidopsis showed robust hydrogen peroxide accumulation by glufosinate ammonium. This herbicide also induced PR1 transcription in etr1 and jar1 expressing bar; however, no expression was observed in NahG and npr1. Fungal infection did not alter transcriptions of PR genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation induced by glufosinate ammonium. Infiltration of glufosinate ammonium did not affect appressorium formation of M. grisea in vivo but inhibited blast disease development. Hydrogen peroxide scavengers nullified blast protection and transcriptions of PR genes by glufosinate ammonium; however, they did not affect brown leaf spot progression. In sum, both direct inhibition of pathogen infection and activation of defense systems were responsible for disease protection in bar-transgenic rice.
17993543	A genomic and expression compendium of the expanded PEBP gene family from maize.	2008	Plant Physiol	The phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) represent an ancient protein family found across the biosphere. In animals they are known to act as kinase and serine protease inhibitors controlling cell growth and differentiation. In plants the most extensively studied PEBP genes, the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) genes, function, respectively, as a promoter and a repressor of the floral transition. Twenty-five maize (Zea mays) genes that encode PEBP-like proteins, likely the entire gene family, were identified and named Zea mays CENTRORADIALIS (ZCN), after the first described plant PEBP gene from Antirrhinum. The maize family is expanded relative to eudicots (typically six to eight genes) and rice (Oryza sativa; 19 genes). Genomic structures, map locations, and syntenous relationships with rice were determined for 24 of the maize ZCN genes. Phylogenetic analysis assigned the maize ZCN proteins to three major subfamilies: TFL1-like (six members), MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1-like (three), and FT-like (15). Expression analysis demonstrated transcription for at least 21 ZCN genes, many with developmentally specific patterns and some having alternatively spliced transcripts. Expression patterns and protein structural analysis identified maize candidates likely having conserved gene function of TFL1. Expression patterns and interaction of the ZCN8 protein with the floral activator DLF1 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assay strongly supports that ZCN8 plays an orthologous FT function in maize. The expression of other ZCN genes in roots, kernels, and flowers implies their involvement in diverse developmental processes.
18065552	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice.	2008	Plant Physiol	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
18156295	Evolutionary radiation pattern of novel protein phosphatases revealed by analysis of protein data from the completely sequenced genomes of humans, green algae, and higher plants.	2008	Plant Physiol	In addition to the major serine/threonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase, Mg(2+)-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase, and protein tyrosine phosphatase families, there are novel protein phosphatases, including enzymes with aspartic acid-based catalysis and subfamilies of protein tyrosine phosphatases, whose evolutionary history and representation in plants is poorly characterized. We have searched the protein data sets encoded by the well-finished nuclear genomes of the higher plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and Oryza sativa, and the latest draft data sets from the tree Populus trichocarpa and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri, for homologs to several classes of novel protein phosphatases. The Arabidopsis proteins, in combination with previously published data, provide a complete inventory of known types of protein phosphatases in this organism. Phylogenetic analysis of these proteins reveals a pattern of evolution where a diverse set of protein phosphatases was present early in the history of eukaryotes, and the division of plant and animal evolution resulted in two distinct sets of protein phosphatases. The green algae occupy an intermediate position, and show similarity to both plants and animals, depending on the protein. Of specific interest are the lack of cell division cycle (CDC) phosphatases CDC25 and CDC14, and the seeming adaptation of CDC14 as a protein interaction domain in higher plants. In addition, there is a dramatic increase in proteins containing RNA polymerase C-terminal domain phosphatase-like catalytic domains in the higher plants. Expression analysis of Arabidopsis phosphatase genes differentially amplified in plants (specifically the C-terminal domain phosphatase-like phosphatases) shows patterns of tissue-specific expression with a statistically significant number of correlated genes encoding putative signal transduction proteins.
18032588	TEnest: automated chronological annotation and visualization of nested plant transposable elements.	2008	Plant Physiol	Organisms with a high density of transposable elements (TEs) exhibit nesting, with subsequent repeats found inside previously inserted elements. Nesting splits the sequence structure of TEs and makes annotation of repetitive areas challenging. We present TEnest, a repeat identification and display tool made specifically for highly repetitive genomes. TEnest identifies repetitive sequences and reconstructs separated sections to provide full-length repeats and, for long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, calculates age since insertion based on LTR divergence. TEnest provides a chronological insertion display to give an accurate visual representation of TE integration history showing timeline, location, and families of each TE identified, thus creating a framework from which evolutionary comparisons can be made among various regions of the genome. A database of repeats has been developed for maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare) to illustrate the potential of TEnest software. All currently finished maize bacterial artificial chromosomes totaling 29.3 Mb were analyzed with TEnest to provide a characterization of the repeat insertions. Sixty-seven percent of the maize genome was found to be made up of TEs; of these, 95% are LTR retrotransposons. The rate of solo LTR formation is shown to be dissimilar across retrotransposon families. Phylogenetic analysis of TE families reveals specific events of extreme TE proliferation, which may explain the high quantities of certain TE families found throughout the maize genome. The TEnest software package is available for use on PlantGDB under the tools section (http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/TE_nest/TE_nest.html); the source code is available from (http://wiselab.org).
18083797	Cell wall polysaccharides are specifically involved in the exclusion of aluminum from the rice root apex.	2008	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is the most aluminum (Al)-resistant crop species among the small-grain cereals, but the mechanisms responsible for this trait are still unclear. Using two rice cultivars differing in Al resistance, rice sp. japonica 'Nipponbare' (an Al-resistant cultivar) and rice sp. indica 'Zhefu802' (an Al-sensitive cultivar), it was found that Al content in the root apex (0-10 mm) was significantly lower in Al-resistant 'Nipponbare' than in sensitive 'Zhefu802', with more of the Al localized to cell walls in 'Zhefu802', indicating that an Al exclusion mechanism is operating in 'Nipponbare'. However, neither organic acid efflux nor changes in rhizosphere pH appear to be responsible for the Al exclusion. Interestingly, cell wall polysaccharides (pectin, hemicellulose 1, and hemicellulose 2) in the root apex were found to be significantly higher in 'Zhefu802' than in 'Nipponbare' in the absence of Al, and Al exposure increased root apex hemicellulose content more significantly in 'Zhefu802'. Root tip cell wall pectin methylesterase (PME) activity was constitutively higher in 'Zhefu802' than in 'Nipponbare', although Al treatment resulted in increased PME activity in both cultivars. Immunolocalization of pectins showed a higher proportion of demethylated pectins in 'Zhefu802', indicating a higher proportion of free pectic acid residues in the cell walls of 'Zhefu802' root tips. Al adsorption and desorption kinetics of root tip cell walls also indicated that more Al was adsorbed and bound Al was retained more tightly in 'Zhefu802', which was consistent with Al content, PME activity, and pectin demethylesterification results. These responses were specific to Al compared with other metals (CdCl(2), LaCl(3), and CuCl(2)), and the ability of the cell wall to adsorb these metals was also not related to levels of cell wall pectins. All of these results suggest that cell wall polysaccharides may play an important role in excluding Al specifically from the rice root apex.
16403737	Oryzabase. An integrated biological and genome information database for rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	The aim of Oryzabase is to create a comprehensive view of rice (Oryza sativa) as a model monocot plant by integrating biological data with molecular genomic information (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/top/top.jsp). The database contains information about rice development and anatomy, rice mutants, and genetic resources, especially for wild varieties of rice. The anatomical description of rice development is unique and is the first known representation for rice. Developmental and anatomical descriptions include in situ gene expression data serving as stage and tissue markers. The systematic presentation of a large number of rice mutant and mutant trait genes is indispensable, as is description of research in wild strains, core collections, and their detailed characterization. Several genetic, physical, and expression maps with full genome and cDNA sequences are also combined with biological data in Oryzabase. These datasets, when pooled together, could provide a useful tool for gaining greater knowledge about the life cycle of rice, the relationship between phenotype and gene function, and rice genetic diversity. For exchanging community information, Oryzabase publishes the Rice Genetics Newsletter organized by the Rice Genetics Cooperative and provides a mailing service, rice-e-net/rice-net.
16361516	Overexpression of RAN1 in rice and Arabidopsis alters primordial meristem, mitotic progress, and sensitivity to auxin.	2006	Plant Physiol	Ran is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic GTPase. We previously identified a cDNA of TaRAN1, a novel Ran GTPase homologous gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and demonstrated that TaRAN1 is associated with regulation of genome integrity and cell division in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) systems. However, much less is known about the function of RAN in plant development. To analyze the possible biological roles of Ran GTPase, we overexpressed TaRAN1 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). TaRAN1 overexpression increased the proportion of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which resulted in an elevated mitotic index and prolonged life cycle. Furthermore, it led to increased primordial tissue, reduced number of lateral roots, and stimulated hypersensitivity to exogenous auxin. The results suggest that Ran protein was involved in the regulation of mitotic progress, either in the shoot apical meristem or the root meristem zone in plants, where auxin signaling is involved. This article determines the function of RAN in plant development mediated by the cell cycle and its novel role in meristem initiation mediated by auxin signaling.
16407444	Genome-wide analysis of the ERF gene family in Arabidopsis and rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Genes in the ERF family encode transcriptional regulators with a variety of functions involved in the developmental and physiological processes in plants. In this study, a comprehensive computational analysis identified 122 and 139 ERF family genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica), respectively. A complete overview of this gene family in Arabidopsis is presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny, chromosome locations, and conserved motifs. In addition, a comparative analysis between these genes in Arabidopsis and rice was performed. As a result of these analyses, the ERF families in Arabidopsis and rice were divided into 12 and 15 groups, respectively, and several of these groups were further divided into subgroups. Based on the observation that 11 of these groups were present in both Arabidopsis and rice, it was concluded that the major functional diversification within the ERF family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. In contrast, some groups/subgroups are species specific. We discuss the relationship between the structure and function of the ERF family proteins based on these results and published information. It was further concluded that the expansion of the ERF family in plants might have been due to chromosomal/segmental duplication and tandem duplication, as well as more ancient transposition and homing. These results will be useful for future functional analyses of the ERF family genes.
16384900	Global patterns of gene expression in the aleurone of wild-type and dwarf1 mutant rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	The cereal aleurone layer is a model system for studying the regulation of transcription by gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA). GA stimulates and ABA prevents the transcription of genes for alpha-amylases and other secreted hydrolytic enzymes, but how GA and ABA affect the transcription of other genes is largely unknown. We characterized gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa) aleurone using a half-genome rice microarray. Of the 23,000 probe sets on the chip, approximately 11,000 hybridized with RNA from rice aleurone treated with ABA, GA, or no hormone. As expected, GA regulated the expression of many genes, and 3 times as many genes were up-regulated by GA at 8 h than were down-regulated. Changes in gene expression resulting from ABA treatment were not consistent with the hypothesis that the role of ABA in this tissue is primarily to repress gene expression, and 10 times more genes were up-regulated by ABA at 8 h than were down-regulated by ABA. We also measured transcript abundance in aleurone of dwarf1 (d1) mutant rice. The d1 protein is the sole alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins in rice. Genes up-regulated by GA or ABA had higher expression in wild type than in d1 aleurone, and genes down-regulated by GA had lower expression in wild type relative to d1 aleurone. The d1 mutation did not result in a decrease in sensitivity to GA at the level of transcription. Rather, changes in transcript abundance were smaller in the d1 mutant than in wild type.
16384895	Proteomics of Rac GTPase signaling reveals its predominant role in elicitor-induced defense response of cultured rice cells.	2006	Plant Physiol	We have previously shown that a human small GTPase Rac homolog, OsRac1, from rice (Oryza sativa) induces cascades of defense responses in rice plants and cultured cells. Sphingolipid elicitors (SEs) have been similarly shown to activate defense responses in rice. Therefore, to systematically analyze proteins whose expression levels are altered by OsRac1 and/or SE treatment, we performed a differential display analysis of proteins by the use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A total of 271 proteins whose expression levels were altered by constitutively active (CA)-OsRac1 or SE were identified. Interestingly, of 100 proteins that were up-regulated by a SE, 87 were also induced by CA-OsRac1, suggesting that OsRac1 plays a pivotal role in defense responses induced by SE in cultured rice cells. In addition, CA-OsRac1 induces the expression of 119 proteins. Many proteins, such as pathogenesis-related proteins, SGT1, and prohibitin, which are known to be involved in the defense response, were found among these proteins. Proteins involved in redox regulation, chaperones such as heat shock proteins, BiP, and chaperonin 60, proteases and protease inhibitors, cytoskeletal proteins, subunits of proteasomes, and enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid and ethylene biosynthesis pathways were found to be induced by CA-OsRac1 or SE. Results of our proteomic analysis revealed that OsRac1 is able to induce many proteins in various signaling and metabolic pathways and plays a predominant role in the defense response in cultured rice cells.
16443699	Function and characterization of starch synthase I using mutants in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Four starch synthase I (SSI)-deficient rice (Oryza sativa) mutant lines were generated using retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. The mutants exhibited different levels of SSI activities and produced significantly lower amounts of SSI protein ranging from 0% to 20% of the wild type. The mutant endosperm amylopectin showed a decrease in chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 8 to 12 and an increase in chains with DP 6 to 7 and DP 16 to 19. The degree of change in amylopectin chain-length distribution was positively correlated with the extent of decrease in SSI activity in the mutants. The structural changes in the amylopectin increased the gelatinization temperature of endosperm starch. Chain-length analysis of amylopectin in the SSI band excised from native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/SS activity staining gel showed that SSI preferentially synthesized DP 7 to 11 chains by elongating DP 4 to 7 short chains of glycogen or amylopectin. These results show that SSI distinctly generates DP 8 to 12 chains from short DP 6 to 7 chains emerging from the branch point in the A or B(1) chain of amylopectin. SSI seemingly functions from the very early through the late stage of endosperm development. Yet, the complete absence of SSI, despite being a major SS isozyme in the developing endosperm, had no effect on the size and shape of seeds and starch granules and the crystallinity of endosperm starch, suggesting that other SS enzymes are probably capable of partly compensating SSI function. In summary, this study strongly suggested that amylopectin chains are synthesized by the coordinated actions of SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa isoforms.
16524980	Abundantly and rarely expressed Lhc protein genes exhibit distinct regulation patterns in plants.	2006	Plant Physiol	We have analyzed gene regulation of the Lhc supergene family in poplar (Populus spp.) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using digital expression profiling. Multivariate analysis of the tissue-specific, environmental, and developmental Lhc expression patterns in Arabidopsis and poplar was employed to characterize four rarely expressed Lhc genes, Lhca5, Lhca6, Lhcb7, and Lhcb4.3. Those genes have high expression levels under different conditions and in different tissues than the abundantly expressed Lhca1 to 4 and Lhcb1 to 6 genes that code for the 10 major types of higher plant light-harvesting proteins. However, in some of the datasets analyzed, the Lhcb4 and Lhcb6 genes as well as an Arabidopsis gene not present in poplar (Lhcb2.3) exhibited minor differences to the main cooperative Lhc gene expression pattern. The pattern of the rarely expressed Lhc genes was always found to be more similar to that of PsbS and the various light-harvesting-like genes, which might indicate distinct physiological functions for the rarely and abundantly expressed Lhc proteins. The previously undetected Lhcb7 gene encodes a novel plant Lhcb-type protein that possibly contains an additional, fourth, transmembrane N-terminal helix with a highly conserved motif. As the Lhcb4.3 gene seems to be present only in Eurosid species and as its regulation pattern varies significantly from that of Lhcb4.1 and Lhcb4.2, we conclude it to encode a distinct Lhc protein type, Lhcb8.
16415213	A segment of the apospory-specific genomic region is highly microsyntenic not only between the apomicts Pennisetum squamulatum and buffelgrass, but also with a rice chromosome 11 centromeric-proximal genomic region.	2006	Plant Physiol	Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from apomicts Pennisetum squamulatum and buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), isolated with the apospory-specific genomic region (ASGR) marker ugt197, were assembled into contigs that were extended by chromosome walking. Gene-like sequences from contigs were identified by shotgun sequencing and BLAST searches, and used to isolate orthologous rice contigs. Additional gene-like sequences in the apomicts' contigs were identified by bioinformatics using fully sequenced BACs from orthologous rice contigs as templates, as well as by interspecies, whole-contig cross-hybridizations. Hierarchical contig orthology was rapidly assessed by constructing detailed long-range contig molecular maps showing the distribution of gene-like sequences and markers, and searching for microsyntenic patterns of sequence identity and spatial distribution within and across species contigs. We found microsynteny between P. squamulatum and buffelgrass contigs. Importantly, this approach also enabled us to isolate from within the rice (Oryza sativa) genome contig Rice A, which shows the highest microsynteny and is most orthologous to the ugt197-containing C1C buffelgrass contig. Contig Rice A belongs to the rice genome database contig 77 (according to the current September 12, 2003, rice fingerprint contig build) that maps proximal to the chromosome 11 centromere, a feature that interestingly correlates with the mapping of ASGR-linked BACs proximal to the centromere or centromere-like sequences. Thus, relatedness between these two orthologous contigs is supported both by their molecular microstructure and by their centromeric-proximal location. Our discoveries promote the use of a microsynteny-based positional-cloning approach using the rice genome as a template to aid in constructing the ASGR toward the isolation of genes underlying apospory.
16461379	Protein profiling of plastoglobules in chloroplasts and chromoplasts. A surprising site for differential accumulation of metabolic enzymes.	2006	Plant Physiol	Plastoglobules (PGs) are oval or tubular lipid-rich structures present in all plastid types, but their specific functions are unclear. PGs contain quinones, alpha-tocopherol, and lipids and, in chromoplasts, carotenoids as well. It is not known whether PGs contain any enzymes or regulatory proteins. Here, we determined the proteome of PGs from chloroplasts of stressed and unstressed leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as well as from pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit chromoplasts using mass spectrometry. Together, this showed that the proteome of chloroplast PGs consists of seven fibrillins, providing a protein coat and preventing coalescence of the PGs, and an additional 25 proteins likely involved in metabolism of isoprenoid-derived molecules (quinines and tocochromanols), lipids, and carotenoid cleavage. Four unknown ABC1 kinases were identified, possibly involved in regulation of quinone monooxygenases. Most proteins have not been observed earlier but have predicted N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides and lack transmembrane domains, consistent with localization in the PG lipid monolayer particles. Quantitative differences in PG composition in response to high light stress and degreening were determined by differential stable-isotope labeling using formaldehyde. More than 20 proteins were identified in the PG proteome of pepper chromoplasts, including four enzymes of carotenoid biosynthesis and several homologs of proteins observed in the chloroplast PGs. Our data strongly suggest that PGs in chloroplasts form a functional metabolic link between the inner envelope and thylakoid membranes and play a role in breakdown of carotenoids and oxidative stress defense, whereas PGs in chromoplasts are also an active site for carotenoid conversions.
16607027	Abiotic stress in rice. An "omic" approach.	2006	Plant Physiol	
16607028	MEKHLA, a novel domain with similarity to PAS domains, is fused to plant homeodomain-leucine zipper III proteins.	2006	Plant Physiol	Homeodomain (HD) proteins play important roles in the development of plants, fungi, and animals. Here we identify a novel domain, MEKHLA, in the C terminus of HD-Leu zipper (HD-ZIP) III plant HD proteins that shares similarity with a group of bacterial proteins and a protein from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The group of bacterial MEKHLA proteins is found in cyanobacteria and other bacteria often found associated with plants. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a MEKHLA protein transferred, possibly from a cyanobacterium or an early chloroplast, into the nuclear genome of an early plant in a first step, and attached itself to the C terminus of an HD-ZIP IV homeobox gene in a second step. Further position-specific iterated-BLAST searches with the bacterial MEKHLA proteins revealed a subregion within the MEKHLA domain that shares significant similarity with the PAS domain. The PAS domain is a sensory module found in many proteins through all kingdoms of life. It is involved in light, oxygen, and redox potential sensation. The fact that HD-ZIP III proteins are transcription factors that have this sensory domain attached to their C terminus uncovers a potential new signaling pathway in plants.
16607031	A comparative genomics strategy for targeted discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conserved-noncoding sequences in orphan crops.	2006	Plant Physiol	Completed genome sequences provide templates for the design of genome analysis tools in orphan species lacking sequence information. To demonstrate this principle, we designed 384 PCR primer pairs to conserved exonic regions flanking introns, using Sorghum/Pennisetum expressed sequence tag alignments to the Oryza genome. Conserved-intron scanning primers (CISPs) amplified single-copy loci at 37% to 80% success rates in taxa that sample much of the approximately 50-million years of Poaceae divergence. While the conserved nature of exons fostered cross-taxon amplification, the lesser evolutionary constraints on introns enhanced single-nucleotide polymorphism detection. For example, in eight rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes, polymorphism averaged 12.1 per kb in introns but only 3.6 per kb in exons. Curiously, among 124 CISPs evaluated across Oryza, Sorghum, Pennisetum, Cynodon, Eragrostis, Zea, Triticum, and Hordeum, 23 (18.5%) seemed to be subject to rigid intron size constraints that were independent of per-nucleotide DNA sequence variation. Furthermore, we identified 487 conserved-noncoding sequence motifs in 129 CISP loci. A large CISP set (6,062 primer pairs, amplifying introns from 1,676 genes) designed using an automated pipeline showed generally higher abundance in recombinogenic than in nonrecombinogenic regions of the rice genome, thus providing relatively even distribution along genetic maps. CISPs are an effective means to explore poorly characterized genomes for both DNA polymorphism and noncoding sequence conservation on a genome-wide or candidate gene basis, and also provide anchor points for comparative genomics across a diverse range of species.
16500991	Arabidopsis Hsa32, a novel heat shock protein, is essential for acquired thermotolerance during long recovery after acclimation.	2006	Plant Physiol	Plants and animals share similar mechanisms in the heat shock (HS) response, such as synthesis of the conserved HS proteins (Hsps). However, because plants are confined to a growing environment, in general they require unique features to cope with heat stress. Here, we report on the analysis of the function of a novel Hsp, heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein (Hsa32), which is highly conserved in land plants but absent in most other organisms. The gene responds to HS at the transcriptional level in moss (Physcomitrella patens), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa). Like other Hsps, Hsa32 protein accumulates greatly in Arabidopsis seedlings after HS treatment. Disruption of Hsa32 by T-DNA insertion does not affect growth and development under normal conditions. However, the acquired thermotolerance in the knockout line was compromised following a long recovery period (>24 h) after acclimation HS treatment, when a severe HS challenge killed the mutant but not the wild-type plants, but no significant difference was observed if they were challenged within a short recovery period. Quantitative hypocotyl elongation assay also revealed that thermotolerance decayed faster in the absence of Hsa32 after a long recovery. Similar results were obtained in Arabidopsis transgenic plants with Hsa32 expression suppressed by RNA interference. Microarray analysis of the knockout mutant indicates that only the expression of Hsa32 was significantly altered in HS response. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsa32 is required not for induction but rather maintenance of acquired thermotolerance, a feature that could be important to plants.
16461384	Cholic acid, a bile acid elicitor of hypersensitive cell death, pathogenesis-related protein synthesis, and phytoalexin accumulation in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	When plants interact with certain pathogens, they protect themselves by generating various defense responses. These defense responses are induced by molecules called elicitors. Since long ago, composts fermented by animal feces have been used as a fertilizer in plant cultivation, and recently, have been known to provide suppression of plant disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that the compounds from animal feces may function as elicitors of plant defense responses. As a result of examination of our hypothesis, an elicitor of rice defense responses was isolated from human feces, and its structure was identified as cholic acid (CA), a primary bile acid in animals. Treatment of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves with CA induced the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds (phytoalexins), hypersensitive cell death, pathogenesis-related (PR) protein synthesis, and increased resistance to subsequent infection by virulent pathogens. CA induced these defense responses more rapidly than did fungal cerebroside, a sphingolipid elicitor isolated from the rice pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea. Furthermore, fungal cerebroside induced both types of rice phytoalexins, phytocassanes and momilactones, whereas CA mainly induced phytocassanes, but not momilactones. In the structure-activity relationship analysis, the hydroxyl groups at C-7 and C-12, and the carboxyl group at C-24 of CA contributed to the elicitor activity. These results indicate that CA is specifically recognized by rice and is a different type of elicitor from fungal cerebroside. This report demonstrated that bile acid induced defense responses in plants.
16531481	Rice HYDROPEROXIDE LYASES with unique expression patterns generate distinct aldehyde signatures in Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant Physiol	HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) genes encode enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides into aldehydes and oxoacids. There are three HPLs in rice (Oryza sativa), designated OsHPL1 through OsHPL3. To explore the possibility of differential functional activities among these genes, we have examined their expression patterns and biochemical properties of their encoded products. Transcript analysis indicates that these genes have distinct patterns and levels of expression. OsHPL1 is ubiquitously expressed, OsHPL2 is expressed in the leaves and leaf sheaths, whereas OsHPL3 is wound inducible and expressed exclusively in leaves. OsHPLs also differ in their substrate preference as determined by in vitro enzyme assays using 9-/13-hydroperoxy linolenic and 9-/13-hydroperoxy linoleic acids as substrates. OsHPL1 and OsHPL2 metabolize 9-/13-hydroperoxides, whereas OsHPL3 metabolizes 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid exclusively. Sequence alignments of the HPL enzymes have identified signature residues potentially responsible for the substrate specificity/preference of these enzymes. All three OsHPLs are chloroplast localized as determined by chloroplast import assays and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion studies. Aldehyde measurements in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants overexpressing individual OsHPL-GFP fusions indicate that all rice HPLs are functional in a heterologous system, and each of them generates a distinct signature of the metabolites. Interestingly, these aldehydes were only detectable in leaves, but not in roots, despite similar levels of OsHPL-GFP proteins in both tissues. Similarly, there were undetectable levels of aldehydes in rice roots, in spite of the presence of OsHPL1 transcripts. Together, these data suggest that additional tissue-specific mechanism(s) beyond transcript and HPL enzyme abundance, regulate the levels of HPL-derived metabolites.

16531478	Plastid cues posttranscriptionally regulate the accumulation of key enzymes of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant Physiol	Plastid isoprenoids (including hormones and photosynthetic pigments) are essential for plant growth and development, but relatively little is known of how the production of their metabolic precursors via the recently elucidated methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is regulated. We have identified an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant that survives an otherwise lethal block of the MEP pathway with fosmidomycin (FSM). In rif10 (resistant to inhibition with FSM 10) plants, the accumulation of flux-controlling enzymes of the pathway is posttranscriptionally up-regulated. Strikingly, this phenotype is linked to a lower accumulation of plastidial isoprenoid pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids, resulting in mutant plants that are paler and smaller than the wild type. The rif10 mutant is impaired in plastid RNA processing due to a T-DNA insertion in the coding region of the At3g03710 gene encoding the chloroplast-targeted exoribonuclease polyribonucleotide phosphorylase. FSM resistance and other rif10-like phenotypes were also observed in wild-type Arabidopsis, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings grown in the presence of sublethal concentrations of chloramphenicol (an inhibitor of protein synthesis in plastids). By contrast, treatment with norflurazon (an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis causing a similar pale cotyledon phenotype) did not result in FSM resistance. Together, the results support that plastome-encoded proteins are involved in negatively regulating the posttranscriptional accumulation of specific nuclear-encoded MEP pathway enzymes in chloroplasts. Regulation of the MEP pathway by a mechanism dependent on plastid cues might function under physiological conditions to finely adjust plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis to the metabolic capabilities or requirements of plastids.

16632592	The intracellular fate of a recombinant protein is tissue dependent.	2006	Plant Physiol	Recombinant proteins directed to the secretory pathway in plants require a signal peptide for entry into the endoplasmic reticulum. In the absence of further targeting information, such proteins are generally secreted via the default pathway to the apoplast. This has been well documented in protoplasts and leaf tissue, but the trafficking of recombinant proteins in seeds and other storage tissues has rarely been investigated. We used Aspergillus niger phytase as a model glycoprotein to compare the intracellular fate of a recombinant protein in the leaves and seeds of rice (Oryza sativa). Using fluorescence and electron microscopy we showed that the recombinant protein was efficiently secreted from leaf cells as expected. In contrast, within endosperm cells it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum-derived prolamin bodies and protein storage vacuoles. Consistent with our immunolocalization data, the phytase produced in endosperm cells possessed oligomannose and vacuolar-type N-glycans [Man(3)(Xyl)(Fuc)GlcNAc(2)], whereas the phytase produced in leaves contained predominantly secretion-type N-glycans [GlcNAc(2)Man(3)(Xyl)(Fuc)GlcNAc(2)]. The latter could not be detected in preparations of the endosperm-derived phytase. Our results show that the intracellular deposition and modification of a recombinant protein is tissue dependent.
16679424	PHO2, microRNA399, and PHR1 define a phosphate-signaling pathway in plants.	2006	Plant Physiol	Inorganic phosphate (Pi)-signaling pathways in plants are still largely unknown. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pho2 mutant overaccumulates Pi in leaves in Pi-replete conditions. Micrografting revealed that a pho2 root genotype is sufficient to yield leaf Pi accumulation. In pho2 mutants, Pi does not repress a set of Pi starvation-induced genes, including AtIPS1, AT4, and Pi transporters Pht1;8 and Pht1;9. Map-based cloning identified PHO2 as At2g33770, an unusual E2 conjugase gene. It was recently shown that Pi deprivation induces mature microRNA (miRNA [miR399]) and that overexpression of miR399 in Pi-replete conditions represses E2 conjugase expression and leads to high leaf Pi concentrations, thus phenocopying pho2. We show here that miR399 primary transcripts are also strongly induced by low Pi and rapidly repressed after addition of Pi. PHO2 transcripts change reciprocally to miR399 transcripts in Pi-deprived plants and in miR399 overexpressers. However, responses after Pi readdition and in beta-glucuronidase reporter lines suggest that PHO2 expression is also regulated by Pi in a manner unrelated to miR399-mediated transcript cleavage. Expression of miR399 was strongly reduced in Pi-deprived Arabidopsis phr1 mutants, and a subset of Pi-responsive genes repressed in Pi-deprived phr1 mutants was up-regulated in Pi-replete pho2 mutants. This places miR399 and PHO2 in a branch of the Pi-signaling network downstream of PHR1. Finally, putative PHO2 orthologs containing five miR399-binding sites in their 5'-untranslated regions were identified in other higher plants, and Pi-dependent miR399 expression was demonstrated in rice (Oryza sativa), suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism.
16896230	Genome-wide analysis of basic/helix-loop-helix transcription factor family in rice and Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant Physiol	The basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and their homologs form a large family in plant and animal genomes. They are known to play important roles in the specification of tissue types in animals. On the other hand, few plant bHLH proteins have been studied functionally. Recent completion of whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) allows genome-wide analysis and comparison of the bHLH family in flowering plants. We have identified 167 bHLH genes in the rice genome, and their phylogenetic analysis indicates that they form well-supported clades, which are defined as subfamilies. In addition, sequence analysis of potential DNA-binding activity, the sequence motifs outside the bHLH domain, and the conservation of intron/exon structural patterns further support the evolutionary relationships among these proteins. The genome distribution of rice bHLH genes strongly supports the hypothesis that genome-wide and tandem duplication contributed to the expansion of the bHLH gene family, consistent with the birth-and-death theory of gene family evolution. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that rice bHLH proteins can potentially participate in a variety of combinatorial interactions, endowing them with the capacity to regulate a multitude of transcriptional programs. In addition, similar expression patterns suggest functional conservation between some rice bHLH genes and their close Arabidopsis homologs.
16861570	RNA interference-based gene silencing as an efficient tool for functional genomics in hexaploid bread wheat.	2006	Plant Physiol	Insertional mutagenesis and gene silencing are efficient tools for the determination of gene function. In contrast to gain- or loss-of-function approaches, RNA interference (RNAi)-induced gene silencing can possibly silence multigene families and homoeologous genes in polyploids. This is of great importance for functional studies in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), where most of the genes are present in at least three homoeologous copies and conventional insertional mutagenesis is not effective. We have introduced into bread wheat double-stranded RNA-expressing constructs containing fragments of genes encoding Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) or the signal transducer of ethylene, Ethylene Insensitive 2 (EIN2). Transformed plants showed phenotypic changes that were stably inherited over at least two generations. These changes were very similar to mutant phenotypes of the two genes in diploid model plants. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a good correlation between decreasing mRNA levels and increasingly severe phenotypes. RNAi silencing had the same quantitative effect on all three homoeologous genes. The most severe phenotypes were observed in homozygous plants that showed the strongest mRNA reduction and, interestingly, produced around 2-fold the amount of small RNAs compared to heterozygous plants. This suggests that the effect of RNAi in hexaploid wheat is gene-dosage dependent. Wheat seedlings with low mRNA levels for EIN2 were ethylene insensitive. Thus, EIN2 is a positive regulator of the ethylene-signaling pathway in wheat, very similar to its homologs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Our data show that RNAi results in stably inherited phenotypes and therefore represents an efficient tool for functional genomic studies in polyploid wheat.
16844829	The Medicago truncatula lysin [corrected] motif-receptor-like kinase gene family includes NFP and new nodule-expressed genes.	2006	Plant Physiol	Rhizobial Nod factors are key symbiotic signals responsible for starting the nodulation process in host legume plants. Of the six Medicago truncatula genes controlling a Nod factor signaling pathway, Nod Factor Perception (NFP) was reported as a candidate Nod factor receptor gene. Here, we provide further evidence for this by showing that NFP is a lysin [corrected] motif (LysM)-receptor-like kinase (RLK). NFP was shown both to be expressed in association with infection thread development and to be involved in the infection process. Consistent with deviations from conserved kinase domain sequences, NFP did not show autophosphorylation activity, suggesting that NFP needs to associate with an active kinase or has unusual functional characteristics different from classical kinases. Identification of nine new M. truncatula LysM-RLK genes revealed a larger family than in the nonlegumes Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) or rice (Oryza sativa) of at least 17 members that can be divided into three subfamilies. Three LysM domains could be structurally predicted for all M. truncatula LysM-RLK proteins, whereas one subfamily, which includes NFP, was characterized by deviations from conserved kinase sequences. Most of the newly identified genes were found to be expressed in roots and nodules, suggesting this class of receptors may be more extensively involved in nodulation than was previously known.
16891544	Whole-genome analysis of Oryza sativa reveals similar architecture of two-component signaling machinery with Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant Physiol	The two-component system (TCS), which works on the principle of histidine-aspartate phosphorelay signaling, is known to play an important role in diverse physiological processes in lower organisms and has recently emerged as an important signaling system in plants. Employing the tools of bioinformatics, we have characterized TCS signaling candidate genes in the genome of Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica. We present a complete overview of TCS gene families in O. sativa, including gene structures, conserved motifs, chromosome locations, and phylogeny. Our analysis indicates a total of 51 genes encoding 73 putative TCS proteins. Fourteen genes encode 22 putative histidine kinases with a conserved histidine and other typical histidine kinase signature sequences, five phosphotransfer genes encoding seven phosphotransfer proteins, and 32 response regulator genes encoding 44 proteins. The variations seen between gene and protein numbers are assumed to result from alternative splicing. These putative proteins have high homology with TCS members that have been shown experimentally to participate in several important physiological phenomena in plants, such as ethylene and cytokinin signaling and phytochrome-mediated responses to light. We conclude that the overall architecture of the TCS machinery in O. sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana is similar, and our analysis provides insights into the conservation and divergence of this important signaling machinery in higher plants.
16905665	Whole-plant growth stage ontology for angiosperms and its application in plant biology.	2006	Plant Physiol	Plant growth stages are identified as distinct morphological landmarks in a continuous developmental process. The terms describing these developmental stages record the morphological appearance of the plant at a specific point in its life cycle. The widely differing morphology of plant species consequently gave rise to heterogeneous vocabularies describing growth and development. Each species or family specific community developed distinct terminologies for describing whole-plant growth stages. This semantic heterogeneity made it impossible to use growth stage description contained within plant biology databases to make meaningful computational comparisons. The Plant Ontology Consortium (http://www.plantontology.org) was founded to develop standard ontologies describing plant anatomical as well as growth and developmental stages that can be used for annotation of gene expression patterns and phenotypes of all flowering plants. In this article, we describe the development of a generic whole-plant growth stage ontology that describes the spatiotemporal stages of plant growth as a set of landmark events that progress from germination to senescence. This ontology represents a synthesis and integration of terms and concepts from a variety of species-specific vocabularies previously used for describing phenotypes and genomic information. It provides a common platform for annotating gene function and gene expression in relation to the developmental trajectory of a plant described at the organismal level. As proof of concept the Plant Ontology Consortium used the plant ontology growth stage ontology to annotate genes and phenotypes in plants with initial emphasis on those represented in The Arabidopsis Information Resource, Gramene database, and MaizeGDB.
16920874	Computational estimation and experimental verification of off-target silencing during posttranscriptional gene silencing in plants.	2006	Plant Physiol	Successful application of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) for gene function study in both plants and animals depends on high target specificity and silencing efficiency. By computational analysis with genome and/or transcriptome sequences of 25 plant species, we predicted that about 50% to 70% of gene transcripts in plants have potential off-targets when used for PTGS that could obscure experimental results. We have developed a publicly available Web-based computational tool called siRNA Scan to identify potential off-targets during PTGS. Some of the potential off-targets obtained from this tool were tested by measuring the amount of off-target transcripts using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Up to 50% of the predicted off-target genes tested in plants were actually silenced when tested experimentally. Our results suggest that a high risk of off-target gene silencing exists during PTGS in plants. Our siRNA Scan tool is useful to design better constructs for PTGS by minimizing off-target gene silencing in both plants and animals.
16920880	Gibberellin mobilizes distinct DELLA-dependent transcriptomes to regulate seed germination and floral development in Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant Physiol	Severe Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gibberellin (GA)-deficient mutant ga1-3 fails to germinate and is impaired in floral organ development. In contrast, the ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1 mutant confers GA-independent seed germination and floral development. This fact suggests that GA-regulated transcriptomes for seed germination and floral development are DELLA dependent. However, it is currently not known if all GA-regulated genes are GA regulated in a DELLA-dependent fashion and if a similar set of DELLA-regulated genes is mobilized to repress both seed germination and floral development. Here, we compared the global gene expression patterns in the imbibed seeds and unopened flower buds of the ga1-3 mutant with that of the wild type and of the ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1 mutant. We found that about one-half of total GA-regulated genes are apparently regulated in a DELLA-dependent fashion, suggesting that there might be a DELLA-independent or -partially-dependent component of GA-dependent gene regulation. A cross-comparison based on gene identity revealed that the GA-regulated DELLA-dependent transcriptomes in the imbibed seeds and flower buds are distinct from each other. Detailed ontology analysis showed that, on one hand, DELLAs differentially regulate the expression of different individual members of a gene family to run similar biochemical pathways in seeds and flower. Meanwhile, DELLAs control many functionally different genes to run specific pathways in seeds or flower buds to mark the two different developmental processes. Our data shown here not only confirm many previous reports but also single out some novel aspects of DELLA functions that are instructive to our future research.
16905666	Effects of zinc deficiency on rice growth and genetic factors contributing to tolerance.	2006	Plant Physiol	Zinc (Zn) deficiency is the most widespread micronutrient disorder in rice (Oryza sativa), but efforts to develop cultivars with improved tolerance have been hampered by insufficient understanding of genetic factors contributing to tolerance. The objective of this paper was to examine alternative evaluation methods and to identify the most informative traits that would provide realistic information for rice breeders and to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with tolerance. Screening experiments in low-Zn nutrient solution and in a Zn-deficient field did not produce similar tolerance rankings in a set of segregating lines, which suggested that rhizosphere effects were of greater importance for lowland rice than internal Zn efficiency. The most severe symptom in the field was high plant mortality. The occurrence of leaf bronzing, usually regarded as indicative of susceptibility, did not necessarily concur with high plant mortality, which implied that both were under independent genetic control. The QTL mapping experiment conducted in the field with a population derived from a cross of IR74 (intolerant) with Jalmagna (tolerant) largely confirmed this. Four QTLs associated with plant mortality were detected, and only one of those colocalized with one of the four QTLs detected for leaf bronzing. The two most influential QTLs for plant mortality were detected on chromosomes 2 and 12. They explained 16.6% and 24.2% of the variation, and alleles of the tolerant donor parent Jalmagna reduced mortality by 16.6% and 14.8%, respectively. QTLs for plant mortality acted in a purely additive manner, whereas digenic epistatic interactions were important for leaf bronzing.
17012406	The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Kip-related proteins (KRPs) play a major role in the regulation of the plant cell cycle. We report the identification of five putative rice (Oryza sativa) proteins that share characteristic motifs with previously described plant KRPs. To investigate the function of KRPs in rice development, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the Orysa;KRP1 gene. Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development. The reduced cell production in the leaf meristem was partly compensated by an increased cell size, demonstrating the existence of a compensatory mechanism in monocot species by which growth rate is less reduced than cell production, through cell expansion. Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling. Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells. The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development. Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation.
16998090	Functional classification, genomic organization, putatively cis-acting regulatory elements, and relationship to quantitative trait loci, of sorghum genes with rhizome-enriched expression.	2006	Plant Physiol	Rhizomes are organs of fundamental importance to plant competitiveness and invasiveness. We have identified genes expressed at substantially higher levels in rhizomes than other plant parts, and explored their functional categorization, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and association with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring rhizomatousness. The finding that genes with rhizome-enriched expression are distributed across a wide range of functional categories suggests some degree of specialization of individual members of many gene families in rhizomatous plants. A disproportionate share of genes with rhizome-enriched expression was implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism, and abiotic stimuli and development. A high frequency of unknown-function genes reflects our still limited knowledge of this plant organ. A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high (but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes. From cDNA clones showing rhizome-enriched expression, expressed sequence tags forming 455 contigs were plotted on the rice genome and aligned to QTL likelihood intervals for ratooning and rhizomatous traits in rice and sorghum. Highly expressed rhizome genes were somewhat enriched in QTL likelihood intervals for rhizomatousness or ratooning, with specific candidates including some of the most rhizome-specific genes. Some rhizomatousness and ratooning QTLs were shown to be potentially related to one another as a result of ancient duplication, suggesting long-term functional conservation of the underlying genes. Insight into genes and pathways that influence rhizome growth set the stage for genetic and/or exogenous manipulation of rhizomatousness, and for further dissection of the molecular evolution of rhizomatousness.
17012402	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants.	2006	Plant Physiol	The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.
16980566	Divergence of the Dof gene families in poplar, Arabidopsis, and rice suggests multiple modes of gene evolution after duplication.	2006	Plant Physiol	It is widely accepted that gene duplication is a primary source of genetic novelty. However, the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes remains largely unresolved. The classical Ohno's Duplication-Retention-Non/Neofunctionalization theory, and the recently proposed alternatives such as subfunctionalization or duplication-degeneration-complementation, and subneofunctionalization, each can explain one or more aspects of gene fate after duplication. Duplicated genes are also affected by epigenetic changes. We constructed a phylogenetic tree using Dof (DNA binding with one finger) protein sequences from poplar (Populus trichocarpa) Torr. & Gray ex Brayshaw, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa). From the phylogenetic tree, we identified 27 pairs of paralogous Dof genes in the terminal nodes. Analysis of protein motif structure of the Dof paralogs and their ancestors revealed six different gene fates after gene duplication. Differential protein methylation was revealed between a pair of duplicated poplar Dof genes, which have identical motif structure and similar expression pattern, indicating that epigenetics is involved in evolution. Analysis of reverse transcription-PCR, massively parallel signature sequencing, and microarray data revealed that the paralogs differ in expression pattern. Furthermore, analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates indicated that divergence of the duplicated genes was driven by positive selection. About one-half of the motifs in Dof proteins were shared by non-Dof proteins in the three plants species, indicating that motif co-option may be one of the forces driving gene diversification. We provided evidence that the Ohno's Duplication-Retention-Non/Neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization/duplication-degeneration-complementation, and subneofunctionalization hypotheses are complementary with, not alternative to, each other.
16998087	The Arabidopsis unannotated secreted peptide database, a resource for plant peptidomics.	2006	Plant Physiol	In the era of genomics, if a gene is not annotated, it is not investigated. Due to their small size, genes encoding peptides are often missed in genome annotations. Secreted peptides are important regulators of plant growth, development, and physiology. Identification of additional peptide signals by sequence homology searches has had limited success due to sequence heterogeneity. A bioinformatics approach was taken to find unannotated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) peptides. Arabidopsis chromosome sequences were searched for all open reading frames (ORFs) encoding peptides and small proteins between 25 and 250 amino acids in length. The translated ORFs were then sequentially queried for the presence of an amino-terminal cleavable signal peptide, the absence of transmembrane domains, and the absence of endoplasmic reticulum lumenal retention sequences. Next, the ORFs were filtered against the The Arabidopsis Information Resource 6.0 annotated Arabidopsis genes to remove those ORFs overlapping known genes. The remaining 33,809 ORFs were placed in a relational database to which additional annotation data were deposited. Genome-wide tiling array data were compared with the coordinates of the ORFs, supporting the possibility that many of the ORFs may be expressed. In addition, clustering and sequence similarity analyses revealed that many of the putative peptides are in gene families and/or appear to be present in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. A subset of the ORFs was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and, for one-fifth of those, expression was detected. These results support the idea that the number and diversity of plant peptides is broader than currently assumed. The peptides identified and their annotation data may be viewed or downloaded through a searchable Web interface at peptidome.missouri.edu.
16980567	Localization of green fluorescent protein fusions with the seven Arabidopsis vacuolar sorting receptors to prevacuolar compartments in tobacco BY-2 cells.	2006	Plant Physiol	We have previously demonstrated that vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) proteins are concentrated on prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) in plant cells. PVCs in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells are multivesicular bodies (MVBs) as defined by VSR proteins and the BP-80 reporter, where the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) sequences of BP-80 are sufficient and specific for correct targeting of the reporter to PVCs. The genome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains seven VSR proteins, but little is known about their individual subcellular localization and function. Here, we study the subcellular localization of the seven Arabidopsis VSR proteins (AtVSR1-7) based on the previously proven hypothesis that the TMD and CT sequences correctly target individual VSR to its final destination in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells. Toward this goal, we have generated seven chimeric constructs containing signal peptide (sp) linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and TMD/CT sequences (sp-GFP-TMD/CT) of the seven individual AtVSR. Transgenic tobacco BY-2 cell lines expressing these seven sp-GFP-TMD-CT fusions all exhibited typical punctate signals colocalizing with VSR proteins by confocal immunofluorescence. In addition, wortmannin caused the GFP-marked prevacuolar organelles to form small vacuoles, and VSR antibodies labeled these enlarged MVBs in transgenic BY-2 cells. Wortmannin also caused VSR-marked PVCs to vacuolate in other cell types, including Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa), pea (Pisum sativum), and mung bean (Vigna radiata). Therefore, the seven AtVSRs are localized to MVBs in tobacco BY-2 cells, and wortmannin-induced vacuolation of PVCs is a general response in plants.
17041027	Geminivirus infection up-regulates the expression of two Arabidopsis protein kinases related to yeast SNF1- and mammalian AMPK-activating kinases.	2006	Plant Physiol	Geminivirus Rep-interacting kinase 1 (GRIK1) and GRIK2 constitute a small protein kinase family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). An earlier study showed that a truncated version of GRIK1 binds to the geminivirus replication protein AL1. We show here both full-length GRIK1 and GRIK2 interact with AL1 in yeast two-hybrid studies. Using specific antibodies, we showed that both Arabidopsis kinases are elevated in infected leaves. Immunoblot analysis of healthy plants revealed that GRIK1 and GRIK2 are highest in young leaf and floral tissues and low or undetectable in mature tissues. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the kinases accumulate in the shoot apical meristem, leaf primordium, and emerging petiole. Unlike the protein patterns, GRIK1 and GRIK2 transcript levels only show a small increase during infection and do not change significantly during development. Treating healthy seedlings and infected leaves with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in higher GRIK1 and GRIK2 protein levels, whereas treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide reduced both kinases, demonstrating that their accumulation is modulated by posttranscriptional processes. Phylogenetic comparisons indicated that GRIK1, GRIK2, and related kinases from Medicago truncatula and rice (Oryza sativa) are most similar to the yeast kinases PAK1, TOS3, and ELM1 and the mammalian kinase CaMKK, which activate the yeast kinase SNF1 and its mammalian homolog AMPK, respectively. Complementation studies using a PAK1/TOS3/ELM1 triple mutant showed that GRIK1 and GRIK2 can functionally replace the yeast kinases, suggesting that the Arabidopsis kinases mediate one or more processes during early plant development and geminivirus infection by activating SNF1-related kinases.
17071645	A sodium transporter (HKT7) is a candidate for Nax1, a gene for salt tolerance in durum wheat.	2006	Plant Physiol	Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) is more salt sensitive than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). A novel source of Na(+) exclusion conferring salt tolerance to durum wheat is present in the durum wheat Line 149 derived from Triticum monococcum C68-101, and a quantitative trait locus contributing to low Na(+) concentration in leaf blades, Nax1, mapped to chromosome 2AL. In this study, we used the rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequence and data from the wheat expressed sequence tag deletion bin mapping project to identify markers and construct a high-resolution map of the Nax1 region. Genes on wheat chromosome 2AL and rice chromosome 4L had good overall colinearity, but there was an inversion of a chromosomal segment that includes the Nax1 locus. Two putative sodium transporter genes (TmHKT7) related to OsHKT7 were mapped to chromosome 2AL. One TmHKT7 member (TmHKT7-A1) was polymorphic between the salt-tolerant and -sensitive lines, and cosegregated with Nax1 in the high-resolution mapping family. The other TmHKT7 member (TmHKT7-A2) was located within the same bacterial artificial chromosome contig of approximately 145 kb as TmHKT7-A1. TmHKT7-A1 and -A2 showed 83% amino acid identity. TmHKT7-A2, but not TmHKT7-A1, was expressed in roots and leaf sheaths of the salt-tolerant durum wheat Line 149. The expression pattern of TmHKT7-A2 was consistent with the physiological role of Nax1 in reducing Na(+) concentration in leaf blades by retaining Na(+) in the sheaths. TmHKT7-A2 could control Na(+) unloading from xylem in roots and sheaths.
17098858	Combining expression and comparative evolutionary analysis. The COBRA gene family.	2007	Plant Physiol	Plant cell shape is achieved through a combination of oriented cell division and cell expansion and is defined by the cell wall. One of the genes identified to influence cell expansion in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root is the COBRA (COB) gene that belongs to a multigene family. Three members of the AtCOB gene family have been shown to play a role in specific types of cell expansion or cell wall biosynthesis. Functional orthologs of one of these genes have been identified in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa; Schindelman et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2005; Persson et al., 2005; Ching et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2006). We present the maize counterpart of the COB gene family and the COB gene superfamily phylogeny. Most of the genes belong to a family with two main clades as previously identified by analysis of the Arabidopsis family alone. Within these clades, however, clear differences between monocot and eudicot family members exist, and these are analyzed in the context of Type I and Type II cell walls in eudicots and monocots. In addition to changes at the sequence level, gene regulation of this family in a eudicot, Arabidopsis, and a monocot, maize, is also characterized. Gene expression is analyzed in a multivariate approach, using data from a number of sources, including massively parallel signature sequencing libraries, transcriptional reporter fusions, and microarray data. This analysis has revealed that the expression of Arabidopsis and maize COB gene family members is highly developmentally and spatially regulated at the tissue and cell type-specific level, that gene superfamily members show overlapping and unique expression patterns, and that only a subset of gene superfamily members act in response to environmental stimuli. Regulation of expression of the Arabidopsis COB gene family members has highly diversified in comparison to that of the maize COB gene superfamily members. We also identify BRITTLE STALK 2-LIKE 3 as a putative ortholog of AtCOB.
17098851	Characterization of the preprotein and amino acid transporter gene family in Arabidopsis.	2007	Plant Physiol	Seventeen loci encode proteins of the preprotein and amino acid transporter family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Some of these genes have arisen from recent duplications and are not in annotated duplicated regions of the Arabidopsis genome. In comparison to a number of other eukaryotic organisms, this family of proteins has greatly expanded in plants, with 24 loci in rice (Oryza sativa). Most of the Arabidopsis and rice genes are orthologous, indicating expansion of this family before monocot and dicot divergence. In vitro protein uptake assays, in vivo green fluorescent protein tagging, and immunological analyses of selected proteins determined either mitochondrial or plastidic localization for 10 and six proteins, respectively. The protein encoded by At5g24650 is targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts and, to our knowledge, is the first membrane protein reported to be targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. Three genes encoded translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM)17-like proteins, three TIM23-like proteins, and three outer envelope protein16-like proteins in Arabidopsis. The identity of Arabidopsis TIM22-like proteins is most likely a protein encoded by At3g10110/At1g18320, based on phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization, and complementation of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant and coexpression analysis. The lack of a preprotein and amino acid transporter domain in some proteins, localization in mitochondria, plastids, or both, variation in gene structure, and the differences in expression profiles indicate that the function of this family has diverged in plants beyond roles in protein translocation.
17098850	Germanium-68 as an adequate tracer for silicon transport in plants. Characterization of silicon uptake in different crop species.	2007	Plant Physiol	A basic problem in silicon (Si) uptake studies in biology is the lack of an appropriate radioactive isotope. Radioactive germanium-68 ((68)Ge) has been used previously as a Si tracer in biological materials, but its suitability for the study of Si transport in higher plants is still untested. In this study, we investigated (68)Ge-traced Si uptake by four crop species differing widely in uptake capacity for Si, including rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Maintenance of a (68)Ge:Si molar ratio that was similar in the plant tissues of all four plant species to that supplied in the nutrient solution over a wide range of Si concentrations demonstrated the absence of discrimination between (68)Ge and Si. Further, using the (68)Ge tracer, a typical Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics for Si was found in rice, barley, and cucumber. Compared to rice, the relative proportion of root-to-shoot translocated Si was lower in barley and cucumber and especially in tomato (only 30%). Uptake and translocation of Si in rice, barley, and cucumber (Si accumulators) were strongly inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol and HgCl(2), but in tomato, as a Si-excluding species, both inhibitors produced the opposite effect. In conclusion, our results suggest the use of the (68)Ge tracer method as an appropriate choice for future studies of Si transport in plants. Our findings also indicate that the restriction of Si from symplast to apoplast in the cortex of Si excluders is a metabolically active process.
17259261	SDG714, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, is involved in Tos17 DNA methylation and transposition in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	Although the role of H3K9 methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear, in Arabidopsis thaliana the loss of histone H3K9 methylation by mutation of Kryptonite [also known as SU(VAR)3-9 homolog] reduces genome-wide DNA methylation and increases the transcription of transposable elements. Here, we report that rice SDG714 (for SET Domain Group Protein714) encodes a histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase. The C terminus of SDG714 confers enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, whereas the N terminus localizes it in the nucleus. Loss-of-function mutants of SDG714 (SDG714IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants. These mutants also show decreased levels of CpG and CNG cytosine methylation as well as H3K9 methylation at the Tos17 locus, a copia-like retrotransposon widely used for the generation of rice mutants. Most interestingly, loss of function of SDG714 can enhance transcription and cause the transposition of Tos17. Together, these results suggest that histone H3K9 methylation mediated by SDG714 is involved in DNA methylation, the transposition of transposable elements, and genome stability in rice.
17322409	Roles for rice membrane dynamics and plasmodesmata during biotrophic invasion by the blast fungus.	2007	Plant Cell	Rice blast disease is caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which invades living plant cells using intracellular invasive hyphae (IH) that grow from one cell to the next. The cellular and molecular processes by which this occurs are not understood. We applied live-cell imaging to characterize the spatial and temporal development of IH and plant responses inside successively invaded rice (Oryza sativa) cells. Loading experiments with the endocytotic tracker FM4-64 showed dynamic plant membranes around IH. IH were sealed in a plant membrane, termed the extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM), which showed multiple connections to peripheral rice cell membranes. The IH switched between pseudohyphal and filamentous growth. Successive cell invasions were biotrophic, although each invaded cell appeared to have lost viability when the fungus moved into adjacent cells. EIHM formed distinct membrane caps at the tips of IH that initially grew in neighboring cells. Time-lapse imaging showed IH scanning plant cell walls before crossing, and transmission electron microscopy showed IH preferentially contacting or crossing cell walls at pit fields. This and additional evidence strongly suggest that IH co-opt plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell movement. Analysis of biotrophic blast invasion will significantly contribute to our understanding of normal plant processes and allow the characterization of secreted fungal effectors that affect these processes.
16384901	Transgenic tobacco overexpressing glyoxalase pathway enzymes grow and set viable seeds in zinc-spiked soils.	2006	Plant Physiol	We reported earlier that engineering of the glyoxalase pathway (a two-step reaction mediated through glyoxalase I and II enzymes) enhances salinity tolerance. Here we report the extended suitability of this engineering strategy for improved heavy-metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The glyoxalase transgenics were able to grow, flower, and set normal viable seeds in the presence of 5 mm ZnCl2 without any yield penalty. The endogenous ion content measurements revealed roots to be the major sink for excess zinc accumulation, with negligible amounts in seeds in transgenic plants. Preliminary observations suggest that glyoxalase overexpression could confer tolerance to other heavy metals, such as cadmium or lead. Comparison of relative tolerance capacities of transgenic plants, overexpressing either glyoxalase I or II individually or together in double transgenics, evaluated in terms of various critical parameters such as survival, growth, and yield, reflected double transgenics to perform better than either of the single-gene transformants. Biochemical investigations indicated restricted methylglyoxal accumulation and less lipid peroxidation under high zinc conditions in transgenic plants. Studies employing the glutathione biosynthetic inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, suggested an increase in the level of phytochelatins and maintenance of glutathione homeostasis in transgenic plants during exposure to excess zinc as the possible mechanism behind this tolerance. Together, these findings presents a novel strategy to develop multiple stress tolerance via glyoxalase pathway engineering, thus implicating its potential use in engineering agriculturally important crop plants to grow on rapidly deteriorating lands with multiple unfavorable edaphic factors.
17142475	The plant structure ontology, a unified vocabulary of anatomy and morphology of a flowering plant.	2007	Plant Physiol	Formal description of plant phenotypes and standardized annotation of gene expression and protein localization data require uniform terminology that accurately describes plant anatomy and morphology. This facilitates cross species comparative studies and quantitative comparison of phenotypes and expression patterns. A major drawback is variable terminology that is used to describe plant anatomy and morphology in publications and genomic databases for different species. The same terms are sometimes applied to different plant structures in different taxonomic groups. Conversely, similar structures are named by their species-specific terms. To address this problem, we created the Plant Structure Ontology (PSO), the first generic ontological representation of anatomy and morphology of a flowering plant. The PSO is intended for a broad plant research community, including bench scientists, curators in genomic databases, and bioinformaticians. The initial releases of the PSO integrated existing ontologies for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), maize (Zea mays), and rice (Oryza sativa); more recent versions of the ontology encompass terms relevant to Fabaceae, Solanaceae, additional cereal crops, and poplar (Populus spp.). Databases such as The Arabidopsis Information Resource, Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre, Gramene, MaizeGDB, and SOL Genomics Network are using the PSO to describe expression patterns of genes and phenotypes of mutants and natural variants and are regularly contributing new annotations to the Plant Ontology database. The PSO is also used in specialized public databases, such as BRENDA, GENEVESTIGATOR, NASCArrays, and others. Over 10,000 gene annotations and phenotype descriptions from participating databases can be queried and retrieved using the Plant Ontology browser. The PSO, as well as contributed gene associations, can be obtained at www.plantontology.org.
17259288	OsCSLD1, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Root hairs are long tubular outgrowths that form on the surface of specialized epidermal cells. They are required for nutrient and water uptake and interact with the soil microflora. Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs. In these mutants, while hair development is initiated normally, the hairs elongate less than the wild-type hairs and they have kinks and swellings along their length. Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation. Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells. Furthermore, OsCSLD1 is the only member of the four rice CSLD genes that shows root-specific expression. Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins. Thus, at least part of the mechanism of root hair morphogenesis in Arabidopsis is conserved in rice.
17220362	Recent proliferation and translocation of pollen group 1 allergen genes in the maize genome.	2007	Plant Physiol	The dominant allergenic components of grass pollen are known by immunologists as group 1 allergens. These constitute a set of closely related proteins from the beta-expansin family and have been shown to have cell wall-loosening activity. Group 1 allergens may facilitate the penetration of pollen tubes through the grass stigma and style. In maize (Zea mays), group 1 allergens are divided into two classes, A and B. We have identified 15 genes encoding group 1 allergens in maize, 11 genes in class A and four genes in class B, as well as seven pseudogenes. The genes in class A can be divided by sequence relatedness into two complexes, whereas the genes in class B constitute a single complex. Most of the genes identified are represented in pollen-specific expressed sequence tag libraries and are under purifying selection, despite the presence of multiple copies that are nearly identical. Group 1 allergen genes are clustered in at least six different genomic locations. The single class B location and one of the class A locations show synteny with the rice (Oryza sativa) regions where orthologous genes are found. Both classes are expressed at high levels in mature pollen but at low levels in immature flowers. The set of genes encoding maize group 1 allergens is more complex than originally anticipated. If this situation is common in grasses, it may account for the large number of protein variants, or group 1 isoallergens, identified previously in turf grass pollen by immunologists.
17259286	Spatial distribution and temporal variation of the rice silicon transporter Lsi1.	2007	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a typical silicon (Si) accumulator and requires a large amount of Si for high-yield production. Recently, a gene (Low silicon rice1 [Lsi1]) encoding a Si transporter was identified in rice roots. Here, we characterized Lsi1 in terms of spatial distribution and temporal variation using both physiological and molecular approaches. Results from a multicompartment transport box experiment showed that the major site for Si uptake was located at the basal zone (>10 mm from the root tip) of the roots rather than at the root tips (<10 mm from the root tip). Consistent with the Si uptake pattern, Lsi1 expression and distribution of the Lsi1 protein were found only in the basal zone of roots. In the basal zones of the seminal, crown, and lateral roots, the Lsi1 protein showed a polar localization at the distal side of both the exodermis and endodermis, where the Casparian bands are formed. This indicates that Lsi1 is required for the transport of Si through the cells of the exodermis and endodermis. Expression of Lsi1 displayed a distinct diurnal pattern. Furthermore, expression was transiently enhanced around the heading stage, which coincides with a high Si requirement during this growth stage. Expression was down-regulated by dehydration stress and abscisic acid, suggesting that expression of Lsi1 may be regulated by abscisic acid.
17220367	Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA genes in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the predominant auxin in plants, plays a critical role in various plant growth and developmental processes, its biosynthesis and regulation have not been clearly elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of IAA synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified seven YUCCA-like genes (named OsYUCCA1-7) in the rice genome. Plants overexpressing OsYUCCA1 exhibited increased IAA levels and characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes, whereas plants expressing antisense OsYUCCA1 cDNA displayed defects that are similar to those of rice auxin-insensitive mutants. OsYUCCA1 was expressed in almost all of the organs tested, but its expression was restricted to discrete areas, including the tips of leaves, roots, and vascular tissues, where it overlapped with expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene controlled by the auxin-responsive DR5 promoter. These observations are consistent with an important role for the rice enzyme OsYUCCA1 in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan-dependent pathway.
17293439	F-box proteins in rice. Genome-wide analysis, classification, temporal and spatial gene expression during panicle and seed development, and regulation by light and abiotic stress.	2007	Plant Physiol	F-box proteins constitute a large family in eukaryotes and are characterized by a conserved F-box motif (approximately 40 amino acids). As components of the Skp1p-cullin-F-box complex, F-box proteins are critical for the controlled degradation of cellular proteins. We have identified 687 potential F-box proteins in rice (Oryza sativa), the model monocotyledonous plant, by a reiterative database search. Computational analysis revealed the presence of several other functional domains, including leucine-rich repeats, kelch repeats, F-box associated domain, domain of unknown function, and tubby domain in F-box proteins. Based upon their domain composition, they have been classified into 10 subfamilies. Several putative novel conserved motifs have been identified in F-box proteins, which do not contain any other known functional domain. An analysis of a complete set of F-box proteins in rice is presented, including classification, chromosomal location, conserved motifs, and phylogenetic relationship. It appears that the expansion of F-box family in rice, in large part, might have occurred due to localized gene duplications. Furthermore, comprehensive digital expression analysis of F-box protein-encoding genes has been complemented with microarray analysis. The results reveal specific and/or overlapping expression of rice F-box protein-encoding genes during floral transition as well as panicle and seed development. At least 43 F-box protein-encoding genes have been found to be differentially expressed in rice seedlings subjected to different abiotic stress conditions. The expression of several F-box protein-encoding genes is also influenced by light. The structure and function of F-box proteins in plants is discussed in light of these results and the published information. These data will be useful for prioritization of F-box proteins for functional validation in rice.
17293435	Overexpression of an R1R2R3 MYB gene, OsMYB3R-2, increases tolerance to freezing, drought, and salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2007	Plant Physiol	We used a cDNA microarray approach to monitor the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa) under cold stress and identified 328 cold-regulated genes. Thirteen such genes encoding MYB, homeodomain, and zinc finger proteins with unknown functions showed a significant change in expression under 72-h cold stress. Among them, OsMYB3R-2 was selected for further study. Unlike most plant R2R3 MYB transcription factors, OsMYB3R-2 has three imperfect repeats in the DNA-binding domain, the same as in animal c-MYB proteins. Expression of OsMYB3R-2 was induced by cold, drought, and salt stress. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R-2 showed increased tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, and the seed germination of transgenic plants was more tolerant to abscisic acid or NaCl than that of wild type. The expression of some clod-related genes, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A, COR15a, and RCI2A, was increased to a higher level in OsMYB3R-2-overexpressing plants than in wild type. These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 acts as a master switch in stress tolerance.
17322341	Characterization of two brassinosteroid C-6 oxidase genes in pea.	2007	Plant Physiol	C-6 oxidation genes play a key role in the regulation of biologically active brassinosteroid (BR) levels in the plant. They control BR activation, which involves the C-6 oxidation of 6-deoxocastasterone (6-DeoxoCS) to castasterone (CS) and in some cases the further conversion of CS to brassinolide (BL). C-6 oxidation is controlled by the CYP85A family of cytochrome P450s, and to date, two CYP85As have been isolated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), two in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), one in rice (Oryza sativa), and one in grape (Vitis vinifera). We have now isolated two CYP85As (CYP85A1 and CYP85A6) from pea (Pisum sativum). However, unlike Arabidopsis and tomato, which both contain one BR C-6 oxidase that converts 6-DeoxoCS to CS and one BR C-6 Baeyer-Villiger oxidase that converts 6-DeoxoCS right through to BL, the two BR C-6 oxidases in pea both act principally to convert 6-DeoxoCS to CS. The isolation of these two BR C-6 oxidation genes in pea highlights the species-specific differences associated with C-6 oxidation. In addition, we have isolated a novel BR-deficient mutant, lke, which blocks the function of one of these two BR C-6 oxidases (CYP85A6). The lke mutant exhibits a phenotype intermediate between wild-type plants and previously characterized pea BR mutants (lk, lka, and lkb) and contains reduced levels of CS and increased levels of 6-DeoxoCS. To date, lke is the only mutant identified in pea that blocks the latter steps of BR biosynthesis and it will therefore provide an excellent tool to further examine the regulation of BR biosynthesis and the relative biological activities of CS and BL in pea.
17337526	An unusual posttranscriptional processing in two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase loci of cereal crops directed by short, direct repeats in response to stress conditions.	2007	Plant Physiol	Various abilities to synthesize and accumulate glycine betaine (GB) are crucial for angiosperms to develop salt and drought tolerances. In higher plants, GB is synthesized by a two-step oxidation of choline via an intermediate form of betaine aldehyde, and catalyzed by choline monooxygenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH). In this study, numerous truncated and/or recombinant transcripts of two BADH homologs resulting from an unusual posttranscriptional processing were detected in rice (Oryza sativa) and other cereal crops, including maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The observed events took place at the 5' exonic region, and led to the insertion of exogenous gene sequences and a variety of deletions that resulted in the removal of translation initiation codon, loss of functional domain, and frame-shifts with premature termination by introducing stop codon. By contrast, the BADH transcripts from dicotyledonous species, such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), had correctly processed mRNA. This suggests the differentiation of posttranscriptional processing in BADH genes potentially contributes to the variation of GB-synthesizing capacities among various plant species. In addition, comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated that extensive sequence similarities (named as short, direct repeats) are of paired presence surrounding the junctions of both the deletion and/or insertion sites in the unusual BADH transcripts. The site selection for the deletion/insertion was altered in response to the stress conditions. This indicates that the sequence elements of short, direct repeats are probably required for the recognition of the deletion/insertion sites.
17351055	A novel bioinformatics approach identifies candidate genes for the synthesis and feruloylation of arabinoxylan.	2007	Plant Physiol	Arabinoxylans (AXs) are major components of graminaceous plant cell walls, including those in the grain and straw of economically important cereals. Despite some recent advances in identifying the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes for a number of other plant cell wall polysaccharides, the genes encoding enzymes of the final stages of AX synthesis have not been identified. We have therefore adopted a novel bioinformatics approach based on estimation of differential expression of orthologous genes between taxonomic divisions of species. Over 3 million public domain cereal and dicot expressed sequence tags were mapped onto the complete sets of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes, respectively. It was assumed that genes in cereals involved in AX biosynthesis would be expressed at high levels and that their orthologs in dicotyledonous plants would be expressed at much lower levels. Considering all rice genes encoding putative glycosyl transferases (GTs) predicted to be integral membrane proteins, genes in the GT43, GT47, and GT61 families emerged as much the strongest candidates. When the search was widened to all other rice or Arabidopsis genes predicted to encode integral membrane proteins, cereal genes in Pfam family PF02458 emerged as candidates for the feruloylation of AX. Our analysis, known activities, and recent findings elsewhere are most consistent with genes in the GT43 families encoding beta-1,4-xylan synthases, genes in the GT47 family encoding xylan alpha-1,2- or alpha-1,3-arabinosyl transferases, and genes in the GT61 family encoding feruloyl-AX beta-1,2-xylosyl transferases.
17369434	Transcript profiling of the anoxic rice coleoptile.	2007	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) seeds can germinate in the complete absence of oxygen. Under anoxia, the rice coleoptile elongates, reaching a length greater than that of the aerobic one. In this article, we compared and investigated the transcriptome of rice coleoptiles grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The results allow drawing a detailed picture of the modulation of the transcripts involved in anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting up-regulation of the steps required to produce and metabolize pyruvate and its derivatives. Sugars appear to play a signaling role under anoxia, with several genes indirectly up-regulated by anoxia-driven sugar starvation. Analysis of the effects of anoxia on the expansin gene families revealed that EXPA7 and EXPB12 are likely to be involved in rice coleoptile elongation under anoxia. Genes coding for ethylene response factors and heat shock proteins are among the genes modulated by anoxia in both rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Identification of anoxia-induced ethylene response factors is suggestive because genes belonging to this gene family play a crucial role in rice tolerance to submergence, a process closely related to, but independent from, the ability to germinate under anoxia. Genes coding for some enzymes requiring oxygen for their activity are dramatically down-regulated under anoxia, suggesting the existence of an energy-saving strategy in the regulation of gene expression.
17384160	Comprehensive expression profiling of rice grain filling-related genes under high temperature using DNA microarray.	2007	Plant Physiol	To elucidate the effect of high temperature on grain-filling metabolism, developing rice (Oryza sativa) "Nipponbare" caryopses were exposed to high temperature (33 degrees C/28 degrees C) or control temperature (25 degrees C/20 degrees C) during the milky stage. Comprehensive gene screening by a 22-K DNA microarray and differential hybridization, followed by expression analysis by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, revealed that several starch synthesis-related genes, such as granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) and branching enzymes, especially BEIIb, and a cytosolic pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase gene were down-regulated by high temperature, whereas those for starch-consuming alpha-amylases and heat shock proteins were up-regulated. Biochemical analyses of starch showed that the high temperature-ripened grains contained decreased levels of amylose and long chain-enriched amylopectin, which might be attributed to the repressed expression of GBSSI and BEIIb, respectively. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of storage proteins revealed decreased accumulation of 13-kD prolamin, which is consistent with the diminished expression of prolamin genes under elevated temperature. Ripening under high temperature resulted in the occurrence of grains with various degrees of chalky appearance and decreased weight. Among them, severely chalky grains contained amylopectin enriched particularly with long chains compared to slightly chalky grains, suggesting that such alterations of amylopectin structure might be involved in grain chalkiness. However, among high temperature-tolerant and sensitive cultivars, alterations of neither amylopectin chain-length distribution nor amylose content were correlated to the degree of grain chalkiness, but rather seemed to be correlated to grain weight decrease, implying different underlying mechanisms for the varietal difference in grain chalkiness. The possible metabolic pathways affected by high temperature and their relevance to grain chalkiness are discussed.
17351053	A WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX gene represses a YABBY gene expression required for rice leaf development.	2007	Plant Physiol	YABBY and WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes have been shown to play important roles in lateral organ formation and meristem function. Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development. Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS). In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the expression of both genes was excluded from the shoot apical meristem, but the transcripts were detected in leaf primordia, young leaves, and reproductive organs without any polar distribution. The function of the two genes was studied by both overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) in transgenic rice. YAB3 RNAi induced twisted and knotted leaves lacking specialized structures such as ligule and auricles, while no phenotypic change was observed in YAB3 overexpression plants, suggesting that rice YAB3 may be required for leaf cell growth and differentiation. Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype. The expression of class I KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants. Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA-protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3. These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development.
17351054	Magnaporthe grisea infection triggers RNA variation and antisense transcript expression in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is an excellent model system to study plant-fungal interactions and host defense responses. In this study, comprehensive analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) transcriptome after M. grisea infection was conducted using robust-long serial analysis of gene expression. A total of 83,382 distinct 21-bp robust-long serial analysis of gene expression tags were identified from 627,262 individual tags isolated from the resistant (R), susceptible (S), and control (C) libraries. Sequence analysis revealed that the tags in the R and S libraries had a significant reduced matching rate to the rice genomic and expressed sequences in comparison to the C library. The high level of one-nucleotide mismatches of the R and S library tags was due to nucleotide conversions. The A-to-G and U-to-C nucleotide conversions were the most predominant types, which were induced in the M. grisea-infected plants. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the adenine deaminase and cytidine deaminase genes was highly induced after inoculation. In addition, many antisense transcripts were induced in infected plants and expression of four antisense transcripts was confirmed by strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate that there is a series of dynamic and complex transcript modifications and changes in the rice transcriptome at the M. grisea early infection stages.
18281415	Barley grain maturation and germination: metabolic pathway and regulatory network commonalities and differences highlighted by new MapMan/PageMan profiling tools.	2008	Plant Physiol	Plant seeds prepare for germination already during seed maturation. We performed a detailed transcriptome analysis of barley (Hordeum vulgare) grain maturation, desiccation, and germination in two tissue fractions (starchy endosperm/aleurone and embryo/scutellum) using the Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip. To aid data evaluation, Arabidopsis thaliana MapMan and PageMan tools were adapted to barley. The analyses allow a number of conclusions: (1) Cluster analysis revealed a smooth transition in transcription programs between late seed maturation and germination within embryo tissues, but not in the endosperm/aleurone. (2) More than 12,000 transcripts are stored in the embryo of dry barley grains, many of which are presumably activated during germination. (3) Transcriptional activation of storage reserve mobilization events occurs at an early stage of germination, well before radicle protrusion. (4) Key genes of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis are already active during grain maturation at a time when abscisic acid peaks suggesting the formation of an endogenous store of GA in the aleurone. This GA probably acts later during germination in addition to newly synthesized GA. (5) Beside the well-known role of GA in gene activation during germination spatiotemporal expression data and cis-element searches in homologous rice promoters confirm an equally important gene-activating role of abscisic acid during this developmental period. The respective regulatory webs are linked to auxin and ethylene controlled networks. In summary, new bioinformatics PageMan and MapMan tools developed in barley have been successfully used to investigate in detail the transcriptome relationships between seed maturation and germination in an important crop plant.
18245456	Herbivore-induced callose deposition on the sieve plates of rice: an important mechanism for host resistance.	2008	Plant Physiol	The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH) is a specialist herbivore on rice (Oryza sativa) that ingests phloem sap from the plant through its stylet mouthparts. Electronic penetration graphs revealed that BPH insects spent more time wandering over plants carrying the resistance genes Bph14 and Bph15, but less time ingesting phloem than they did on susceptible plants. They also showed that their feeding was frequently interrupted. Tests with [(14)C]sucrose showed that insects ingested much less phloem sap from the resistant than the susceptible plants. BPH feeding up-regulated callose synthase genes and induced callose deposition in the sieve tubes at the point where the stylet was inserted. The compact callose remained intact in the resistant plants, but genes encoding beta-1,3-glucanases were activated, causing unplugging of the sieve tube occlusions in susceptible plants. Continuing ingestion led to a remarkable reduction in the susceptible plants' sucrose content and activation of the RAmy3D gene, leading to starch hydrolysis and ultimately carbohydrate deprivation in the plants. Our results demonstrate that BPH feeding induces the deposition of callose on sieve plates in rice and that this is an important defense mechanism that prevents insects from ingesting phloem sap. In response, however, the BPH can unplug sieve tube occlusions by activating beta-1,3-glucanase genes in rice plants.
18088314	Evidence of multiple horizontal transfers of the long terminal repeat retrotransposon RIRE1 within the genus Oryza.	2008	Plant J	Horizontal gene transfer, defined as the transmission of genetic material between reproductively isolated species, has been considered for a long time to be a rare phenomenon. Most well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer have been described in prokaryotes or in animals and they often involve transposable elements. The most abundant class of transposable elements in plant genomes are the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Because of their propensity to increase their copy number while active, LTR retrotransposons can have a significant impact on genomics changes during evolution. In a previous study, we showed that in the wild rice species Oryza australiensis, 60% of the genome is composed of only three families of LTR retrotransposons named RIRE1, Wallabi and Kangourou. In the present study, using both in silico and experimental approaches, we show that one of these three families, RIRE1, has been transferred horizontally between O. australiensis and seven other reproductively isolated Oryza species. This constitutes a new case of horizontal transfer in plants.
12481052	Dasheng and RIRE2. A nonautonomous long terminal repeat element and its putative autonomous partner in the rice genome.	2002	Plant Physiol	Dasheng is one of the highest copy number long terminal repeat elements and one of the most recent elements to amplify in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. However, the absence of any significant coding capacity for retroviral proteins, including gag and pol, suggests that Dasheng is a nonautonomous element. Here, we have exploited the availability of 360 Mb of rice genomic sequence to identify a candidate autonomous element. RIRE2 is a previously described gypsy-like long terminal repeat retrotransposon with significant sequence similarity to Dasheng in the regions where putative cis factors for retrotransposition are thought to be located. Dasheng and RIRE2 elements have similar chromosomal distribution patterns and similar target site sequences, suggesting that they use the same transposition machinery. In addition, the presence of several RIRE2-Dasheng element chimeras in the genome is consistent with the copackaging of element mRNAs in the same virus-like particle. Finally, both families have recently amplified members, suggesting that they could have been co-expressed, a necessary prerequisite for RIRE2 to serve as the source of transposition machinery for Dasheng. Consistent with this hypothesis, transcripts from both elements were found in the same expressed sequence tag library.
12897975	[Characterization of the copy number of RIRE10 retrotransposon and transcriptional activity of its LTR in rice genome].	2003	Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai)	A full-length Ty3-like retrotransposon, named RIRE10, was identified on the long arm of chromosome 4 in rice genome. The internal region between two LTRs had another open reading frame in the region upstream of gag-pol sequence. The transcripts from LTR region were detected by Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR. To assess the activity of RIRE10 in rice genome, the copy number of its internal region and long terminal repeat (LTR) domain were determined by dot blot analyses. Nearly 900 solo-LTR of the RIRE10 retrotransposon exist in rice genome, apart from those LTRs that flank 65 intact RIRE retrotransposons. Based on the experimental results, the retrotransposition of RIRE10 was speculated to be influenced by two factors: transcriptional activity of LTR region and homologous recombination resulting in solo-LTR.
15695435	Genome-wide identification of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase and its closely related kinase gene families: comprehensive analysis of the CDPKs gene family in rice.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	In plants, calcium acts as a universal second messenger in various signal transduction pathways. The plant-specific calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles regulating downstream components of calcium signaling. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of rice CDPKs and identified 29 CDPK genes and eight closely related kinase genes, including five CDPK-related kinases (CRKs), one calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) and two phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase kinase-related kinases (PEPRKs). The mRNA splicing sites of the rice CDPKs, CRKs and PEPRKs (but not OsCCaMK) are highly conserved, suggesting that these kinases are derived from a common ancestor. RNA gel blot analyses revealed that the majority of rice CDPK genes exhibited tissue-specific expression. Expression of OsCPK9 was elevated in seedlings infected by rice blast, indicating that this gene plays an important role in signaling in response to rice blast treatment. Our genomic and bioinformatic analyses will provide an important foundation for further functional dissection of the rice CDPK gene family.
12096107	Cloning an iron-regulated metal transporter from rice.	2002	J Exp Bot	Rice cDNA and genomic libraries were screened in order to clone an Fe(II) transporter gene. A cDNA clone highly homologous to the Arabidopsis Fe(II) transporter gene IRT1 was isolated from Fe-deficient rice roots. The cDNA clone was named OsIRT1. A genomic clone corresponding to the cDNA was also obtained, sequenced and analysed. When expressed in yeast cells, OsIRT1 cDNA reversed the growth defects of the yeast iron-uptake mutant. Northern blot analysis revealed that OsIRT1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in roots and was induced by Fe- and Cu-deficiency. This suggests that OsIRT1 is a functional metal transporter for iron, and is actively engaged in Fe uptake from soils, especially under limiting conditions.
18678896	A triallelic system of S5 is a major regulator of the reproductive barrier and compatibility of indica-japonica hybrids in rice.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Although reproductive isolation has been a key issue in evolutionary biology for many decades in a wide range of organisms, only very recently a few genes for reproductive isolation were identified. The Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is divided into two subspecies, indica and japonica. Hybrids between indica and japonica varieties are usually highly sterile. A special group of rice germplasm, referred to as wide-compatibility varieties, is able to produce highly fertile hybrids when crossed to both indica and japonica. In this study, we cloned S5, a major locus for indica-japonica hybrid sterility and wide compatibility, using a map-based cloning approach. We show that S5 encodes an aspartic protease conditioning embryo-sac fertility. The indica (S5-i) and japonica (S5-j) alleles differ by two nucleotides. The wide compatibility gene (S5-n) has a large deletion in the N terminus of the predicted S5 protein, causing subcellular mislocalization of the protein, and thus is presumably nonfunctional. This triallelic system has a profound implication in the evolution and artificial breeding of cultivated rice. Genetic differentiation between indica and japonica would have been enforced because of the reproductive barrier caused by S5-i and S5-j, and species coherence would have been maintained by gene flow enabled by the wide compatibility gene.
18599581	Badh2, encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, inhibits the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, a major component in rice fragrance.	2008	Plant Cell	In rice (Oryza sativa), the presence of a dominant Badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) inhibits the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), a potent flavor component in rice fragrance. By contrast, its two recessive alleles, badh2-E2 and badh2-E7, induce 2AP formation. Badh2 was found to be transcribed in all tissues tested except for roots, and the transcript was detected at higher abundance in young, healthy leaves than in other tissues. Multiple Badh2 transcript lengths were detected, and the complete, full-length Badh2 transcript was much less abundant than partial Badh2 transcripts. 2AP levels were significantly reduced in cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-driven transgenic lines expressing the complete, but not the partial, Badh2 coding sequences. In accordance, the intact, full-length BADH2 protein (503 residues) appeared exclusively in nonfragrant transgenic lines and rice varieties. These results indicate that the full-length BADH2 protein encoded by Badh2 renders rice nonfragrant by inhibiting 2AP biosynthesis. The BADH2 enzyme was predicted to contain three domains: NAD binding, substrate binding, and oligomerization domains. BADH2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, where it is predicted to catalyze the oxidization of betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde (AB-ald), and 3-aminopropionaldehyde. The presence of null badh2 alleles resulted in AB-ald accumulation and enhanced 2AP biosynthesis. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that BADH2 inhibits 2AP biosynthesis by exhausting AB-ald, a presumed 2AP precursor.
18586507	Expression and in silico structural analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) hemoglobin 5.	2008	Plant Physiol Biochem	This work reports the analysis of an additional hemoglobin (hb) gene copy, hb5, in the genome of rice. The amino acid sequence of Hb5 differs from the previously determined rice Hbs 1-4 in missing 11 residues in helix E. Transcripts of hb5 were found to be ubiquitous in rice organs, and hormone- and stress-response promoters exist upstream of the rice hb5 gene. Furthermore, the modeled structure of Hb5 based on the known crystal structure of rice Hb1 is unusual in that the putative distal His is distant from the heme Fe. This observation suggests that Hb5 binds and releases O(2) easily and thus that it functions as an O(2)-carrier or in some aspects of the O(2) metabolism.
18831738	Selection and mutation on microRNA target sequences during rice evolution.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) posttranscriptionally down-regulate gene expression by binding target mRNAs. Analysis of the evolution of miRNA binding sites is helpful in understanding the co-evolution between miRNAs and their targets. To understand this process in plants a comparative analysis of miRNA-targeted duplicated gene pairs derived from a well-documented whole genome duplication (WGD) event in combination with a population genetics study of six experimentally validated miRNA binding sites in rice (O. sativa) was carried out.

RESULTS: Of the 1,331 pairs of duplicate genes from the WGD, 41 genes (29 pairs) were computationally predicted to be miRNA targets. Sequence substitution analysis indicated that the synonymous substitution rate was significantly lower in the miRNA binding sites than their 5' and 3' flanking regions. Of the 29 duplicated gene pairs, 17 have only one paralog been targeted by a miRNA. This could be due to either gain of a miRNA binding site after the WGD or because one of the duplicated genes has escaped from being a miRNA target after the WGD (loss of miRNA binding site). These possibilities were distinguished by separating miRNAs conserved in both dicots and monocot plants from rice-specific miRNAs and by phylogenetic analysis of miRNA target gene families. The gain/loss rate of miRNA binding sites was estimated to be 3.0 x 10(-9) gain/loss per year. Most (70.6%) of the gains/losses were due to nucleotide mutation. By analysis of cultivated (O. sativa; n = 30) and wild (O. rufipogon; n = 15) rice populations, no segregating site was observed in six miRNA binding sites whereas 0.12-0.20 SNPs per 21-nt or 1.53-1.80 x 10(-3) of the average pairwise nucleotide diversity (pi) were found in their flanking regions.

CONCLUSION: Both molecular evolution and population genetics support the hypothesis that conservation of miRNA binding sites is maintained by purifying selection through elimination of deleterious alleles. Nucleotide mutations play a major role in the gain/loss of miRNA binding sites during evolution.
18755256	SRWD: a novel WD40 protein subfamily regulated by salt stress in rice (OryzasativaL.).	2008	Gene	By analysis with microarray data, we found that a gene encoding a novel protein containing five WD40 repeats, was regulated by salt stress in rice and named as SRWD1 (Salt responsive WD40 protein 1). By database searching, additional four SRWD1-like genes (SRWD2-SRWD5) were found in rice genome, and these five SRWD genes formed a novel WD40 subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that plant SRWD proteins divided into four groups. The significant functional divergences during SRWD evolution were found. The tissue-specific and salt responsive expression profiling for SRWD genes was investigated based on microarray data. It was found that all five SRWD genes in rice were regulated by salt stress. Further, we found that SRWD1 was regulated with different patterns by salt stress in two rice cultivars responding differently to salt stress. Our study correlates WD40 proteins with salt stress in plants and provides fundamental information for the further investigation of plant SRWD proteins.
18566795	The rice OsLpa1 gene encodes a novel protein involved in phytic acid metabolism.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The rice low phytic acid 1 (lpa1) mutant was originally identified using a forward genetics approach. This mutant exhibits a 45% reduction in rice seed phytic acid with a molar-equivalent increase in inorganic phosphorus; however, it does not appear to differ significantly in productivity from its wild-type progenitor. A second lpa1 mutant was identified from additional screening for high seed inorganic phosphorus phenotypes. Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified a single candidate gene at the rice Lpa1 locus. Sequence analysis of the candidate gene from the lpa1 mutants revealed two independent mutations (a single base pair substitution and a single base pair deletion) that confirmed the identification of this candidate as the rice low phytic acid 1 gene, OsLpa1. The OsLpa1 gene has three splice variants. The location and nature of the two mutations suggests that these lesions only affect the translation of the predicted protein derived from the longest transcript. The proteins encoded by OsLpa1 do not have homology to any of the inositol phosphate metabolism genes recently characterized in plants, although there is homology to 2-phosphoglycerate kinase, an enzyme found in hyperthermophilic methanogens that catalyzes the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 2-phosphoglycerate. OsLpa1 represents a novel gene involved in phytic acid metabolism.
18723891	The evolution of sex-independent transmission ratio distortion involving multiple allelic interactions at a single locus in rice.	2008	Genetics	Transmission ratio distortion (TRD) is frequently observed in inter- and intraspecific hybrids of plants, leading to a violation of Mendelian inheritance. Sex-independent TRD (siTRD) was detected in a hybrid between Asian cultivated rice and its wild ancestor. Here we examined how siTRD caused by an allelic interaction at a specific locus arose in Asian rice species. The siTRD is controlled by the S6 locus via a mechanism in which the S6 allele acts as a gamete eliminator, and both the male and female gametes possessing the opposite allele (S6a) are aborted only in heterozygotes (S6/S6a). Fine mapping revealed that the S6 locus is located near the centromere of chromosome 6. Testcross experiments using near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying either the S6 or S6a alleles revealed that Asian rice strains frequently harbor an additional allele (S6n) the presence of which, in heterozygotic states (S6/S6n and S6a/S6n), does not result in siTRD. A prominent reduction in the nucleotide diversity of S6 or S6a carriers relative to that of S6n carriers was detected in the chromosomal region. These results suggest that the two incompatible alleles (S6 and S6a) arose independently from S6n and established genetically discontinuous relationships between limited constituents of the Asian rice population.
18619847	Differential regulation of rice mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) by abiotic stress.	2008	Plant Physiol Biochem	Mitogen activated protein kinase cascade plays a crucial role in various biotic and abiotic stresses, hormones, cell division and developmental processes. MAP kinase kinase being integral part of this cascade performs an important function of integrating upstream signals to mitogen activated protein kinase for further appropriate cellular responses. We here report cloning of five MAP kinase kinase members from Oryza sativa indica cultivar var. Pusa Basmati 1, namely MAP kinase kinases 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10-2. All these members, except MKK10-2 possess fully canonical motif structures of MAP kinase kinase. The deduced amino acid sequence showed changes at certain position within japonica and indica variety of rice. Analysis of transcript regulation by quantitative real time PCR revealed that these five members are differentially regulated by cold, heat, salinity and drought stresses. MAP kinase kinases 4 and 6 are strongly regulated by cold and salt stresses while MAP kinase kinase 1 is regulated by salt and drought stresses. MAP kinase kinase 10-2 is regulated only by cold stress. The study provides the indication of involvement of specific MAP kinase kinase in different abiotic stress signaling and also possible cross talks that exist during the signaling processes.
18820696	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	The closely related wild rice species Oryza rufipogon is considered the progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). The transition from the characteristic plant architecture of wild rice to that of cultivated rice was one of the most important events in rice domestication; however, the molecular basis of this key domestication transition has not been elucidated. Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers. The gene encodes a newly identified zinc-finger nuclear transcription factor with transcriptional activity and is mapped on chromosome 7. PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation. Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice.
14645394	The rice pyruvate decarboxylase 3 gene, which lacks introns, is transcribed in mature pollen.	2004	J Exp Bot	The rice pyruvate decarboxylase 3 gene (PDC3), which has no introns, was previously postulated to be a pseudogene because no PDC3 mRNA had been detected, even under anaerobic conditions. However, in this study, it was found that rice PDC3 transcripts accumulated in panicles after heading. Within anthers obtained from the panicles, PDC3 was shown to be transcribed in mature pollen by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that the rice PDC3 is a functional gene. Its product may play a role in aerobic alcoholic fermentation in mature pollen.
18718933	Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Because protein synthesis begins with N-formylmethionine in plant endosymbiotic organelles, removal of the formyl group by peptide deformylase (PDF) is essential to allowing the excision of the first methionine. Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes. Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions. OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves. Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria. We used T-DNA insertional alleles to elucidate functional roles associated with OsPDF1B. Homozygous plants of pdf1b/pdf1b exhibited the phenotypes of chlorina and growth retardation. Histochemical analysis showed that the length of their mesophyll cells was increased 4- to 5-fold, resulting in a reduction in the total number of cells. Transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that chloroplasts were severely damaged and mitochondria appeared to be mildly altered in the pdf1b mutants. Expression of genes encoded in the chloroplasts and mitochondria was altered in the mutants. Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria.
18421420	OsITL1 gene encoding an inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase is a negative regulator of osmotic stress signaling.	2008	Biotechnol Lett	The expression of the gene OsITL1 coding for the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase protein was induced by 200 mM NaCl or dehydration. The expression of OsITL1 in response to NaCl and dehydration suggests the possible functions of OsITL1 in osmotic stress responses; however, physiological tests indicate that the expression of OsITL1 in tobacco decreases tolerance to NaCl during germination and seedling development. This result was consistent with that obtained on treatment of mature tobacco seedlings with NaCl (200 mM), suggesting that OsITL1 inversely regulates plant responses to osmotic stress.
18695945	Homologous recombination properties of OsRad51, a recombinase from rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	cDNA corresponding to OsRad51 protein was isolated from cDNA library of rice flowers (Oryza sativa, Indica cultivar group) and cloned in to pET28a expression vector. The protein was over expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified. Purified OsRad51 could bind single and double stranded DNA, however it showed higher affinity for single stranded DNA. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies of OsRad51-DNA complexes showed that this protein formed ring like structures and bound DNA forming filaments. OsRad51 protein promoted renaturation of complementary single strands in to duplex DNA molecules and also showed ATPase activity, which was stimulated by single strand DNA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays revealed that OsRad51 promoted homology dependent renaturation as well as strand exchange reactions. Renaturation activity was ATP dependent; however strand exchange activity was ATP independent. This is the first report on in vitro characterization of Rad51 protein from crop plants.
18621947	Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm.	2008	Plant Cell	Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. From mutant stocks induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment, we identified plants with mutations in the Pho1 gene that are deficient in Pho1. Strikingly, the size of mature seeds and the starch content in these mutants showed considerable variation, ranging from shrunken to pseudonormal. The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure. Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect. The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent. While the mutant plants grown at 30 degrees C produced mainly plump seeds at maturity, most of the seeds from plants grown at 20 degrees C were shrunken, with a significant proportion showing severe reduction in starch accumulation. These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures.
18643954	Inositol methyl tranferase from a halophytic wild rice, Porteresia coarctata Roxb. (Tateoka): regulation of pinitol synthesis under abiotic stress.	2008	Plant Cell Environ	Methylated inositol D-pinitol (3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol) accumulates in a number of plants naturally or in response to stress. Here, we present evidence for accumulation and salt-enhanced synthesis of pinitol in Porteresia coarctata, a halophytic wild rice, in contrast to its absence in domesticated rice. A cDNA for Porteresia coarctata inositol methyl transferase 1 (PcIMT1), coding for the inositol methyl transferase implicated in the synthesis of pinitol has been cloned from P. coarctata, bacterially overexpressed and shown to be functional in vitro. In silico analysis confirms the absence of an IMT1 homolog in Oryza genome, and PcIMT1 is identified as phylogenetically remotely related to the methyl transferase gene family in rice. Both transcript and proteomic analysis show the up-regulation of PcIMT1 expression following exposure to salinity. Coordinated expression of L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (PcINO1) gene along with PcIMT1 indicates that in P. coarctata, accumulation of pinitol via inositol is a stress-regulated pathway. The presence of pinitol synthesizing protein/gene in a wild halophytic rice is remarkable, although its exact role in salt tolerance of P. coarctata cannot be currently ascertained. The enhanced synthesis of pinitol in Porteresia under stress may be one of the adaptive features employed by the plant in addition to its known salt-exclusion mechanism.
18820699	Control of a key transition from prostrate to erect growth in rice domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	The transition from the prostrate growth of ancestral wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.) to the erect growth of Oryza sativa cultivars was one of the most critical events in rice domestication. This evolutionary step importantly improved plant architecture and increased grain yield. Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi-dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys(2)-His(2) zinc-finger protein. prog1 variants identified in O. sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice. Sequence comparison shows that 182 varieties of cultivated rice, including 87 indica and 95 japonica cultivars from 17 countries, carry identical mutations in the prog1 coding region that may have become fixed during rice domestication.
15020633	Cloning of a cDNA encoding an ETR2-like protein (Os-ERL1) from deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.) and increase in its mRNA level by submergence, ethylene, and gibberellin treatments.	2004	J Exp Bot	A cDNA from deep water rice treated with ethylene, encoding an ethylene receptor homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana ETR2 and EIN4, was isolated using differential display and RACE techniques. The cDNA (2880 bp), corresponding to the Os-ERL1 gene (Oryza sativa ETHYLENE RESPONSE 2 like 1; GenBank accession number AB107219), contained an open reading frame of 2289 bp coding for 763 amino acids. The protein Os-ERL1 has 50% and 52% similarity to Arabidopsis ETR2 and EIN4, respectively. The Os-ERL1 gene was up-regulated by flooding, and by treatment with ethylene and gibberellin. These results suggest that deep water rice responds to flooding by increasing the number of its ethylene receptors.
18326788	A third phytoene synthase is devoted to abiotic stress-induced abscisic acid formation in rice and defines functional diversification of phytoene synthase genes.	2008	Plant Physiol	We here report on the characterization of a novel third phytoene synthase gene (PSY) in rice (Oryza sativa), OsPSY3, and on the differences among all three PSY genes with respect to the tissue-specific expression and regulation upon various environmental stimuli. The two already known PSYs are under phytochrome control and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in photosynthetically active tissues and exhibit different expression patterns during chloroplast development. In contrast, OsPSY3 transcript levels are not affected by light and show almost no tissue-specific differences. Rather, OsPSY3 transcripts are up-regulated during increased abscisic acid (ABA) formation upon salt treatment and drought, especially in roots. The simultaneous induction of genes encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs), involved in the initial steps of ABA biosynthesis, indicate that decreased xanthophyll levels are compensated by the induction of the third PSY gene. Furthermore, OsPSY3 and the OsNCEDs investigated were also induced by the application of ABA, indicating positive feedback regulation. The regulatory differences are mirrored by cis-acting elements in the corresponding promoter regions, with light-responsive elements for OsPSY1 and OsPSY2 and an ABA-response element as well as a coupling element for OsPSY3. The investigation of the gene structures and 5' untranslated regions revealed that OsPSY1 represents a descendant of an ancient PSY gene present in the common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Since the genomic structures of OsPSY2 and OsPSY3 are comparable, we conclude that they originated from the most recent common ancestor, OsPSY1.
18725639	RID1, encoding a Cys2/His2-type zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a master switch from vegetative to floral development in rice.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transition from the vegetative phase to reproductive phase is a crucial process in the life cycle of higher plants. Although the molecular mechanisms of flowering regulation have been extensively characterized in a number of plant species, little is known regarding how the transition process initiates. Here, we show that the Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1) gene acts as the master switch for the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase. RID1 encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type zinc finger transcription factor that does not have an ortholog in Arabidopsis spp. A RID1 knockout (rid1), mutated by T-DNA insertion, never headed after growing for >500 days under a range of growth conditions and is thus referred to as a never-flowering phenotype. This mutation-suppressed expression of the genes is known to be involved in flowering regulation, especially in the Ehd1/Hd3a pathway and a series of RFT homologs. RID1 seems to be independent of the circadian clock. A model was proposed to place RID1 in the molecular pathways of flowering regulation in rice, for which there are two indispensable elements. In the first, RID1 is controlling the phase transition and initiation of floral induction. In the other, the Hd3a/RFL1/FTL complex acts as the immediate inducer of flowering. Loss of function in either element would cause never-flowering. Once the phase transition is induced with the activation of RID1, flowering signal is transduced and regulated through the various pathways and eventually integrated with FT-like proteins to induce flowering.
18679055	Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene OsBIDK1 enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco.	2008	Mol Cells	A rice diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) gene, OsBIDK1, which encodes a 499-amino acid protein, was cloned and characterized. OsBIDK1 contains a conserved DGK domain, consisting of a diacylglycerol kinase catalytic subdomain and a diacylglycerol kinase accessory subdomain. Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease. In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIDK1 was induced earlier and at a higher level than in water-treated control seedlings after inoculation with M. grisea. Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express the OsBIDK1 gene were generated and disease resistance assays showed that overexpression of OsBIDK1 in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced resistance against infection by tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. These results suggest that OsBIDK1 may play a role in disease resistance responses.
18687877	A diverse set of microRNAs and microRNA-like small RNAs in developing rice grains.	2008	Genome Res	Endogenous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), function as post-transcriptional or transcriptional regulators in plants. miRNA function is essential for normal plant development and therefore is likely to be important in the growth of the rice grain. To investigate the roles of miRNAs in rice grain development, we carried out deep sequencing of the small RNA populations of rice grains at two developmental stages. In a data set of approximately 5.5 million sequences, we found representatives of all 20 conserved plant miRNA families. We used an approach based on the presence of miRNA and miRNA* sequences to identify 39 novel, nonconserved rice miRNA families expressed in grains. Cleavage of predicted target mRNAs was confirmed for a number of the new miRNAs. We identified a putative mirtron, indicating that plants may also use spliced introns as a source of miRNAs. We also identified a miRNA-like long hairpin that generates phased 21 nt small RNAs, strongly expressed in developing grains, and show that these small RNAs act in trans to cleave target mRNAs. Comparison of the population of miRNAs and miRNA-like siRNAs in grains to those in other parts of the rice plant reveals that many are expressed in an organ-specific manner.
18757558	Arabidopsis TONNEAU1 proteins are essential for preprophase band formation and interact with centrin.	2008	Plant Cell	Plant cells have specific microtubule structures involved in cell division and elongation. The tonneau1 (ton1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana displays drastic defects in morphogenesis, positioning of division planes, and cellular organization. These are primarily caused by dysfunction of the cortical cytoskeleton and absence of the preprophase band of microtubules. Characterization of the ton1 insertional mutant reveals complex chromosomal rearrangements leading to simultaneous disruption of two highly similar genes in tandem, TON1a and TON1b. TON1 proteins are conserved in land plants and share sequence motifs with human centrosomal proteins. The TON1 protein associates with soluble and microsomal fractions of Arabidopsis cells, and a green fluorescent protein-TON1 fusion labels cortical cytoskeletal structures, including the preprophase band and the interphase cortical array. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Arabidopsis centrin as a potential TON1 partner. This interaction was confirmed both in vitro and in plant cells. The similarity of TON1 with centrosomal proteins and its interaction with centrin, another key component of microtubule organizing centers, suggests that functions involved in the organization of microtubule arrays by the centrosome were conserved across the evolutionary divergence between plants and animals.
8900187	Carbohydrate starvation stimulates differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes that is modulated through complicated transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.	1996	J Biol Chem	Expression of alpha-amylase genes in cultured rice suspension cells is induced by sucrose starvation. To study the mechanism of sugar metabolite regulation on the expression of individual alpha-amylase genes, DNA fragments specific to each of eight rice alpha-amylase genes were synthesized and used as gene-specific probes. Comparison of the relative abundance of mRNA revealed that expression of the eight alpha-amylase genes in rice cells was differentially regulated by sucrose starvation. Accumulation of all the alpha-amylase mRNAs increased in response to sucrose starvation; however, levels of the alphaAmy3 and alphaAmy8 mRNAs were distinctly higher and constituted 90% of total alpha-amylase mRNAs. RNA gel blot and nuclear run-on transcription analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between the increased transcription rates and the elevated steady-state levels of alpha-amylase mRNAs induced by sucrose starvation. The half-lives of alphaAmy3, alphaAmy7, and alphaAmy8 were prolonged by sucrose-starvation; however, the stability of the three mRNAs seems controlled by different mechanisms. The translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin preferentially blocked the sucrose-suppressed expression of alphaAmy3 but not that of alphaAmy7 and alphaAmy8. These inhibitors also enhanced the sucrose starvation-induced accumulation of alphaAmy3 mRNA but not that of alphaAmy7 or alphaAmy8 mRNAs. Cycloheximide did not significantly alter the transcription rates of alpha-amylase genes, suggesting that labile proteins may selectively stabilize the alphaAmy7 and alphaAmy8 mRNAs but destabilize the alphaAmy3 mRNA.
11333304	Characterization of an isoform of rice starch branching enzyme, RBE4, in developing seeds.	2001	Plant Cell Physiol	cDNA clones encoding an isoform of starch branching enzyme, RBE4, have been identified from a developing rice seed cDNA library, using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of RBE4. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence indicated that RBE4 is initially produced as a precursor protein of 841 amino acids, including a 53-residue transit peptide at the N-terminus. The mature form of RBE4 shared a high degree of sequence identity (80%) with mature RBE3, and possessed an N-terminal extra sequence, as found in RBE3. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the RBE4 gene is expressed in both leaves and developing seeds. The RBE4 gene was distinguished from the RBE1 and RBE3 genes by expression at the earlier stages of seed development. To examine enzymatic functions of RBE4, recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli cells, and purified by two chromatographic separations. The branched alpha-glucans produced by the recombinant enzymes from potato amylose revealed the different patterns of oligosaccharide chain transfer. The peak of major branches of the products by RBE3 or RBE4 was 6 glucose units, whereas the peaks of major branches of the products by RBE1 were 6 and 11 glucose units. The similar property between RBE3 and RBE4 is supported by high similarity of the amino acid sequences between them.
18073142	Transcriptional regulation of FHL1 by TLX1/HOX11 is dosage, cell-type and promoter context-dependent.	2008	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	TLX1/HOX11 encodes an NK-like homeodomain transcription factor that is both normally required for embryonic development and aberrantly expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Previous studies have shown that TLX1 can regulate target genes including ALDH1A1 and FHL1. However, whereas ALDH1A1 is consistently regulated by TLX1, endogenous FHL1 is only induced in a proportion of fibroblast or T-cell clones stably expressing TLX1. Here, we provide an explanation for these findings by demonstrating that the induction of FHL1, but not ALDH1A1, requires a high level of TLX1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells. In luciferase reporter assays, TLX1-mediated repression rather than activation of the FHL1 gene promoter and the magnitude of this effect was strongly influenced by the cellular background. Together, these results characterize TLX1 as a dual function regulator whose activity in respect to FHL1 is critically dependent upon its cellular concentration, as well as cell type and promoter context.
18245346	A Drosophila gain-of-function screen for candidate genes involved in steroid-dependent neuroendocrine cell remodeling.	2008	Genetics	The normal functioning of neuroendocrine systems requires that many neuropeptidergic cells change, to alter transmitter identity and concentration, electrical properties, and cellular morphology in response to hormonal cues. During insect metamorphosis, a pulse of circulating steroids, ecdysteroids, governs the dramatic remodeling of larval neurons to serve adult-specific functions. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying metamorphic remodeling, we conducted a neuropeptidergic cell-targeted, gain-of-function genetic screen. We screened 6097 lines. Each line permitted Gal4-regulated transcription of flanking genes. A total of 58 lines, representing 51 loci, showed defects in neuropeptide-mediated developmental transitions (ecdysis or wing expansion) when crossed to the panneuropeptidergic Gal4 driver, 386Y-Gal4. In a secondary screen, we found 29 loci that produced wing expansion defects when crossed to a crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP)/bursicon neuron-specific Gal4 driver. At least 14 loci disrupted the formation or maintenance of adult-specific CCAP/bursicon cell projections during metamorphosis. These include components of the insulin and epidermal growth factor signaling pathways, an ecdysteroid-response gene, cabut, and an ubiquitin-specific protease gene, fat facets, with known functions in neuronal development. Several additional genes, including three micro-RNA loci and two factors related to signaling by Myb-like proto-oncogenes, have not previously been implicated in steroid signaling or neuronal remodeling.
18388201	The lattice as allosteric effector: structural studies of alphabeta- and gamma-tubulin clarify the role of GTP in microtubule assembly.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	GTP-dependent microtubule polymerization dynamics are required for cell division and are accompanied by domain rearrangements in the polymerizing subunit, alphabeta-tubulin. Two opposing models describe the role of GTP and its relationship to conformational change in alphabeta-tubulin. The allosteric model posits that unpolymerized alphabeta-tubulin adopts a more polymerization-competent conformation upon GTP binding. The lattice model posits that conformational changes occur only upon recruitment into the growing lattice. Published data support a lattice model, but are largely indirect and so the allosteric model has prevailed. We present two independent solution probes of the conformation of alphabeta-tubulin, the 2.3 A crystal structure of gamma-tubulin bound to GDP, and kinetic simulations to interpret the functional consequences of the structural data. These results (with our previous gamma-tubulin:GTPgammaS structure) support the lattice model by demonstrating that major domain rearrangements do not occur in eukaryotic tubulins in response to GTP binding, and that the unpolymerized conformation of alphabeta-tubulin differs significantly from the polymerized one. Thus, geometric constraints of lateral self-assembly must drive alphabeta-tubulin conformational changes, whereas GTP plays a secondary role to tune the strength of longitudinal contacts within the microtubule lattice. alphabeta-Tubulin behaves like a bent spring, resisting straightening until forced to do so by GTP-mediated interactions with the growing microtubule. Kinetic simulations demonstrate that resistance to straightening opposes microtubule initiation by specifically destabilizing early assembly intermediates that are especially sensitive to the strength of lateral interactions. These data provide new insights into the molecular origins of dynamic microtubule behavior.
18392778	Sucrose induction of Arabidopsis miR398 represses two Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nt RNAs that reduce target accumulation through mRNA cleavage or translational repression. Arabidopsis miR398 regulates mRNAs encoding two copper superoxide dismutase (CSD) enzymes and a cytochrome c oxidase subunit. miR398 itself is down-regulated in response to copper and stress. Here we show that miR398 is positively regulated by sucrose, resulting in decreased CSD1 and CSD2 mRNA and protein accumulation. This sucrose regulation is maintained both in the presence and absence of physiologically relevant levels of supplemental copper. Additionally, we show that plants expressing CSD1 and CSD2 mRNAs with altered miR398 complementarity sites display increased mRNA accumulation, whereas CSD1 and CSD2 protein accumulation remain sensitive to miR398 levels, suggesting that miR398 can act as a translational repressor when target site complementarity is reduced. These results reveal a novel miR398 regulatory mechanism and demonstrate that plant miRNA targets can resist miRNA regulation at the mRNA level while maintaining sensitivity at the level of protein accumulation. Our results suggest that even in plants, where miRNAs are thought to act primarily through target mRNA cleavage, monitoring target protein levels along with target mRNA levels is necessary to fully assess the consequences of disrupted miRNA-mRNA pairing. Moreover, the limited complementarity required to maintain robust miR398-directed repression of target protein accumulation suggests that similarly regulated endogenous plant miRNA targets may have eluded detection.
18398005	Fine structure mapping of a gene-rich region of wheat carrying Ph1, a suppressor of crossing over between homoeologous chromosomes.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The wheat gene-rich region (GRR) 5L0.5 contains many important genes, including Ph1, the principal regulator of chromosome pairing. Comparative marker analysis identified 32 genes for the GRR controlling important agronomic traits. Detailed characterization of this region was accomplished by first physically localizing 213 wheat group 5L-specific markers, using group 5 nulli-tetrasomics, three Ph1 gene deletion/insertion mutants, and nine terminal deletion lines with their breakpoints around the 5L0.5 region. The Ph1 gene was localized to a much smaller region within the GRR (Ph1 gene region). Of the 61 markers that mapped in the four subregions of the GRR, 9 mapped in the Ph1 gene region. High stringency sequence comparison (e < 1 x10(-25)) of 157 group 5L-specific wheat ESTs identified orthologs for 80% sequences in rice and 71% in Arabidopsis. Rice orthologs were present on all rice chromosomes, although most (34%) were on rice chromosome 9 (R9). No single collinear region was identified in Arabidopsis even for a smaller region, such as the Ph1 gene region. Seven of the nine Ph1 gene region markers mapped within a 450-kb region on R9 with the same gene order. Detailed domain/motif analysis of the 91 putative genes present in the 450-kb region identified 26 candidates for the Ph1 gene, including genes involved in chromatin reorganization, microtubule attachment, acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, DNA binding, and meiosis/anther specific proteins. Five of these genes shared common domains/motifs with the meiosis specific genes Zip1, Scp1, Cor1, RAD50, RAD51, and RAD57. Wheat and Arabidopsis homologs for these rice genes were identified.
18401574	Boron toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). I. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of tolerance to boron toxicity.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Boron toxicity tolerance of rice plants was studied. Modern japonica subspecies such as Koshihikari, Nipponbare, and Sasanishiki were tolerant, whereas indica subspecies such as Kasalath and IR36 were intolerant to excessive application of boron (B), even though their shoot B contents under B toxicity were not significantly different. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of japonica Nekken-1 and indica IR36 were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to identify the gene responsible for B toxicity tolerance. A major QTL that could explain 45% of the phenotypic variation was detected in chromosome 4. The QTL was confirmed using a population derived from a recombinant inbred line which is heterogenic at the QTL region. The QTL was also confirmed in other chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs).
18409027	Site specific cytosine methylation in rice nonautonomous transposable element nDart.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	The mobile nonautonomous element nDart, which is active in intact rice plants, exhibits locus specific transposition. Due to the high homogeneity of nDart elements, the locus specificity of nDart transposition might be controlled by factors other than genetic differences. In this study, we elucidated the regulation of the locus specificity of nDart transposition. The difference of transpositional activities in 10 nDart elements among rice varieties exhibiting nDart transposition was clearly correlated with the methylation state of nDart elements. Both hyper- and hypo-methylated nDart elements were inactive, while site specific methylation in both subterminal regions was identified in active nDart loci. The specific methylation sites contain the pentamer motif GCC/ACG. The repeated motifs in the subterminal region of nDart elements may contribute to the stable secondary structure of nDart elements with low free energy. Our results suggested that site specific cytosine methylation may loosen the stable secondary structure of the nDart element to allow it to bind TPase, which then perform the excision of nDart elements from genomic loci.
18410482	The cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RNA binding protein OsTudor-SN: evidence for an essential role in storage protein RNA transport and localization.	2008	Plant J	Previous studies have demonstrated that the major storage protein RNAs found in the rice endosperm are transported as particles via actomyosin to specific subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we examined the potential role of OsTudor-SN, a major cytoskeletal-associated RNA binding protein, in RNA transport and localization. OsTudor-SN molecules occur as high-molecular-weight forms, the integrity of which are sensitive to RNase. Immunoprecipitation followed by RT-PCR showed that OsTudor-SN binds prolamine and glutelin RNAs. Immunofluorescence studies using affinity-purified antibodies show that OsTudor-SNs exists as particles in the cytoplasm, and are distributed to both the protein body endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cisternal ER. Examination of OsTudor-SN particles in transgenic rice plants expressing GFP-tagged prolamine RNA transport particles showed co-localization of OsTudor-SN and GFP, suggesting a role in RNA transport. Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged OsTudor-SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors. Downregulation of OsTudor-SN by antisense and RNAi resulted in a decrease in steady state prolamine RNA and protein levels, and a reduction in the number of prolamine protein bodies. Collectively, these results show that OsTudor-SN is a component of the RNA transport particle, and may control storage protein biosynthesis by regulating one or more processes leading to the transport, localization and anchoring of their RNAs to the cortical ER.
18420595	Overexpression of a new rice vacuolar antiporter regulating protein OsARP improves salt tolerance in tobacco.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	We examined the function of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) antiporter-regulating protein OsARP by overexpressing it in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). In public databases, this protein was annotated as a putative Os02g0465900 protein of rice. The OsARP gene was introduced into tobacco under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The transformants were selected for their ability to grow on medium containing kanamycin. Incorporation of the transgene in the genome of tobacco was confirmed by PCR, and its expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Transgenic plants had better growth and vigor than non-transgenic plants under salt stress in vitro. Overexpression of OsARP in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in salt tolerance, and the plants had a higher rate of photosynthesis and effective PSII photon yield when compared with the wild type. The OsARP protein was localized in the tonoplast of rice plants. Transgenic plants accumulated more Na+ in their leaf tissue than did wild-type plants. It is conceivable that the toxic effect of Na+ in the cytosol might be reduced by sequestration into vacuoles. The rate of water loss was higher in the wild type than in transgenic plants under salt stress. Increased vacuolar solute accumulation and water retention could confer salt tolerance in transgenic plants. Tonoplast vesicles isolated from OsARP transgenic plants showed Na+/H+ exchange rates 3-fold higher than those of wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsARP on the tonoplasts plays an important role in compartmentation of Na+ into vacuoles. We suggest that OsARP is a new type of protein participating in Na+ uptake in vacuoles.
18430767	Granule-bound starch synthase I is responsible for biosynthesis of extra-long unit chains of amylopectin in rice.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	A rice Wx gene encoding a granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) was introduced into the null-mutant waxy (wx) rice, and its effect on endosperm starches was examined. The apparent amylose content was increased from undetectable amounts for the non-transgenic wx cultivars to 21.6-22.2% of starch weight for the transgenic lines. The increase was in part due to a significant amount of extra-long unit chains (ELCs) of amylopectin (7.5-8.4% of amylopectin weight), that were absent in the non-transgenic wx cultivars. Thus, actual amylose content was calculated to be 14.9-16.0% for the transgenic lines. Only slight differences were found in chain-length distribution for the chains other than ELCs, indicating that the major effect of the Wx transgene on amylopectin structure was ELC formation. ELCs isolated from debranched amylopectin exhibited structures distinct from amylose. Structures of amylose from the transgenic lines were slightly different from those of cv. Labelle (Wx(a)) in terms of a higher degree of branching and size distribution. The amylose and ELC content of starches of the transgenic lines resulted in the elevation of pasting temperature, a 50% decrease in peak viscosity, a large decrease in breakdown and an increase in setback. As yet undetermined factors other than the GBSSI activity are thought to be involved in the control of formation and/or the amount of ELCs. Structural analysis of the Wx gene suggested that the presence of a tyrosine residue at position 224 of GBSSI correlates with the formation of large amounts of ELCs in cultivars carrying Wx(a).
18432238	Crystal structures of DNA/RNA repair enzymes AlkB and ABH2 bound to dsDNA.	2008	Nature	Escherichia coli AlkB and its human homologues ABH2 and ABH3 repair DNA/RNA base lesions by using a direct oxidative dealkylation mechanism. ABH2 has the primary role of guarding mammalian genomes against 1-meA damage by repairing this lesion in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas AlkB and ABH3 preferentially repair single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions and can repair damaged bases in RNA. Here we show the first crystal structures of AlkB-dsDNA and ABH2-dsDNA complexes, stabilized by a chemical cross-linking strategy. This study reveals that AlkB uses an unprecedented base-flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it squeezes together the two bases flanking the flipped-out one to maintain the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing ssDNA lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the first crystal structure of ABH2, presented here, provides a structural basis for designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein.
18433437	Wheat FT protein regulates VRN1 transcription through interactions with FDL2.	2008	Plant J	SUMMARY: A precise regulation of flowering time is central to plant species survival. Therefore, mechanisms have evolved in plants to integrate various environmental cues to optimize flowering time. In this study, we show that the product of the wheat gene TaFT, which integrates photoperiod and vernalization signals promoting flowering, interacts with bZIP proteins TaFDL2 and TaFDL6. We also show that TaFDL2 can interact in vitro with five ACGT elements in the promoter of the meristem identity gene VRN1, suggesting that TaFDL2 is a functional homologue of Arabidopsis FD. No direct interactions between the TaFT protein and the VRN1 promoter were detected. Transgenic wheat plants over-expressing TaFT showed parallel increases in VRN1 transcripts, suggesting that TaFT provides transcriptional activation of VRN1, possibly through interactions with the TaFDL2 protein. The same transgenic plants also showed increased transcript levels of TaFT2 (a TaFT paralogue), indicating that TaFT2 acts downstream of TaFT. The fact that TaFT2 interacts with another bZIP protein TaFDL13, which lacks the ability to interact with the VRN1 promoter, suggests that TaFT and TaFT2 have different gene targets. This observation agrees with the functional divergence observed for the TaFT and TaFT2 orthologous genes in rice. The temperate cereals analyzed so far show VRN1 transcripts in the leaves, a characteristic not observed in Arabidopsis or rice. The high levels of TaFDL2 transcripts observed in wheat leaves provide a simple explanation for this difference. We present a hypothesis to explain the conservation of VRN1 expression in the leaves of temperate cereals.
18438440	Characterization and mapping of a male-sterility mutant, tapetum desquamation (t), in rice.	2008	Genome	A spontaneously mutated male-sterile material was found among the offspring of the indica restorer line Jinhuiyihao. To understand the status and function of the related gene and clone the gene, a near-isogenic line (NIL) of the male sterility was bred, and characterization of the mutant and gene mapping were performed. The results indicated that there are obvious differences between the male-sterile NIL and the indica maintainer line II-32B. The anther size of the NIL is smaller than that of II-32B, and the anther color is white in the NIL but yellow in II-32B. No pollen from the matured anther in the NIL was observed to be stained using KI-I2 solution. In transverse sections of the sterile anther, at early microspore stage the cytoplasm of the tapetum concentrates but the tapetum itself does not degenerate after microspores are released from the tetrads; the tapetum then desquamates from the anther wall and enwraps microspores; subsequently, the surrounded microspores collapse completely at late microspore and early bicellular pollen stages. Inheritance analysis showed that the male sterility was controlled by a single recessive gene, ostd (t). This gene was mapped between the SSR markers RM7434 and RM275 on chromosome 6, and the physical distance from RM7434 to RM275 is about 389 kb.
18438637	Development of genic-microsatellite markers for sorghum staygreen QTL using a comparative genomic approach with rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The already available comprehensive genome sequence information of model crops along with the transcriptomic resource from other crops provides an excellent opportunity for comparative genome analysis. We studied the synteny between each of the four major sorghum staygreen quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions with that in the rice genome and attempted to increase marker density around the QTL with genic-microsatellites from the sorghum transcriptomic resource using the rice genome as template. For each of the sorghum QTL regions, the reported RFLP markers were compiled, used for sequence similarity searches against the rice genome which identified syntenous regions on rice chromosome 1 for Stg1 and Stg2 QTL, on chromosome 9 for Stg3 QTL, and on chromosome 11 for Stg4 QTL. Using the Gramene genome browsing tool, 869 non-redundant sorghum expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were selected and 50 genic-microsatellites (18, 12, 15, and 5, for Stg1, Stg2, Stg3, and Stg4 QTL, respectively) could be developed. We could experimentally establish synteny of the Stg1, Stg2, Stg3, and Stg4 QTL regions with that of the rice genome by mapping ten polymorphic genic-microsatellite markers (20%) to the positions of the staygreen QTL. The simple strategy demonstrated in the present study could readily be extrapolated to other cereals of the Poaceae family. The markers developed in this study provide a basis for the isolation of genes underling these QTL using an association study or map-based gene isolation approach, and create an additional option for MAS of the staygreen trait in sorghum.
18438730	Characterization and comparison of intron structure and alternative splicing between Medicago truncatula, Populus trichocarpa, Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Alignment of transcripts and genome sequences yielded a set of alternatively spliced transcripts in four angiosperm genomes: three dicotyledon species Medicago truncatula (Medicago), Populus trichocarpa (poplar) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), and the monocotyledon Oryzae sativa (rice). Intron retention was the predominant mode of alternative splicing (AS) in each species, consistent with previous reports for Arabidopsis and rice. We analyzed the structure of 5'-splice junctions and observed commonalities between species. There was dependency of base composition between sites flanking the 5'-splice junction, with the potential to create a subset of splice sites that interact more weakly or strongly than average with U1 snRNA. Such altered nucleotide composition was correlated with splicing fidelity in all four species. For Medicago, poplar and Arabidopsis, but not in rice, alternative splicing was most prevalent for introns with decreased UA content, consistent with lower UA content for monocot introns and potentially reflecting evolved differences in splicing mechanisms. Similarly, the occurrence of AS between transcript Gene Ontology categories was positively correlated between Arabidopsis and Medicago, with no correlation between dicots and rice. Analysis of within-species paralogs and between-species reciprocal best-hit homologs yielded rare cases of potentially conserved AS events. Reverse transcriptase PCR and amplicon sequencing were used to confirm a subset of the in silico-predicted AS events within Medicago, as well as to characterize conserved AS events between Medicago and Arabidopsis.
18451033	Investigations of valanimycin biosynthesis: elucidation of the role of seryl-tRNA.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The antibiotic valanimycin is a naturally occurring azoxy compound produced by Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456-hF10. Precursor incorporation experiments showed that valanimycin is derived from l-valine and l-serine via the intermediacy of isobutylamine and isobutylhydroxylamine. Enzymatic and genetic investigations led to the cloning and sequencing of the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster, which was found to contain 14 genes. A novel feature of the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster is the presence of a gene (vlmL) that encodes a class II seryl-tRNA synthetase. Previous studies suggested that the role of this enzyme is to provide seryl-tRNA for the valanimycin biosynthetic pathway. Here, we report the results of investigations to elucidate the role of seryl-tRNA in valanimycin biosynthesis. A combination of enzymatic and chemical studies has revealed that the VlmA protein encoded by the valanimycin biosynthetic gene cluster catalyzes the transfer of the seryl residue from seryl-tRNA to the hydroxyl group of isobutylhydroxylamine to produce the ester O-seryl-isobutylhydroxylamine. These findings provide an example of the involvement of an aminoacyl-tRNA in an antibiotic biosynthetic pathway.
18451263	The "old" Euonymus europaeus agglutinin represents a novel family of ubiquitous plant proteins.	2008	Plant Physiol	Molecular cloning of the "old" but still unclassified Euonymus europaeus agglutinin (EEA) demonstrated that the lectin is a homodimeric protein composed of 152 residue subunits. Analysis of the deduced sequence indicated that EEA is synthesized without a signal peptide and undergoes no posttranslational processing apart from the removal of a six-residue N-terminal peptide. Glycan array screening confirmed the previously reported high reactivity of EEA toward blood group B oligosaccharides but also revealed binding to high mannose N-glycans, providing firm evidence for the occurrence of a plant carbohydrate-binding domain that can interact with structurally different glycans. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches indicated that EEA shares no detectable sequence similarity with any other lectin but is closely related evolutionarily to a domain that was first identified in some abscisic acid- and salt stress-responsive rice (Oryza sativa) proteins, and, according to the available sequence data, might be ubiquitous in Spermatophyta. Hence, EEA can be considered the prototype of a novel family of presumably cytoplasmic/nuclear proteins that are apparently ubiquitous in plants. Taking into account that some of these proteins are definitely stress related, the present identification of the EEA lectin domain might be a first step in the recognition of the involvement and importance of protein-glycoconjugate interactions in some essential cellular processes in Embryophyta.
18470484	Overexpression of a rice OsDREB1F gene increases salt, drought, and low temperature tolerance in both Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	DREB transcription factors play key roles in plant stress signalling transduction pathway, they can specifically bind to DRE/CRT element (G/ACCGAC) and activate the expression of many stress inducible genes. Here, a novel rice DREB transcription factor, OsDREB1F, was cloned and characterised via subtractive suppression hybridisation (SSH) from upland rice. Expression analysis revealed that OsDREB1F gene was induced by salt, drought, cold stresses, and also ABA application, but not by pathogen, wound, and H2O2. Subcellular localization results indicated that OsDREB1F localizes in nucleus. Yeast activity assay demonstrated that OsDREB1F gene encodes a transcription activator, and can specifically bind to DRE/CRT but not to ABRE element. Transgenic plants harbouring OsDREB1F gene led to enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and low temperature in both rice and Arabidopsis. The further characterisation of OsDREB1F-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed that, besides activating the expression of COR genes which contain DRE/CRT element in their upstream promoter regions, the expression of rd29B and RAB18 genes were also activated, suggested that OsDREB1F may also participate in ABA-dependent pathway.
18470504	Surveying expression level polymorphism and single-feature polymorphism in near-isogenic wheat lines differing for the Yr5 stripe rust resistance locus.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	DNA polymorphisms are valuable for several applications including genotyping, molecular mapping and marker-assisted selection. The 55 K Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip was used to survey expression level polymorphisms (ELPs) and single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) between two near-isogenic wheat genotypes (BC(7):F(4)) that differ for the Yr5 stripe rust resistance locus, with the objective of developing genetic markers linked to Yr5. Ninety-one probe sets showing ELPs and 118 SFP-containing probe sets were identified between isolines, of which just nine ELP probe sets also contained SFPs. The proportion of the transcriptome estimated to be variable between isolines from this analysis was 0.30% for the ELPs and 0.39% for the SFPs, which was highly similar to the theoretical genome difference between isolines of ~0.39%. Using wheat-rice synteny, both ELPs and SFPs mainly clustered on long arms of rice chromosomes four and seven, which are syntenous to wheat chromosomes 2L (Yr5 locus) and 2S, respectively. The strong physical correlation between the two types of polymorphism indicated that the ELPs may be regulated by cis-acting DNA polymorphisms. Twenty SFPs homologous to rice 4L were used to develop additional genetic markers for Yr5. Physical mapping of the probe sets containing SFPs to wheat chromosomes identified nine on the target chromosome 2BL, thus wheat-rice synteny greatly enhanced the selection of SFPs that were located on the desired wheat chromosome. Of these nine, four were converted into polymorphic cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers between Yr5 and yr5 isolines, and one was mapped within 5.3 cM of the Yr5 locus. This study represents the first array-based polymorphism survey in near-isogenic genotypes, and the results are applied to an agriculturally important trait.
18477473	Identification and characterization of three telomere repeat-binding factors in rice.	2008	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Telomeres consist of nucleoprotein complexes that protect chromosome end structures. Here, we describe three OsTRBF genes, encoding telomere repeat-binding factors of the single Myb histone family in rice. The predicted proteins contain a Myb DNA-binding motif and a linker histone H1/H5 domain in the N-terminal and central regions, respectively. The OsTRBF transcripts were constitutively detected in rice plants grown under greenhouse conditions. Gel retardation assays showed that these OsTRBF proteins bind specifically to the plant double-stranded telomeric sequence, TTTAGGG, with markedly different binding affinities as judged by their respective dissociation constants. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays indicated that both OsTRBF1 and OsTRBF2 interact with one another to form homo- and hetero-complexes, while OsTRBF3 appeared to act as a monomer. Our results suggest that OsTRBFs play combinatory roles in the function and structure of telomeres in rice.
18480059	Catalytic function of the PR-Set7 histone H4 lysine 20 monomethyltransferase is essential for mitotic entry and genomic stability.	2008	J Biol Chem	Histone-modifying enzymes play a critical role in modulating chromatin dynamics. In this report we demonstrate that one of these enzymes, PR-Set7, and its corresponding histone modification, the monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), display a distinct cell cycle profile in mammalian cells: low at G1, increased during late S phase and G2, and maximal from prometaphase to anaphase. The lack of PR-Set7 and monomethylated H4K20 resulted in a number of aberrant phenotypes in several different mammalian cell types. These include the inability of cells to progress past G2, global chromosome condensation failure, aberrant centrosome amplification, and substantial DNA damage. By employing a catalytically dead dominant negative PR-Set7 mutant, we discovered that its mono-methyltransferase activity was required to prevent these phenotypes. Importantly, we demonstrate that all of the aberrant phenotypes associated with the loss of PR-Set7 enzymatic function occur independently of p53. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PR-Set7 enzymatic activity is essential for mammalian cell cycle progression and for the maintenance of genomic stability, most likely by monomethylating histone H4K20. Our results predict that alterations of this pathway could result in gross chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy.
18481185	Gene expression analysis at the onset of aposporous apomixis in Paspalum notatum.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Apomixis is a route of asexual reproduction through seeds, that progresses in the absence of meiosis and fertilization to generate maternal clonal progenies. Gametophytic apomicts are usually polyploid and probably arose from sexual ancestors through a limited number of mutations in the female reproductive pathway. A differential display analysis was carried out on immature inflorescences of sexual and apomictic tetraploid genotypes of Paspalum notatum, in order to identify genes associated with the emergence of apospory. Analysis of approximately 10,000 transcripts led to the identification of 94 high-quality differentially expressed sequences. Assembling analysis, plus validation, rendered 65 candidate unigenes, organized as 14 contigs and 51 singletons. Thirty-four unigenes were isolated from apomictic plants and 31 from sexual ones. A total of 45 (69.2%) unigenes were functionally categorized. While several of the differentially expressed sequences appeared to be components of an extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) signal transduction cascade, others seemed to participate in a variety of central cellular processes like cell-cycle control, protein turnover, intercellular signalling, transposon activity, transcriptional regulation and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated biosynthesis. In silico mapping revealed that a particular group of five genes silenced in apomictic plants clustered in a rice genomic area syntenic with the region governing apospory in Paspalum notatum and Brachiaria brizantha. Two of these genes mapped within the set of apo-homologues in P. notatum. Four genes previously reported to be controlled by ploidy were identified among those expressed differentially between apomictic and sexual plants. In situ hybridization experiments were performed for selected clones.
18491141	Sequence and expression analysis of the thioredoxin protein gene family in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Thioredoxin (Trx) proteins play important biological functions in cells by changing redox via thioldisulfide exchange. This system is especially widespread in plants. Through database search, we identified 30 potential Trx protein-encoding genes (OsTrx) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). An analysis of the complete set of OsTrx proteins is presented here, including chromosomal location, conserved motifs, domain duplication, and phylogenetic relationships. Our findings suggest that the expansion of the Trx gene family in rice, in large part, occurred due to gene duplication. A comprehensive expression profile of Trx genes family was investigated by analyzing the signal data of this family extracted from the whole genome microarray analysis of Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97, two indica parents, and their hybrid Shanyou 63, using 27 different tissues representing the entire life cycle of rice. Results revealed specific expression of some members at germination transition as well as the 3-leaf stage during the vegetative growth phase of rice. OsTrx genes were also found to be differentially up- or down-regulated in rice seedlings subjected to treatments of phytohormones and light/dark conditions. The expression levels of the OsTrx genes in the different tissues and under different treatments were also checked by RT-PCR analysis. The identification of OsTrx genes showing differential expression in specific tissues among different genotypes or in response to different environmental cues could provide a new avenue for functional analyses in rice.
18492871	Dual effects of miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5/KLUH on plastochron length and organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2008	Plant Cell	Leaves of flowering plants are produced from the shoot apical meristem at regular intervals, with the time that elapses between the formation of two successive leaf primordia defining the plastochron. We have identified two genetic axes affecting plastochron length in Arabidopsis thaliana. One involves microRNA156 (miR156), which targets a series of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes. In situ hybridization studies and misexpression experiments demonstrate that miR156 is a quantitative, rather than spatial, modulator of SPL expression in leaf primordia and that SPL activity nonautonomously inhibits initiation of new leaves at the shoot apical meristem. The second axis is exemplified by a redundantly acting pair of cytochrome P450 genes, CYP78A5/KLUH and CYP78A7, which are likely orthologs of PLASTOCHRON1 of rice (Oryza sativa). Inactivation of CYP78A5, which is expressed at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem, accelerates the leaf initiation rate, whereas cyp78a5 cyp78a7 double mutants often die as embryos with supernumerary cotyledon primordia. The effects of both miR156-targeted SPL genes and CYP78A5 on organ size are correlated with changes in plastochron length, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism that links the rate at which leaves are produced to final leaf size.
18493037	Genomewide analysis of box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reveals an extensive organization into intronic gene clusters.	2008	Genetics	Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga, the lineage of which diverged from that of land plants >1 billion years ago. Using the powerful small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) mining platform to screen the C. reinhardtii genome, we identified 322 snoRNA genes grouped into 118 families. The 74 box C/D families can potentially guide methylation at 96 sites of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and snRNAs, and the 44 box H/ACA families can potentially guide pseudouridylation at 62 sites. Remarkably, 242 of the snoRNA genes are arranged into 76 clusters, of which 77% consist of homologous genes produced by small local tandem duplications. At least 70 snoRNA gene clusters are found within introns of protein-coding genes. Although not exhaustive, this analysis reveals that C. reinhardtii has the highest number of intronic snoRNA gene clusters among eukaryotes. The prevalence of intronic snoRNA gene clusters in C. reinhardtii is similar to that of rice but in contrast with the one-snoRNA-per-intron organization of vertebrates and fungi and with that of Arabidopsis thaliana in which only a few intronic snoRNA gene clusters were identified. This analysis of C. reinhardtii snoRNA gene organization shows the functional importance of introns in a single-celled organism and provides evolutionary insight into the origin of intron-encoded RNAs in the plant lineage.
18493049	Unique features of nuclear mRNA poly(A) signals and alternative polyadenylation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.	2008	Genetics	To understand nuclear mRNA polyadenylation mechanisms in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we generated a data set of 16,952 in silico-verified poly(A) sites from EST sequencing traces based on Chlamydomonas Genome Assembly v.3.1. Analysis of this data set revealed a unique and complex polyadenylation signal profile that is setting Chlamydomonas apart from other organisms. In contrast to the high-AU content in the 3'-UTRs of other organisms, Chlamydomonas shows a high-guanylate content that transits to high-cytidylate around the poly(A) site. The average length of the 3'-UTR is 595 nucleotides (nt), significantly longer than that of Arabidopsis and rice. The dominant poly(A) signal, UGUAA, was found in 52% of the near-upstream elements, and its occurrence may be positively correlated with higher gene expression levels. The UGUAA signal also exists in Arabidopsis and in some mammalian genes but mainly in the far-upstream elements, suggesting a shift in function. The C-rich region after poly(A) sites with unique signal elements is a characteristic downstream element that is lacking in higher plants. We also found a high level of alternative polyadenylation in the Chlamydomonas genome, with a range of up to 33% of the 4057 genes analyzed having at least two unique poly(A) sites and approximately 1% of these genes having poly(A) sites residing in predicted coding sequences, introns, and 5'-UTRs. These potentially contribute to transcriptome diversity and gene expression regulation.
18495384	Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analysis of the plant specific SBP-box transcription factor family.	2008	Gene	We made genome-wide analyses to explore the evolutionary process of the SBP-box gene family. We identified 120 SBP-box genes from nine species representing the main green plant lineages: green alga, moss, lycophyte, gymnosperm and angiosperm. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the protein sequences of the DNA-binding domain of SBP-box genes (SBP-domain). Our results revealed that all SBP-box genes of green alga clustered into a single clade (CR group), while all genes from land-plants fell into two distinct groups. Group I had a single copy in each species except for poplar while group II had several members in each species and can be divided into several subgroups. The SBP-domain encoded by all SBP-box genes possesses two zinc fingers. The C-terminal zinc finger of both group I and group II had the same C2HC motif while their N-terminal zinc finger showed different signatures, C4 in group I and C3H in group II. The patterns of exon-intron structure in Arabidopsis and rice SBP-box genes were consistent with the phylogenetic results. A target site of microRNA miR156 was highly conserved among land-plant SBP-box genes. Our results suggested that the SBP-box gene family might have originated from a common ancestor of green plants, followed by duplication and divergence in each lineage including exon-intron loss processes.
18496756	Functional analysis reveals pleiotropic effects of rice RING-H2 finger protein gene OsBIRF1 on regulation of growth and defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	RING finger proteins comprise a large family and play key roles in regulating growth/developmental processes, hormone signaling and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. A rice gene, OsBIRF1, encoding a putative RING-H2 finger protein, was cloned and identified. OsBIRF1 encodes a 396 amino acid protein belonging to the ATL family characterized by a conserved RING-H2 finger domain (C-X2-C-X15-C-X1-H-X2-H-X2-C-X10-C-X2-C), a transmembrane domain at the N-terminal, a basic amino acid rich region and a characteristic GLD region. Expression of OsBIRF1 was up-regulated in rice seedlings after treatment with benzothaidiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and jasmonic acid, and was induced differentially in incompatible but not compatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease. Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express OsBIRF1 exhibit enhanced disease resistance against tobacco mosaic virus and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and elevated expression levels of defense-related genes, e.g. PR-1, PR-2, PR-3 and PR-5. The OsBIRF1-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants show increased oxidative stress tolerance to exogenous treatment with methyl viologen and H2O2, and up-regulate expression of oxidative stress-related genes. Reduced ABA sensitivity in root elongation and increased drought tolerance in seed germination were also observed in OsBIRF1 transgenic tobacco plants. Furthermore, the transgenic tobacco plants show longer roots and higher plant heights as compared with the wild-type plants, suggesting that overexpression of OsBIRF1 promote plant growth. These results demonstrate that OsBIRF1 has pleiotropic effects on growth and defense response against multiple abiotic and biotic stresses.
18506581	Functional analysis of cotton orthologs of GA signal transduction factors GID1 and SLR1.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Gibberellic acid (GA) is both necessary and sufficient to promote fiber elongation in cultured fertilized ovules of the upland cotton variety Coker 312. This is likely due to the temporal and spatial regulation of GA biosynthesis, perception, and subsequent signal transduction that leads to alterations in gene expression and morphology. Our results indicate that the initiation of fiber elongation by the application of GA to cultured ovules corresponds with increased expression of genes that encode xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and expansin (EXP) that are involved in promoting cell elongation. To gain a better understanding of the GA signaling components in cotton, that lead to such changes in gene expression, two GA receptor genes (GhGID1a and GhGID1b) and two DELLA protein genes (GhSLR1a and GhSLR1b) that are orthologous to the rice GA receptor (GID1) and the rice DELLA gene (SLR1), respectively, were characterized. Similar to the GA biosynthetic genes, expression of GhGID1a and GhGID1b is under the negative regulation by GA while GA positively regulates GhSLR1a. Recombinant GST-GhGID1s showed GA-binding activity in vitro that was augmented in the presence of GhSLR1a, GhSLR1b, or rice SLR1, indicating complex formation between the receptors and repressor proteins. This was further supported by the GA-dependent interaction of these proteins in yeast cells. Ectopic expression of the GhGID1a in the rice gid1-3 mutant plants rescued the GA-insensitive dwarf phenotype, which demonstrates that it is a functional GA receptor. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GhSLR1b in wild type Arabidopsis led to reduced growth and upregulated expression of DELLA-responsive genes.
18508761	Multiple intrinsically disordered sequences alter DNA binding by the homeodomain of the Drosophila hox protein ultrabithorax.	2008	J Biol Chem	During animal development, distinct tissues, organs, and appendages are specified through differential gene transcription by Hox transcription factors. However, the conserved Hox homeodomains bind DNA with high affinity yet low specificity. We have therefore explored the structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Hox protein Ultrabithorax and the impact of its nonhomeodomain regions on DNA binding properties. Computational and experimental approaches identified several conserved, intrinsically disordered regions outside the homeodomain of Ultrabithorax that impact DNA binding by the homeodomain. Full-length Ultrabithorax bound to target DNA 2.5-fold weaker than its isolated homeodomain. Using N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants, we demonstrate that the YPWM region and the disordered microexons (termed the I1 region) inhibit DNA binding approximately 2-fold, whereas the disordered I2 region inhibits homeodomain-DNA interaction a further approximately 40-fold. Binding is restored almost to homeodomain affinity by the mostly disordered N-terminal 174 amino acids (R region) in a length-dependent manner. Both the I2 and R regions contain portions of the activation domain, functionally linking DNA binding and transcription regulation. Given that (i) the I1 region and a portion of the R region alter homeodomain-DNA binding as a function of pH and (ii) an internal deletion within I1 increases Ultrabithorax-DNA affinity, I1 must directly impact homeodomain-DNA interaction energetics. However, I2 appears to indirectly affect DNA binding in a manner countered by the N terminus. The amino acid sequences of I2 and much of the I1 and R regions vary significantly among Ultrabithorax orthologues, potentially diversifying Hox-DNA interactions.
18508959	Sequence analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome clones from the apospory-specific genomic region of Pennisetum and Cenchrus.	2008	Plant Physiol	Apomixis, asexual reproduction through seed, is widespread among angiosperm families. Gametophytic apomixis in Pennisetum squamulatum and Cenchrus ciliaris is controlled by the apospory-specific genomic region (ASGR), which is highly conserved and macrosyntenic between these species. Thirty-two ASGR bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) isolated from both species and one ASGR-recombining BAC from P. squamulatum, which together cover approximately 2.7 Mb of DNA, were used to investigate the genomic structure of this region. Phrap assembly of 4,521 high-quality reads generated 1,341 contiguous sequences (contigs; 730 from the ASGR and 30 from the ASGR-recombining BAC in P. squamulatum, plus 580 from the C. ciliaris ASGR). Contigs containing putative protein-coding regions unrelated to transposable elements were identified based on protein similarity after Basic Local Alignment Search Tool X analysis. These putative coding regions were further analyzed in silico with reference to the rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genomes using the resources at Gramene (www.gramene.org) and Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) and by hybridization against sorghum BAC filters. The ASGR sequences reveal that the ASGR (1) contains both gene-rich and gene-poor segments, (2) contains several genes that may play a role in apomictic development, (3) has many classes of transposable elements, and (4) does not exhibit large-scale synteny with either rice or sorghum genomes but does contain multiple regions of microsynteny with these species.
18511458	RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, OsXIP, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	OsXIP (Oryza sativa xylanase inhibitor protein) is a XIP-type xylanase inhibitor which was identified as a protein encoded by a wound stress-responsive gene in rice. Although the OsXIP gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant OsXIP had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and OsXIP-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of OsXIP. Analysis using an OsXIP-specific antibody revealed that OsXIP is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding. These results reinforced the possibility that OsXIP is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens.
18516584	A major locus expressed in the male gametophyte with incomplete penetrance is responsible for in situ gynogenesis in maize.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	In flowering plants, double fertilization occurs when the egg cell and the central cell are each fertilized by one sperm cell. In maize, some lines produce pollen capable of inducing in situ gynogenesis thereby leading to maternal haploids that originate exclusively from the female plant. In this paper, we present a genetic analysis of in situ gynogenesis in maize. Using a cross between non-inducing and inducing lines, we identified a major locus on maize chromosome 1 controlling in situ gynogenesis (ggi1, for gynogenesis inducer 1). Fine mapping of this locus was performed, and BAC physical contigs spanning the locus were identified using the rice genome as anchor. Genetic component analysis showed that (a) a segregation distortion against the inducer parent was present at this locus, (b) segregation resulted only from male deficiency and (c) there was a correlation between the rate of segregation distortion and the level of gynogenetic induction. In addition, our results showed that the genotype of the pollen determined its capacity to induce the formation of a haploid female embryo, indicating gametophytic expression of the character with incomplete penetrance. We propose the occurrence of a gametophytic-specific process which leads to segregation distortion at the ggi1 locus associated with gynogenetic induction with incomplete penetrance.
18522800	Sakuranetin induces adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells through enhanced expression of PPARgamma2.	2008	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Sakuranetin (5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone) belongs to the flavanone class of polyphenols predominantly known as phytoalexin in rice plant. In this study, we demonstrate that sakuranetin strongly induces differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as evidenced by increased triglyceride accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. In addition, even in the absence of adipogenic hormonal stimuli, sakuranetin strongly induced adipogenesis and expression of genes that are critical for the adipocytes phenotype. Time-course analyses indicated that sakuranetin induces PPARgamma2 expression without prior induction of C/EBPbeta, a transcriptional regulator of PPARgamma2 in adipogenesis. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the transcriptional factors GATA-2 and GATA-3 are known to down-regulate adipogenesis by direct binding to the C/EBPbeta protein and to the GATA-binding site on the PPARgamma2 promoter. We found that sakuranetin significantly reduced the expression of GATA-2. Moreover, we observed that sakuranetin stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest that sakuranetin may contribute to maintain glucose homeostasis in animals.
18522943	Catabolism of glutathione conjugates in Arabidopsis thaliana. Role in metabolic reactivation of the herbicide safener fenclorim.	2008	J Biol Chem	The safener fenclorim (4,6-dichloro-2-phenylpyrimidine) increases tolerance to chloroacetanilide herbicides in rice by enhancing the expression of detoxifying glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Fenclorim also enhances GSTs in Arabidopsis thaliana, and while investigating the functional significance of this induction in suspension cultures, we determined that these enzymes glutathionylated the safener. The resulting S-(fenclorim)-glutathione conjugate was sequentially processed to S-(fenclorim)-gamma-glutamyl-cysteine and S-(fenclorim)-cysteine (FC), the latter accumulating in both the cells and the medium. FC was then either catabolized to 4-chloro-6-(methylthio)-phenylpyrimidine (CMTP) or N-acylated with malonic acid. These cysteine derivatives had distinct fates, with the enzymes responsible for their formation being induced by fenclorim and FC. Fenclorim-N-malonylcysteine was formed from FC by the action of a malonyl-CoA-dependent N-malonyltransferase. A small proportion of the fenclorim-N-malonylcysteine then underwent decarboxylation to yield a putative S-fenclorim-N-acetylcysteine intermediate, which underwent a second round of GST-mediated S-glutathionylation and subsequent proteolytic processing. The formation of CMTP was catalyzed by the concerted action of a cysteine conjugate beta-lyase and an S-methyltransferase, with the two activities being coordinately regulated. Although the fenclorim conjugates tested showed little GST-inducing activity in Arabidopsis, the formation of CMTP resulted in metabolic reactivation, with the product showing good enhancing activity. In addition, CMTP induced GSTs and herbicide-safening activity in rice. The bioactivated CMTP was in turn glutathione-conjugated and processed to a malonyl cysteine derivative. These results reveal the surprisingly complex set of competing catabolic reactions acting on xenobiotics entering the S-glutathionylation pathway in plants, which can result in both detoxification and bioactivation.
18535011	Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the haploid liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L., an emerging model for plant biology.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has not been practical in pteridophytes, bryophytes and algae to date, although it is commonly used in model plants including Arabidopsis and rice. Here we present a rapid Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for the haploid liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L. using immature thalli developed from spores. Hundreds of hygromycin-resistant plants per sporangium were obtained by co-cultivation of immature thalli with Agrobacterium carrying the binary vector that contains a reporter, the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene with an intron, and a selection marker, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene. In this system, individual gemmae, which arise asexually from single initial cells, were analyzed as isogenic transformants. GUS activity staining showed that all hygromycin-resistant plants examined expressed the GUS transgene in planta. DNA analyses verified random integration of 1-5 copies of the intact T-DNA between the right and the left borders into the M. polymorpha genome. The efficient and rapid Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of M. polymorpha should provide molecular techniques to facilitate comparative genomics, taking advantage of this unique model plant that retains many features of the common ancestor of land plants.
18539606	Effects of polylinker uATGs on the function of grass HKT1 transporters expressed in yeast cells.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	HvHKT1 mediates K(+) or Na(+) uniport in yeast cells if the expression promoter is joined directly to the HvHKT1 cDNA, and Na(+)-K(+) symport if a 59 nucleotide polylinker is inserted. Our results show that three ATG triplets in the polylinker decreased the synthesis of the transporter and that the lower amount of transporter caused the functional change. With the rice HKT1 cDNA, the 59 nt polylinker changed the mode of Na(+) uptake from K(+)-insensitive to K(+)-inhibitable. These two modes of Na(+) uptake also occurred in rice plants.
18547394	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsCDase, a ceramidase enzyme from rice.	2008	Plant J	SUMMARY: Sphingolipids are a structurally diverse group of molecules based on long-chain sphingoid bases that are found in animal, fungal and plant cells. In contrast to the situation in animals and yeast, much less is known about the spectrum of sphingolipid species in plants and the roles they play in mediating cellular processes. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a plant ceramidase from rice (Oryza sativa spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare). Sequence analysis suggests that the rice ceramidase (OsCDase) is similar to mammalian neutral ceramidases. We demonstrate that OsCDase is a bona fide ceramidase by heterologous expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Deltaypc1Deltaydc1 that lacks the yeast ceramidases YPC1p and YDC1p. Biochemical characterization of OsCDase showed that it exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with optimum activity between pH 5.7 and 6.0. OsCDase activity was enhanced in the presence of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+) and Zn(2+), but inhibited in the presence of Fe(2+). OsCDase appears to use ceramide instead of phytoceramide as a substrate. Subcellular localization showed that OsCDase is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, suggesting that these organelles are sites of ceramide metabolism in plants.
18553067	The use of high resolution melting (HRM) to map single nucleotide polymorphism markers linked to a covered smut resistance gene in barley.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Using an established genetic map, a single gene conditioning covered smut resistance, Ruh.7H, was mapped to the telomere region of chromosome 7HS in an Alexis/Sloop doubled haploid barley population. The closest marker to Ruh.7H, abg704 was 7.5 cM away. Thirteen loci on the distal end of 7HS with potential to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by applying a comparative genomics approach using rice sequence data. Of these, one locus produced polymorphic co-dominant bands of different size while two further loci contained SNPs that were identified using the recently developed high resolution melting (HRM) technique. Two of these markers flanked Ruh.7H with the proximal marker located 3.8 cM and the distal marker 2.7 cM away. This is the first report on the application of the HRM technique to SNP detection and to rapid scoring of known cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers in plants. This simple, precise post-PCR technique should find widespread use in the fine-mapping of genetic regions of interest in complex cereal and other plant genomes.
18553105	Molecular tagging of the Bph1 locus for resistance to brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) through representational difference analysis.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	During brown planthopper (BPH) feeding on rice plants, we employed a modified representational difference analysis (RDA) method to detect rare transcripts among those differentially expressed in SNBC61, a BPH resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Bph1 resistance gene. This identified 3 RDA clones: OsBphi237, OsBphi252 and OsBphi262. DNA gel-blot analysis revealed that the loci of the RDA clones in SNBC61 corresponded to the alleles of the BPH resistant donor Samgangbyeo. Expression analysis indicated that the RDA genes were up-regulated in SNBC61 during BPH feeding. Interestingly, analysis of 64 SNBC NILs, derived from backcrosses of Samgangbyeo with a BPH susceptible Nagdongbyeo, using a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker indicated that OsBphi252, which encodes a putative lipoxygenase (LOX), co-segregates with BPH resistance. Our results suggest that OsBphi252 is tightly linked to Bph1, and may be useful in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for resistance to BPH.
18564381	OsRecQ1, a QDE-3 homologue in rice, is required for RNA silencing induced by particle bombardment for inverted repeat DNA, but not for double-stranded RNA.	2008	Plant J	Based on the nucleotide sequence of QDE-3 in Neurospora crassa, which is involved in RNA silencing, rice (Oryza sativa) mutant lines disrupted by the insertion of the rice retrotransposon Tos17 were selected. Homozygous individuals from the M(1) and M(2) generations were screened and used for further analyses. The expression of the gene was not detected in leaves or calli of the mutant lines, in contrast to the wild type (WT). Induction of RNA silencing by particle bombardment was performed to investigate any effects of the OsRecQ1 gene on RNA silencing with silencing inducers of the GFP (green fluorescence protein)/GUS (beta-glucuronidase) gene in the mutant lines. The results showed that OsRecQ1 is required for RNA silencing induced by particle bombardment for inverted-repeat DNA, but not for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The levels of transcripts from inverted-repeat DNA were much lower in the mutant lines than those in the WT. Furthermore, no effects were observed in the accumulation of endogenous microRNAs (miR171 and miR156) and the production of the short interspersed nuclear element retroelement by small interfering RNA. On the basis of these results, we propose that OsRecQ1 may participate in the process that allows inverted repeat DNA to be transcribed into dsRNA, which can trigger RNA silencing.
18567825	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice.	2008	Plant Physiol	Members of the Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (Class III HD-Zip) gene family are central regulators of crucial aspects of plant development. To better understand the roles of five Class III HD-Zip genes in rice (Oryza sativa) development, we investigated their expression patterns, ectopic expression phenotypes, and auxin responsiveness. Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles. In contrast, expression of OSHB5 was observed only in phloem tissue. Plants ectopically expressing microRNA166-resistant versions of the OSHB3 gene exhibited severe defects, including the ectopic production of leaf margins, shoots, and radialized leaves. The treatment of seedlings with auxin quickly induced ectopic OSHB3 expression in the entire region of the SAM, but not in other tissues. Furthermore, this ectopic expression of OSHB3 was correlated with leaf initiation defects. Our findings suggest that rice Class III HD-Zip genes have conserved functions with their homologs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but have also acquired specific developmental roles in grasses or monocots. In addition, some Class III HD-Zip genes may regulate the leaf initiation process in the SAM in an auxin-dependent manner.
18571878	A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress.	2008	Gene	Serine carboxypeptidase-like proteins (SCPLs) comprise a large family of protein hydrolyzing enzymes that play roles in multiple cellular processes. During the course of study aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of induced immunity in rice, a gene, OsBISCPL1, encoding a putative SCPL, was isolated and identified. OsBISCPL1 contains a conserved peptidase S10 domain, serine active site and a signal peptide at N-terminus. OsBISCPL1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice, including roots, stems, leaves and spikes. Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of OsBISCPL1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicated that the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Alternaria brassicicola. Expression levels of defense-related genes, e.g. PR1, PR2, PR5 and PDF1.2, were constitutively up-regulated in transgenic plants as compared with those in wild-type plants. Furthermore, the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes. The results suggest that the OsBISCPL1 may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
18579782	Structurally different alleles of the ath-MIR824 microRNA precursor are maintained at high frequency in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In plants and animals, gene expression can be down-regulated at the posttranscriptional level by microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small endogenous RNA. Comparative analysis of miRNA content across species indicates continuous birth and death of these loci in the course of evolution. However, little is known about the microevolutionary dynamics of these genetic elements, especially in plants. In this article we examine polymorphism at two miRNA-encoding loci in Arabidopsis thaliana, miR856 and miR824, which are not found in rice or poplar. We compare their diversity to other miRNA-encoding loci conserved across distant taxa. We find that levels of variation vary significantly across loci and that the two recently derived loci harbor patterns of diversity deviating from neutrality. miRNA miR856 shows a weak signature of a selective sweep whereas miR824 displays signs of balancing selection. A detailed examination of structural variation among alleles found at the miR824-encoding locus suggests nonrandom evolution of a thermoresistant substructure in the precursor. Expression analysis of pre-miR824 and its target, AGL16, indicates that these structural differences likely impact the processing of mature miR824. Our work highlights the relevance of RNA structure in precursor sequence evolution, suggesting that the evolutionary dynamics of miRNA-encoding loci is more complex than suggested by the constraints exerted on the interaction between mature miRNA fragments and their target exon.
18586868	SPIN1, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, is involved in flowering time control in rice.	2008	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) E3 ligase SPOTTED LEAF11 (SPL11) negatively regulates programmed cell death and disease resistance. We demonstrate here that SPL11 also regulates flowering via interaction with SPIN1 (for SPL11-interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member. SPIN1 binds RNA and DNA in vitro and interacts with SPL11 in the nucleus. Spl11 mutants have delayed flowering under long-day conditions. Spin1 overexpression causes late flowering independently of daylength; expression analyses of flowering marker genes in these lines suggested that SPIN1 represses flowering by downregulating the flowering promoter gene Heading date3a (Hd3a) via Hd1-dependent mechanisms in short days and by targeting Hd1-independent factors in long days. Both Spin1 and Spl11 are regulated diurnally in opposing phases. SPL11 negatively regulates Spin1 transcript levels, while SPIN1 also affects Spl11 expression. Moreover, we show that coincidence of high accumulation of Spin1 mRNA with the light in the morning and early evening is needed to repress flowering. SPIN1 is monoubiquitinated by SPL11, suggesting that it is not targeted for degradation. Our data are consistent with a model in which SPIN1 acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by SPL11, possibly via ubiquitination.
18587653	Improvement of recombinant hGM-CSF production by suppression of cysteine proteinase gene expression using RNA interference in a transgenic rice culture.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Recombinant proteins have been previously synthesized in a transgenic rice cell suspension culture system with the rice amylase 3D promoter, which can be induced via sugar starvation. However, the secreted recombinant proteins have been shown to be rapidly decreased as the result of proteolytic degradation occurring during prolonged incubation. The secreted proteases were identified via two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI/Q-TOF mass spectrometry analyses. The internal amino acid sequences of 8 of 37 spots corresponded to cysteine proteinase (CysP), which is encoded for by Rep1 and EP3A. This result shows that CysP is a major secreted protease in rice cell suspension cultures following induction via sugar starvation. Intron-containing self-complementary hairpin RNA (ihpRNA)-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) was applied to suppress the expression of CysP in rice cell suspension cultures. The reduction of rice CysP mRNA and the detection of siRNA specific to CysP, an initiator of RNAi, were verified via Northern blot analysis and RNase protection assays, respectively, thereby indicating that PTGS operated successfully in this system. The analysis of total secreted protease and CysP activities evidenced lower activity than was observed with the wild-type. Furthermore, suspension cultures of rice cells transformed with both hGM-CSF and the gene expressing the ihpRNA of CysP evidenced a reduction in total protease and CysP activities, and an up to 1.9-fold improvement in hGM-CSF production as compared to that observed in a rice cell line expressing hGM-CSF only. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the suppression of CysP via RNA interference to reduce protease activity and to increase target protein accumulation in rice cell suspension cultures.
18593744	A transposon, Ping, is integrated into intron 4 of the DROOPING LEAF gene of rice, weakly reducing its expression and causing a mild drooping leaf phenotype.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	The YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) regulates midrib formation in the leaves and carpel specification in the flowers of rice (Oryza sativa L). We found a new dl allele (dl-5) that caused a mild phenotype in the descendants of a mutable line, IM294. In plants homozygous for this allele, midrib structures were formed but their sizes were reduced. Molecular analysis revealed that a transposon, Ping, was inserted in the fourth intron of DL. Together with mPing and Pong, Ping is a member of a transposon family that was first identified as a group of active transposable elements in rice. Our finding of the Ping insertion in the DL gene is a first indication that Ping is active in planta, and that it can be transposed and integrated in a new locus. Ping seems to be still active because it was excised from intron 4 of DL at a relatively high frequency in rice calli. Real-time PCR analysis and in situ hybridization indicated that DL transcript levels were reduced in dl-5 without alterations in the spatial expression pattern of the DL gene. The reduction of DL expression may be due to inefficient splicing of the large intron caused by Ping insertion. By comparing the expression levels of DL and leaf phenotypes in the dl mutants with different severities, we confirmed our previous hypothesis that DL promotes cell proliferation in the central region of leaf primordia, and that this cell proliferation is critical for midrib formation in the mature leaves.
18596062	The SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 gene coordinates leaf domain development along the central-marginal axis in rice.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	We describe how rice leaves are regionalized and regulated along the central-marginal axis. The shoot organization2 (sho2) mutant, a weak allele of SHOOTLESS4 that is a ZIPPY/ARGONAUTE7 homolog in rice, shows a variety of leaf abnormalities; filamentous leaves, bi- or trifurcated leaves, separation of the filamentous structure from the leaf blade or deletion of the margin. All of these phenotypes can be interpreted as combinatorial defects in the growth of the central, lateral and marginal domains along the central-marginal axis, on the condition that the growth of the central domain is predominant. The leaf founder cells for the lateral and marginal domains are recruited normally in sho2, indicating that sho2 is defective in the growth of leaf domains after the founder cells are recruited. The expression pattern of SHO2 in the outer layer of the shoot apical meristem and the adaxial surface of the leaf, as well as the altered expression of HD-ZIP III and ETTIN homologs in the central domain of sho2 leaves, suggest that normal development of the central domain is a prerequisite for the synchronous growth of the three domains. This synchrony is thought to be mediated by a small interfering RNA-dependent process.
18614707	A novel type of thioredoxin dedicated to symbiosis in legumes.	2008	Plant Physiol	Thioredoxins (Trxs) constitute a family of small proteins in plants. This family has been extensively characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which contains six different Trx types: f, m, x, and y in chloroplasts, o in mitochondria, and h mainly in cytosol. A detailed study of this family in the model legume Medicago truncatula, realized here, has established the existence of two isoforms that do not belong to any of the types previously described. As no possible orthologs were further found in either rice (Oryza sativa) or poplar (Populus spp.), these novel isoforms may be specific for legumes. Nevertheless, on the basis of protein sequence and gene structure, they are both related to Trxs m and probably have evolved from Trxs m after the divergence of the higher plant families. They have redox potential values similar to those of the classical Trxs, and one of them can act as a substrate for the M. truncatula NADP-Trx reductase A. However, they differ from classical Trxs in that they possess an atypical putative catalytic site and lack disulfide reductase activity with insulin. Another important feature is the presence in both proteins of an N-terminal extension containing a putative signal peptide that targets them to the endoplasmic reticulum, as demonstrated by their transient expression in fusion with the green fluorescent protein in M. truncatula or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. According to their pattern of expression, these novel isoforms function specifically in symbiotic interactions in legumes. They were therefore given the name of Trxs s, s for symbiosis.
18615082	Preseismic velocity changes observed from active source monitoring at the Parkfield SAFOD drill site.	2008	Nature	Measuring stress changes within seismically active fault zones has been a long-sought goal of seismology. One approach is to exploit the stress dependence of seismic wave velocity, and we have investigated this in an active source cross-well experiment at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) drill site. Here we show that stress changes are indeed measurable using this technique. Over a two-month period, we observed an excellent anti-correlation between changes in the time required for a shear wave to travel through the rock along a fixed pathway (a few microseconds) and variations in barometric pressure. We also observed two large excursions in the travel-time data that are coincident with two earthquakes that are among those predicted to produce the largest coseismic stress changes at SAFOD. The two excursions started approximately 10 and 2 hours before the events, respectively, suggesting that they may be related to pre-rupture stress induced changes in crack properties, as observed in early laboratory studies.
18626020	Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide. Human arsenic intake from rice consumption can be substantial because rice is particularly efficient in assimilating arsenic from paddy soils, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Here we report that two different types of transporters mediate transport of arsenite, the predominant form of arsenic in paddy soil, from the external medium to the xylem. Transporters belonging to the NIP subfamily of aquaporins in rice are permeable to arsenite but not to arsenate. Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety.
18626624	Development of microsatellite markers specific for the short arm of rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome 1.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	We developed 74 microsatellite marker primer pairs yielding 76 polymorphic loci, specific for the short arm of rye chromosome 1R (1RS) in wheat background. Four libraries enriched for microsatellite motifs AG, AAG, AC and AAC were constructed from DNA of flow-sorted 1RS chromosomes and 1,290 clones were sequenced. Additionally, 2,778 BAC-end-sequences from a 1RS specific BAC library were used for microsatellite screening and marker development. From 724 designed primer pairs, 119 produced 1RS specific bands and 74 of them showed polymorphism in a set of ten rye genotypes. We show that this high attrition rate was due to the highly repetitive nature of the rye genome consisting of a large number of transposable elements. We mapped the 76 polymorphic loci physically into three regions (bins) on 1RS; 29, 30 and 17 loci were assigned to the distal, intercalary and proximal regions of the 1RS arm, respectively. The average polymorphism information content increases with distance from the centromere, which could be due to an increased recombination rate along the chromosome arm toward's the telomere. Additionally, we demonstrate, using the data of the whole rice genome, that the intra-genomic length variation of microsatellites correlates (r = 0.87) with microsatellite polymorphism. Based on these results we suggest that an analysis of the microsatellite length variation is conducted for each species prior to microsatellite development, provided that sufficient sequence information is available. This will allow to selectively design microsatellite markers for motifs likely to yield a high level of polymorphism.
18632585	Two isozymes of particulate methane monooxygenase with different methane oxidation kinetics are found in Methylocystis sp. strain SC2.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) attenuate methane emission from major sources, such as wetlands, rice paddies, and landfills, and constitute the only biological sink for atmospheric methane in upland soils. Their key enzyme is particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), which converts methane to methanol. It has long been believed that methane at the trace atmospheric mixing ratio of 1.75 parts per million by volume (ppmv) is not oxidized by the methanotrophs cultured to date, but rather only by some uncultured methanotrophs, and that type I and type II methanotrophs contain a single type of pMMO. Here, we show that the type II methanotroph Methylocystis sp. strain SC2 possesses two pMMO isozymes with different methane oxidation kinetics. The pmoCAB1 genes encoding the known type of pMMO (pMMO1) are expressed and pMMO1 oxidizes methane only at mixing ratios >600 ppmv. The pmoCAB2 genes encoding pMMO2, in contrast, are constitutively expressed, and pMMO2 oxidizes methane at lower mixing ratios, even at the trace level of atmospheric methane. Wild-type strain SC2 and mutants expressing pmoCAB2 but defective in pmoCAB1 consumed atmospheric methane for >3 months. Growth occurred at 10-100 ppmv methane. Most type II but no type I methanotrophs possess the pmoCAB2 genes. The apparent K(m) of pMMO2 (0.11 muM) in strain SC2 corresponds well with the K(m(app)) values for methane oxidation measured in soils that consume atmospheric methane, thereby explaining why these soils are dominated by type II methanotrophs, and some by Methylocystis spp., in particular. These findings change our concept of methanotroph ecology.
18632665	The human escort protein Hep binds to the ATPase domain of mitochondrial hsp70 and regulates ATP hydrolysis.	2008	J Biol Chem	Hsp70 escort proteins (Hep) have been implicated as essential for maintaining the function of yeast mitochondrial hsp70 molecular chaperones (mtHsp70), but the role that escort proteins play in regulating mammalian chaperone folding and function has not been established. We present evidence that human mtHsp70 exhibits limited solubility due to aggregation mediated by its ATPase domain and show that human Hep directly enhances chaperone solubility through interactions with this domain. In the absence of Hep, mtHsp70 was insoluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, as was its isolated ATPase domain and a chimera having this domain fused to the peptide-binding domain of HscA, a soluble monomeric chaperone. In contrast, these proteins all exhibited increased solubility when expressed in the presence of Hep. In vitro studies further revealed that purified Hep regulates the interaction of mtHsp70 with nucleotides. Full-length mtHsp70 exhibited slow intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity (6.8+/-0.2 x 10(-4) s(-1)) at 25 degrees C, which was stimulated up to 49-fold by Hep. Hep also stimulated the activity of the isolated ATPase domain, albeit to a lower maximal extent (11.5-fold). In addition, gel-filtration studies showed that formation of chaperone-escort protein complexes inhibited mtHsp70 self-association, and they revealed that Hep binding to full-length mtHsp70 and its isolated ATPase domain is strongest in the absence of nucleotides. These findings provide evidence that metazoan escort proteins regulate the catalytic activity and solubility of their cognate chaperones, and they indicate that both forms of regulation arise from interactions with the mtHsp70 ATPase domain.
18633717	Amylase gene silencing by RNA interference improves recombinant hGM-CSF production in rice suspension culture.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	A rice cell suspension culture system with the Ramy3D promoter, which is induced by sucrose starvation, has been previously utilized to produce large quantities of recombinant proteins. Although this expression system was reported previously to generate a good yield of recombinant hGM-CSF in transgenic rice cell suspension culture, rice alpha-amylase was a dominant protein, with 43% of total secreted proteins and an obstacle to the production and purification of secreted recombinant proteins in a rice cell suspension culture. In this study, an intron-containing self-complementary hairpin RNA (ihpRNA)-mediated post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) strategy for the rice alpha-amylase gene was applied in order to overcome this problem in rice cell suspension culture systems. The reduction of the mRNA level of the rice alpha-amylase gene was verified via Northern blot analysis and siRNA, an initiator of RNA interference, was detected via an RNase protection assay. The amount of rice alpha-amylase in the culture medium was reduced to 8.2% as compared to that of the wild-type. A transgenic rice cell suspension culture expressing both the hGM-CSF and ihpRNA of the rice alpha-amylase gene demonstrated that the quantity of rice alpha-amylase was reduced to 22% and that the accumulation of hGM-CSF increased by 1.9-fold as compared to that in the transgenic cell line expressing hGM-CSF only. These results indicated that RNAi technology should be of great utility for suppressing undesirable genes, and should improve accumulation and facilitate the purification of secreted recombinant proteins in rice cell suspension cultures.
18657232	Peroxisomal Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerases and evolution of cytosolic paralogues in embryophytes.	2008	Plant J	Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerase (ECI) is an enzyme that participates in the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids through the beta-oxidation cycle. Three genes encoding Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerases and named AtECI1, AtECI2 and AtECI3 have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. When expressed heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all three ECI proteins were targeted to the peroxisomes and enabled the yeast Deltaeci1 mutant to degrade 10Z-heptadecenoic acid, demonstrating Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerase activity in vivo. Fusion proteins between yellow fluorescent protein and AtECI1 or AtECI2 were targeted to the peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis root cells, but a similar fusion protein with AtECI3 remained in the cytosol for both tissues. AtECI3 targeting to peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae was dependent on yeast PEX5, while expression of Arabidopsis PEX5 in yeast failed to target AtECI3 to peroxisomes. AtECI2 and AtECI3 are tandem duplicated genes and show a high level of amino acid conservation, except at the C-terminus; AtECI2 ends with the well conserved peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1) terminal tripeptide PKL, while AtECI3 possesses a divergent HNL terminal tripeptide. Evolutionary analysis of ECI genes in plants revealed several independent duplication events, with duplications occurring in rice and Medicago truncatula, generating homologues with divergent C-termini and no recognizable PTS1. All plant ECI genes analyzed, including AtECI3, are under negative purifying selection, implying functionality of the cytosolic AtECI3. Analysis of the mammalian and fungal genomes failed to identify cytosolic variants of the Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerase, indicating that evolution of cytosolic Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl CoA isomerases is restricted to the plant kingdom.
18670134	New SINE families from rice, OsSN, with poly(A) at the 3' ends.	2008	Genes Genet Syst	A database search of the sequences flanking a member of rice retrotransposon RIRE7 revealed that a 298-bp sequence in the region downstream of the member is a repetitive sequence interspersed in the genome of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. Most of the repetitive sequences were flanked by a direct repeat of a target-site sequence, about 14 bp in length. The consensus sequence, 293 bp in length, had no regions encoding any proteins but had sequence motifs of an internal promoter of RNA polymerase III. These indicate that the sequence is a retroposon SINE, designated OsSN1 (Oryza sativa SINE1). OsSN1 is a new rice SINE, because it has no homology with any of the three p-SINE families previously identified from rice, and because it has a stretch of A at the 3' end, unlike p-SINE and any other Gramineae SINEs which have a stretch of T at the 3' end. The Nipponbare genome was found to have many members related to OsSN1, forming two additional new SINE families (designated OsSN2 and OsSN3). OsSN2 and OsSN3 are highly homologous to the 3' and 5' regions of OsSN1, respectively. This suggests that OsSN1 has a mosaic structure, which is generated by sequence exchange (or shuffling) between ancestral OsSN2 and OsSN3. Despite the absence of homology in the 3' regions between OsSN1 (or OsSN2) and OsSN3, a sequence, 5'-TTCTC-3', is commonly present in the region preceding the A stretch at the 3' end. This sequence together with the A stretch and a stem-loop structure found in the region near the A stretch are assumed to be important for retroposition. OsSN members were present in strains of Oryza species, as were p-SINE members. Some of the members showed insertion polymorphism at the respective loci among the rice strains. p-SINE had such polymorphic members, which are useful for classification and phylogenetic analysis of various strains of Oryza species. The polymorphic members of OsSN were more frequently found than those of p-SINE, and therefore, such members are likely to be useful for extensive taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on various rice strains.
18670140	Identification of small RNAs in late developmental stage of rice anthers.	2008	Genes Genet Syst	Small RNAs including microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are known as repressors of gene expression. There are many plant proteins involved in small RNA-mediated gene silencing, such as Dicer ribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, most of these proteins have been reported to be absent in the late developmental stage of the plant male gamete, pollen. In order to clarify the existence of the small RNAs during maturation of pollen, we cloned and sequenced small RNAs from rice anthers including tricellular pollen. From fifty six candidates of small RNAs, we identified two known miRNAs (miR166 and miR167), eight potential miRNAs, and ten putative heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs). RNA gel blot analyses clearly showed that miR166 and miR167 were accumulated in the uninuclear pollen stage of anther development and remained until the tricellular pollen stage. Our cloning and RNA gel blot analyses of small RNAs led us to propose a possible function of small RNA-mediated gene regulation for the development of male gametes in rice.
17570562	Induction of a polyubiquitin gene promoter by dehydration stresses in transformed rice cells.	2008	J Plant Physiol	The expression of the maize polyubiquitin gene promoter UBI1 in rice cells has been used to study the involvement of ubiquitin in cell protection responses to dehydration caused by osmotic, saline or freezing stress. The effect of these stresses on UBI1 activity was investigated by the use of stably transformed rice calli (UBI1:GUS), as well as by transient expression experiments performed with cell lines with high or low tolerance to each type of stress. The theoretical analysis of the UBI1 promoter shows several putative stress-regulated boxes that could account for the stress-related UBI1 induction pattern described in this work. We suggest that the study of the differential UBI1 promoter-driven expression in rice cell lines with different level of tolerance to stress might be useful to elucidate complex signal transduction pathways in response to dehydration stresses in monocots.
17765359	Cutin monomer induces expression of the rice OsLTP5 lipid transfer protein gene.	2008	J Plant Physiol	Treatment with the cutin monomer 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (HPA), a major component of cutin, elicited the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rice leaves and induced the expression of the lipid transfer protein gene OsLTP5. Treatment with HPA also induced expression of OsLTP1, OsLTP2, and the pathogen-related PR-10 genes to a lesser extent. The OsLTP5 transcript was expressed prominently in stems and flowers, but was barely detectable in leaves. Expression of OsLTP5 was induced in shoots in response to ABA and salicylic acid. It is proposed that HPA is perceived by rice as a signal, inducing defense reactions.
18210155	Identification and characterization of a gibberellin-regulated protein, which is ASR5, in the basal region of rice leaf sheaths.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Gibberellins (GAs) regulate growth and development in higher plants. To identify GA-regulated proteins during rice leaf sheath elongation, a proteomic approach was used. Proteins from the basal region of leaf sheath in rice seedling treated with GA(3) were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. The levels of abscisic acid-stress-ripening-inducible 5 protein (ASR5), elongation factor-1 beta, translationally controlled tumor protein, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and a novel protein increased; whereas the level of RuBisCO subunit binding-protein decreased by GA(3) treatment. ASR5 out of these six proteins was significantly regulated by GA(3) at the protein level but not at the mRNA level in the basal region of leaf sheaths. Since this protein is regulated not only by abscisic acid but also by GA(3), these results indicate that ASR5 might be involved in plant growth in addition to stress in the basal regions of leaf sheaths.
18219493	SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Sce) and FK506-binding protein (FKBP) encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) genes: genome-wide analysis, expression studies and evidence for their involvement in abiotic stress response.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	We report an in-depth characterization of two major stress proteins namely SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Sce) and peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sce mediates addition of SUMO group to various cell proteins, through process referred to as SUMOylation. Rice nuclear genome has two putative genes encoding the Sce protein (OsSce1 and OsSce2). PCR-amplified full-length OsSce1 cDNA functionally complemented the growth defect in yeast cells lacking the equivalent Ubc9 protein (ScDeltaubc9). RT-PCR analysis showed that transcript levels of OsSce1 and OsSce2 in rice seedlings were regulated by temperature stress. OsSce1 protein was localized to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells as evidenced by the transient GFP expression analysis following micro-projectile gun-based shooting of an OsSce1-GFP fusion construct. PPIase proteins assist molecular chaperones in reactions associated with protein folding and protein transport across membrane. There are 23 putative genes encoding for FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs; specific class of PPIase) in rice genome. OsFKBP20 cDNA was isolated as a stress-inducible EST clone. Largest ORF of 561 bases in OsFKBP20 showed characteristic FK506-binding domain at N-terminus and a coiled-coil motif at C-terminus. RNA expression analysis indicated that OsFKBP20 transcript is heat-inducible. OsFKBP20 over-expression in yeast endowed capacity of high temperature tolerance to yeast cells. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that OsSce1 protein physically interacts with the OsFKBP20 protein. It is thus proposed that OsSce1 and OsFKBP20 proteins in concert mediate the stress response of rice plants.
18320227	Gene expression enhancement mediated by the 5' UTR intron of the rice rubi3 gene varied remarkably among tissues in transgenic rice plants.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Introns are important sequence elements that modulate the expression of genes. Using the GUS reporter gene driven by the promoter of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) polyubiquitin rubi3 gene, we investigated the effects of the 5' UTR intron of the rubi3 gene and the 5' terminal 27 bp of the rubi3 coding sequence on gene expression in stably transformed rice plants. While the intron enhanced GUS gene expression, the 27-bp fused to the GUS coding sequence further augmented GUS expression level, with both varying among different tissues. The intron elevated GUS gene expression mainly at mRNA accumulation level, but also stimulated enhancement at translational level. The enhancement on mRNA accumulation, as determined by realtime quantitative RT-PCR, varied remarkably with tissue type. The augmentation by the intron at translational level also differed by tissue type, but to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the 27-bp fusion further boosted GUS protein yield without affecting mRNA accumulation level, indicating stimulation at translation level, which was also affected by tissue type. The research revealed substantial variation in the magnitudes of intron-mediated enhancement of gene expression (IME) among tissues in rice plants and the importance of using transgenic plants for IME studies.
18308761	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Causes of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants have been studied for two decades, and mitochondrial chimeric genes have been predicted to induce CMS. However, it is unclear what happens after CMS-associated proteins accumulate in mitochondria. In our previous study of microarray analysis, we found that 140 genes are aberrantly regulated in anthers of CW-type CMS of rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the present study, we investigated DCW11, one of the down-regulated genes in CW-CMS encoding a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C). DCW11 mRNA was preferentially expressed in anthers, with the highest expression in mature pollen. As predicted by the N-terminal sequence, DCW11 signal peptide-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in mitochondria. Knockdown of DCW11 in wild-type rice by RNA interference caused a major loss of seed-set fertility, without visible defect in pollen development. Since this knockdown phenotype resembled that of CW-CMS, we concluded that the down-regulation of DCW11 is correlated with CW-CMS. This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines. Down-regulation of DCW11 and up-regulation of AOX1a were also observed in two other types of rice CMS. Our result indicates that DCW11 could play a role as a mitochondrial signal transduction mediator in pollen germination.
18319396	Promoter-proximal introns in Arabidopsis thaliana are enriched in dispersed signals that elevate gene expression.	2008	Plant Cell	Introns that elevate mRNA accumulation have been found in a wide range of eukaryotes. However, not all introns affect gene expression, and direct testing is currently the only way to identify stimulatory introns. Our genome-wide analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that promoter-proximal introns as a group are compositionally distinct from distal introns and that the degree to which an individual intron matches the promoter-proximal intron profile is a strong predictor of its ability to increase expression. We found that the sequences responsible for elevating expression are dispersed throughout an enhancing intron, as is a candidate motif that is overrepresented in first introns and whose occurrence in tested introns is proportional to its effect on expression. The signals responsible for intron-mediated enhancement are apparently conserved between Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) despite the large evolutionary distance separating these plants.
18182026	Inactivation of the UGPase1 gene causes genic male sterility and endosperm chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Plant J	A rice genic male-sterility gene ms-h is recessive and has a pleiotropic effect on the chalky endosperm. After fine mapping, nucleotide sequencing analysis of the ms-h gene revealed a single nucleotide substitution at the 3'-splice junction of the 14th intron of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 1 (UGPase1; EC2.7.7.9) gene, which causes the expression of two mature transcripts with abnormal sizes caused by the aberrant splicing. An in vitro functional assay showed that both proteins encoded by the two abnormal transcripts have no UGPase activity. The suppression of UGPase by the introduction of a UGPase1-RNAi construct in wild-type plants nearly eliminated seed set because of the male defect, with developmental retardation similar to the ms-h mutant phenotype, whereas overexpression of UGPase1 in ms-h mutant plants restored male fertility and the transformants produced T(1) seeds that segregated into normal and chalky endosperms. In addition, both phenotypes were co-segregated with the UGPase1 transgene in segregating T(1) plants, which demonstrates that UGPase1 has functional roles in both male sterility and the development of a chalky endosperm. Our results suggest that UGPase1 plays a key role in pollen development as well as seed carbohydrate metabolism.
18208517	Reduced activity of Arabidopsis thaliana HMT2, a methionine biosynthetic enzyme, increases seed methionine content.	2008	Plant J	In the S-methylmethionine cycle of plants, homocysteine methyltransferase (HMT) catalyzes the formation of two molecules of methionine from homocysteine and S-methylmethionine, and methionine methyltransferase (MMT) catalyzes the formation of methionine from S-methylmethionine using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group donor. Somewhat surprisingly, two independently isolated knockdown mutations of HMT2 (At3g63250), one of three Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding homocysteine methyltransferase, increased free methionine abundance in seeds. Crosses and flower stalk grafting experiments demonstrate that the maternal genotype at the top of the flower stalk determines the seed S-methylmethionine and methionine phenotype of hmt2 mutants. Uptake, transport and inter-conversion of [(13)C]S-methylmethionine and [(13)C]methionine in hmt2, mmt and wild-type plants show that S-methylmethionine is a non-essential intermediate in the movement of methionine from vegetative tissue to the seeds. Together, these results support a model whereby elevated S-methylmethionine in hmt2 vegetative tissue is transported to seeds and either directly or indirectly results in the biosynthesis of additional methionine. Manipulation of the S-methylmethionine cycle may provide a new approach for improving the nutritional value of major grain crops such as rice, as methionine is a limiting essential amino acid for mammalian diets.
18248596	OsTDL1A binds to the LRR domain of rice receptor kinase MSP1, and is required to limit sporocyte numbers.	2008	Plant J	Hybrids lose heterotic yield advantage when multiplied sexually via meiosis. A potential alternative breeding system for hybrids is apospory, where female gametes develop without meiosis. Common among grasses, apospory begins in the nucellus, where aposporous initials (AIs) appear near the sexual megaspore mother cell (MeMC). The cellular origin of AIs is obscure, but one possibility, suggested by the mac1 and msp1 mutants of maize and rice, is that AIs are apomeiotic derivatives of the additional MeMCs that appear when genetic control over sporocyte numbers is relaxed. MULTIPLE SPOROCYTES1 (MSP1) encodes a leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase, which is orthologous to EXS/EMS1 in Arabidopsis. Like mac1 and msp1, exs/ems1 mutants produce extra sporocytes in the anther instead of a tapetum, causing male sterility. This phenotype is copied in mutants of TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1), which encodes a small protein hypothesized to be an extracellular ligand of EXS/EMS1. Here we show that rice contains two TPD1-like genes, OsTDL1A and OsTDL1B. Both are co-expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co-expressed in the ovule. OsTDL1A binds to the leucine-rich-repeat domain of MSP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in onion cells; OsTDL1B lacks this capacity. When driven by the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL1A phenocopies msp1 in the ovule but not in the anther. Thus, RNAi produces multiple MeMCs without causing male sterility. We conclude that OsTDL1A binds MSP1 in order to limit sporocyte numbers. OsTDL1A-RNAi lines may be suitable starting points for achieving synthetic apospory in rice.
18298667	The maize (Zea mays L.) roothairless3 gene encodes a putative GPI-anchored, monocot-specific, COBRA-like protein that significantly affects grain yield.	2008	Plant J	The rth3 (roothairless 3) mutant is specifically affected in root hair elongation. We report here the cloning of the rth3 gene via a PCR-based strategy (amplification of insertion mutagenized sites) and demonstrate that it encodes a COBRA-like protein that displays all the structural features of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Genes of the COBRA family are involved in various types of cell expansion and cell wall biosynthesis. The rth3 gene belongs to a monocot-specific clade of the COBRA gene family comprising two maize and two rice genes. While the rice (Oryza sativa) gene OsBC1L1 appears to be orthologous to rth3 based on sequence similarity (86% identity at the protein level) and maize/rice synteny, the maize (Zea mays L.) rth3-like gene does not appear to be a functional homolog of rth3 based on their distinct expression profiles. Massively parallel signature sequencing analysis detected rth3 expression in all analyzed tissues, but at relatively low levels, with the most abundant expression in primary roots where the root hair phenotype is manifested. In situ hybridization experiments confine rth3 expression to root hair-forming epidermal cells and lateral root primordia. Remarkably, in replicated field trials involving near-isogenic lines, the rth3 mutant conferred significant losses in grain yield.
18049796	Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) putative transcription factor genes are divided into 4 families. In this work, we studied the function of a rice HD-Zip I gene, H OME O BO X4 (Oshox4). Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized. Over-expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi-dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3. The over-expression plants accumulated elevated levels of bioactive GA, while the GA catabolic gene GA2ox3 was upregulated in the transgenic plants. In addition, over-expression of Oshox4 blocked GA-dependent alpha-amylase production. However, down-regulation of Oshox4 in RNAi transgenic plants induced no phenotypic alteration. Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants. One-hybrid assays showed that Oshox4 could interact with YAB1 promoter in yeast. In addition, Oshox4 expression was upregulated by GA. These data together suggest that Oshox4 may be involved in the negative regulation of GA signalling and may play a role to fine tune GA responses in rice.
18034312	Identification and localisation of the rice nicotianamine aminotransferase gene OsNAAT1 expression suggests the site of phytosiderophore synthesis in rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) take up iron using iron-chelating compounds known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). In the biosynthetic pathway of MAs, nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT) catalyses the key step from nicotianamine to the 3''-keto form. In the present study, we identified six rice NAAT genes (OsNAAT1-6) by screening a cDNA library made from Fe-deficient rice roots and by searching databases. Among the NAAT homologues, OsNAAT1 belongs to a subgroup containing barley functional NAAT (HvNAAT-A and HvNAAT-B) as well as a maize homologue cloned by cDNA library screening (ZmNAAT1). Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that OsNAAT1, but not OsNAAT2-6, was strongly up-regulated by Fe deficiency, both in roots and shoots. The OsNAAT1 protein had NAAT enzyme activity in vitro, confirming that the OsNAAT1 gene encodes functional NAAT. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAAT1 was expressed in companion and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem of Fe-sufficient roots. In addition, expression was induced in all cells of Fe-deficient roots, with particularly strong GUS activity evident in the companion and pericycle cells. OsNAAT1 expression was also observed in the companion cells of Fe-sufficient shoots, and was clearly induced in all the cells of Fe-deficient leaves. These expression patterns highly resemble those of OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and OsDMAS1, the genes responsible for MAs biosynthesis for Fe acquisition. These findings strongly suggest that rice synthesizes MAs in whole Fe-deficient roots to acquire Fe from the rhizosphere, and also in phloem cells to maintain metal homeostasis facilitated by MAs-mediated long-distance transport.
18180880	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	T-DNA tagging is a high throughput strategy for identifying and cloning functional genes in plants. In this study, we screened 4416 lab-created T(1) rice T-DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens. Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma. Instead, they formed degenerative velum-like or filamentous organs accompanying with the lack of lodicules, stamens and pistils at different degree. A 361 bp of genomic sequence flanking the T-DNA isolated using TAIL-PCR (Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) co-segregated with the mutation phenotype. Results of blastn and gene prediction revealed the T-DNA inserted into the promoter region of a function-predicted gene at 283 bp upstream of its transcription start site (TSS). The predicted gene encoded a LOB (Lateral Organ Boundaries) domain-like protein. RT-PCR analyses indicated the transcription level of target candidate gene, DH1, decreased significantly in dh1 mutant. RNAi aimed at DH1 in wild type plants could partially result in the mutation phenotype of dh1. DH1 could also rescue the mutation phenotype in the complement experiment. The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs. The dh1 presented severer mutation phenotype under relatively longer daylight than under shorter daylight implied that shorter daylight induced the expression of gene(s) redundant to DH1 in function and partially compensated for the loss-of-function. It is the first time to report the LOB-domain gene participating in the development of floral organs in rice.
18231866	Rice exonuclease-1 homologue, OsEXO1, that interacts with DNA polymerase lambda and RPA subunit proteins, is involved in cell proliferation.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Exonuclease 1, a class III member of the RAD2 nuclease family, is a structure-specific nuclease involved in DNA metabolism (replication, repair and recombination). We have identified a homologue to Exonuclease-1 from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and have designated it O. sativa Exonuclease-1 (OsEXO1). The open reading frame of OsEXO1 encodes a predicted product of 836 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 92 kDa. Two highly conserved nuclease domains (XPG-N and XPG-I) are present in the N-terminal region of the protein. OsEXO1-sGFP fusion protein transiently overexpressed in the onion epidermal cells localized to the nucleus. The transcript of OsEXO1 is highly expressed in meristematic tissues and panicles. Inhibition of cell proliferation by removal of sucrose from the medium or by the addition of cell cycle inhibitors decreased OsEXO1 expression. Functional complementation assays using yeast RAD2 member null mutants demonstrates that OsEXO1 is able to substitute for ScEXO1 and ScRAD27 functions. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that OsEXO1 interacted with rice DNA polymerase lambda (OsPol lambda), the 70 kDa subunit b of rice replication protein A (OsRPA70b), and the 32 kDa subunit 1 of rice replication protein A (OsRPA32-1). Irradiation of UV-B induces OsEXO1 expression while hydrogen peroxide treatment represses it. These results suggest that OsEXO1 plays an important role in both cell proliferation and UV-damaged nuclear DNA repair pathway under dark conditions.
18236009	A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, is involved in rice fertility and stress tolerance.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in the adaptive stress response and regulates expression of many stress-responsive genes, including some transcriptional factors. A bZIP transcription factor, OsABI5, was isolated from the panicle of Oryza sativa L. Expression of the OsABI5 gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and high salinity, and down-regulated by drought and cold (4 degrees C) in seedlings. The OsABI5 protein was localized in the nucleus and has trans-activation activity. The N-terminal of the protein is necessary for its activity. OsABI5 could bind to a G-box element and trans-activate reporter gene expression. Complementation analysis revealed that the expression of OsABI5 driven by the 35S promoter could rescue ABA-insensitivity of abi5-1 during seed germination and result in hypersensitivity to ABA. Over-expression of OsABI5 in rice conferred high sensitivity to salt stress. Repression of OsABI5 promoted stress tolerance and resulted in low fertility of rice. These results suggested that OsABI5 could regulate the adaptive stress response and plant fertility of rice as a transcription factor.
18273684	Characterization of transcription factor gene SNAC2 conferring cold and salt tolerance in rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Plants respond to adverse environment by initiating a series of signaling processes including activation of transcription factors that can regulate expression of arrays of genes for stress response and adaptation. NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) is a plant specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation. In this report, a stress-responsive NAC gene (SNAC2) isolated from upland rice IRA109 (Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica) was characterized for its role in stress tolerance. SNAC2 was proven to have transactivation and DNA-binding activities in yeast and the SNAC2-GFP fusion protein was localized in the rice nuclei. Northern blot and SNAC2 promoter activity analyses suggest that SNAC2 gene was induced by drought, salinity, cold, wounding, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The SNAC2 gene was over-expressed in japonica rice Zhonghua 11 to test the effect on improving stress tolerance. More than 50% of the transgenic plants remained vigorous when all WT plants died after severe cold stress (4-8 degrees C for 5 days). The transgenic plants had higher cell membrane stability than wild type during the cold stress. The transgenic rice had significantly higher germination and growth rate than WT under high salinity conditions. Over-expression of SNAC2 can also improve the tolerance to PEG treatment. In addition, the SNAC2-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased sensitivity to ABA. DNA chip profiling analysis of transgenic plants revealed many up-regulated genes related to stress response and adaptation such as peroxidase, ornithine aminotransferase, heavy metal-associated protein, sodium/hydrogen exchanger, heat shock protein, GDSL-like lipase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Interestingly, none of the up-regulated genes in the SNAC2-overexpressing plants matched the genes up-regulated in the transgenic plants over-expressing other stress responsive NAC genes reported previously. These data suggest SNAC2 is a novel stress responsive NAC transcription factor that possesses potential utility in improving stress tolerance of rice.
18354041	Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26.	2008	Plant Physiol	Plant MADS-box genes can be divided into 11 groups. Genetic analysis has revealed that most of them function in flowering-time control, reproductive organ development, and vegetative growth. Here, we elucidated the role of OsMADS26, a member of the AGL12 group. Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots. Transgenic plants of both rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) overexpressing this gene manifested phenotypes related to stress responses, such as chlorosis, cell death, pigment accumulation, and defective root/shoot growth. In addition, apical hook development was significantly suppressed in Arabidopsis. Plants transformed with the OsMADS26-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion construct displayed those stress-related phenotypes when treated with dexamethasone. Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsMADS26 induces multiple responses that are related to various stresses.
18274724	Detection of QTLs with additive effects and additive-by-environment interaction effects on panicle number in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with single-segment substitution lines.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	A novel population consisting of 35 single-segment substitution lines (SSSLs) originating from crosses between the recipient parent, Hua-jing-xian 74 (HJX74), and 17 donor parents was evaluated in six cropping season environments to reveal the genetic basis of genetic main effect (G) and genotype-by-environment interaction effect (GE) for panicle number (PN) in rice. Subsets of lines were grown in up to six environments. An indirect analysis method was applied, in which the total genetic effect was first partitioned into G and GE by using the mixed linear-model approach, and then QTL (quantitative trait locus) analyses on these effects were conducted separately. At least 18 QTLs for PN in rice were detected and identified on 9 of 12 rice chromosomes. A single QTL effect (a + ae) ranging from -1.5 to 1.2 was divided into two components, additive effect (a) and additive x environment interaction effect (ae). A total number of 9 and 16 QTLs were identified with a ranging from -0.4 to 0.6 and ae ranging from -1.0 to 0.6, respectively, the former being stable but the latter unstable across environments. Three types of QTLs were suggested according to their effects expressed. Two QTLs (Pn-1b and Pn-6d) expressed stably across environments due to the association with only a, nine QTLs (Pn-1a, Pn-3c, Pn-3d, Pn-4, Pn-6a, Pn-6b, Pn-8, Pn-9 and Pn-12) with only ae were unstable, and the remaining seven of QTLs were identified with both a and ae, which also were unstable across environments. This is the first report on the detection of QE (QTL-by-environment interaction effect) of QTLs with SSSLs. Our results illustrate the efficiency of characterizing QTLs and analyzing action of QTLs through SSSLs, and further demonstrate that QE is an important property of many QTLs. Information provided in this paper could be used in the application of marker-assisted selection to manipulate PN in rice.
18335199	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of hwh1 and hwh2, a set of complementary genes controlling hybrid breakdown in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Hybrid breakdown (HB), a phenomenon of reduced viability or fertility accompanied with retarded growth in hybrid progenies, often arises in the offspring of intersubspecific hybrids between indica and japonica in rice. We detected HB plants in F8 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between an indica variety, Milyang 23, and a japonica variety, Tong 88-7. HB plants showed retarded growth, with fewer tillers and spikelets. Genetic analysis revealed that HB was controlled by the complementary action of two recessive genes, hwh1 and hwh2, originating from each of both parents, which were fine-mapped on the short arm of chromosome 2 and on the near centromere region of the long arm of chromosome 11, respectively. A comparison of the sequences of candidate genes among both parents and HB plants revealed that hwh1 encoded a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase with one amino acid change compared to Hwh1 and that hwh2 probably encoded a putative hexose transporter with a six amino acid insertion compared to Hwh2. Investigation of the distribution of these alleles among 54 japonica and indica cultivars using candidate gene-based markers suggested that the two loci might be involved in developing reproductive barriers between two subspecies.
16254725	Morphogenesis and molecular basis on naked seed rice, a novel homeotic mutation of OsMADS1 regulating transcript level of AP3 homologue in rice.	2006	Planta	The floral organs are formed from floral meristem with a regular initiation pattern in angiosperm species. Flowers of naked seed rice (nsr) were characterized by the overdeveloped lemma and palea, the transformation of lodicules to palea-/lemma-like organs, the decreased number of stamens and occasionally extra pistils. Some nsr spikelets contained additional floral organs of four whorls and/or abnormal internal florets. The floral primordium of nsr spikelet is differentiated under an irregular pattern and an incomplete determination. And molecular analysis indicated that nsr was a novel homeotic mutation in OsMADS1, suggesting that OsMADS1 played a distinct role in regulating the differentiation pattern of floral primordium and in conferring the determination of flower meristem. The gain-of-function of OsMADS1 transgenic lines presented the transformation of outer glumes to lemma-/palea-like organs and no changes in length of lemma and palea, but loss-of-function of OsMADS1 transgenic lines displayed the overdeveloped lemma and palea. Both findings revealed that OsMADS1 played a role in specifying lemma and palea and acted as a repressor of overdevelopment of lemma and palea. Moreover, it was indicated that OsMADS1 upregulated the transcript level of AP3 homologue OsMADS16, using real-time PCR analysis on gain- and loss-of-function of OsMADS1 transgenic lines.
18313797	Overexpression of OsERF1, a novel rice ERF gene, up-regulates ethylene-responsive genes expression besides affects growth and development in Arabidopsis.	2008	J Plant Physiol	Ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs), composing the largest group of AP2/EREBP transcription factors, are involved in diverse functions and some of them have been identified in plants. However, even in model plants Arabidopsis and rice, most of the genes in this group are functionally unknown yet. Especially in rice, ERF genes involved in ethylene response have not been reported previously. Here, we report a novel member of ERF group in rice, OsERF1 (Ethylene Response Factor gene in Oryza sativa). OsERF1 expressed consistently in different organs of rice and could be up-regulated by ethylene, a plant hormone associated with stress response. Overexpression of OsERF1 in Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of two known ethylene-responsive genes, PDF1.2 and b-chitinase, and also significantly affected the growth and development of transgenic Arabidopsis. These results suggest the involvement of OsERF1 in ethylene response.
18820696	Genetic control of rice plant architecture under domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	The closely related wild rice species Oryza rufipogon is considered the progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). The transition from the characteristic plant architecture of wild rice to that of cultivated rice was one of the most important events in rice domestication; however, the molecular basis of this key domestication transition has not been elucidated. Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild-rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers. The gene encodes a newly identified zinc-finger nuclear transcription factor with transcriptional activity and is mapped on chromosome 7. PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation. Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice.
18726583	Isolation and characterization of a low phytic acid rice mutant reveals a mutation in the rice orthologue of maize MIK.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	Using a forward genetics approach, we isolated two independent low phytic acid (lpa) rice mutants, N15-186 and N15-375. Both mutants are caused by single gene, recessive non-lethal mutations, which result in approximately 75% (N15-186) and 43% (N15-375) reductions in seed phytic acid (inositol hexakisphosphate). High-performance liquid chromatography and GC-MS analysis of seed extracts from N15-186 indicated that, in addition to phytic acid, inositol monophosphate was significantly reduced whereas inorganic phosphorus and myo-inositol were greatly increased when compared with wild-type. The changes observed in N15-186 resemble those previously described for the maize lpa3 mutant. Analysis of N15-375 revealed changes similar to those observed in previously characterized rice lpa1 mutants (i.e. significant reduction in phytic acid and corresponding increase in inorganic phosphorus with little or no change in inositol phosphate intermediates or myo-inositol). Further genetic analysis of the N15-186 mutant indicated that the mutation, designated lpa N15-186, was located in a region on chromosome 3 between the microsatellite markers RM15875 and RM15907. The rice orthologue of maize lpa3, which encodes a myo-inositol kinase, is in this interval. Sequence analysis of the N15-186 allele of this orthologue (Os03g52760) revealed a single base pair change (C/G to T/A) in the first exon of the gene, which results in a nonsense mutation. Our results indicate that lpa N15-186 is a mutant allele of the rice myo-inositol kinase (OsMIK) gene. Identification and characterization of lpa mutants, such as N15-186, will facilitate studies on the regulation of phytic acid biosynthesis and accumulation and help address questions concerning the contribution of the inositol lipid-dependent and independent biosynthetic pathways to the production of seed phytic acid.
18726584	Novel QTLs for photoperiodic flowering revealed by using reciprocal backcross inbred lines from crosses between japonica rice cultivars.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The rice japonica cultivars Nipponbare and Koshihikari differ in heading date and response of heading to photoperiod (photoperiod sensitivity). Using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses for heading date in a set of reciprocal backcross inbred lines (BILs) from crosses between Nipponbare and Koshihikari. Under natural-day conditions, transgressive segregation in days to heading (DTH) toward both early and late heading was observed in both BIL populations. QTL analyses revealed that two QTLs--on chromosomes 3 and 6--were involved in the difference in heading date between the parental cultivars. The Nipponbare allele at the QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 6 showed, respectively, increasing and decreasing effects on DTH in both BIL populations. The transgressive segregation observed in the BILs could be accounted for mainly by the complementary action of a set of alleles with opposing effects. Both QTLs were finely mapped as single Mendelian factors in secondary mapping populations (BC2F2 plants/BC2F3 lines). The QTL on chromosome 3 was mapped in the 1,140-kb interval between 94O03-4 (SSR) and OJ21G19-4 (SNP) and was designated Hd16. The QTL on chromosome 6 was mapped in the 328-kb interval between P548D347 (SSR) and 0007O20 (SSR) and was designated Hd17. Both Hd16 and Hd17 were involved in photoperiod sensitivity, as revealed by observation of the DTH of nearly isogenic lines of Nipponbare under short- and long-day conditions, suggesting that allelic differences in both Hd16 and Hd17 account for most of the difference in photoperiod sensitivity between the parental cultivars.
17112320	Genomic variation in rice: genesis of highly polymorphic linkage blocks during domestication.	2006	PLoS Genet	Genomic regions that are unusually divergent between closely related species or racial groups can be particularly informative about the process of speciation or the operation of natural selection. The two sequenced genomes of cultivated Asian rice, Oryza sativa, reveal that at least 6% of the genomes are unusually divergent. Sequencing of ten unlinked loci from the highly divergent regions consistently identified two highly divergent haplotypes with each locus in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium among 25 O. sativa cultivars and 35 lines from six wild species. The existence of two highly divergent haplotypes in high divergence regions in species from all geographical areas (Africa, Asia, and Oceania) was in contrast to the low polymorphism and low linkage disequilibrium that were observed in other parts of the genome, represented by ten reference loci. While several natural processes are likely to contribute to this pattern of genomic variation, domestication may have greatly exaggerated the trend. In this hypothesis, divergent haplotypes that were adapted to different geographical and ecological environments migrated along with humans during the development of domesticated varieties. If true, these high divergence regions of the genome would be enriched for loci that contribute to the enormous range of phenotypic variation observed among domesticated breeds.
18820698	Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	Grain-filling, an important trait that contributes greatly to grain weight, is regulated by quantitative trait loci and is associated with crop domestication syndrome. However, the genes and underlying molecular mechanisms controlling crop grain-filling remain elusive. Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of the rice GIF1 (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1) gene that encodes a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling. The cultivated GIF1 gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain-filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene's regulatory sequence through domestication. Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice GIF1 is responsible for grain weight reduction. Ectopic expression of the cultivated GIF1 gene with the 35S or rice Waxy promoter resulted in smaller grains, whereas overexpression of GIF1 driven by its native promoter increased grain production. These findings, together with the domestication signature that we identified by comparing nucleotide diversity of the GIF1 loci between cultivated and wild rice, strongly suggest that GIF1 is a potential domestication gene and that such a domestication-selected gene can be used for further crop improvement.
18281124	Alternative splicing of the rice OsMET1 genes encoding maintenance DNA methyltransferase.	2008	J Plant Physiol	While the Arabidopsis genome carries one copy of the methyltransferase 1 (MET1) gene for DNA methyltransferase, which is mainly responsible for maintaining CpG methylation, the rice genome bears two copies of the MET1 genes, OsMET1a and OsMET1b. The transcripts of OsMET1b accumulate more abundantly than those of OsMET1a in all of the tissues examined, and both genes actively transcribed at the callus, imbibed embryo, root, meristem, young panicle, anther, pistil, and endosperm, all of which contain actively dividing cells. The OsMET1a transcripts contain two 5'-untranslated exons and alternatively spliced 3'-terminal exons. The alternatively spliced transcripts consist of 14, 15, or 16 exons, and all of them encode a putative protein of 1527 amino acids. While the 3'-terminal exon of OsMET1b is unique, alternative splicing occurs in the 5'-terminal regions, which comprise either exons containing 5'-untranslated regions or an exon bearing the initiation codon. Depending upon alternative usage of 5' exons by alternative splicing, the OsMET1b transcripts comprise 11, 12, 13, or 14 exons, and the former two and the latter two longer transcripts encode putative proteins of 1486 and 1529 amino acids, respectively. Moreover, the 5' splicing patterns of OsMET1b can vary in different tissues. These findings are discussed with respect to the possible regulation of the OsMET1 genes.
18594992	ROLLED LEAF 9, encoding a GARP protein, regulates the leaf abaxial cell fate in rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Leaves, the collective organ produced by the shoot apical meristem (SAM), are polarized along their adaxial-abaxial axis. In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (rl9-1) and rl9-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets. We cloned the RL9 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy. Molecular studies have revealed that RL9 encodes a GARP protein, an orthologue of Arabidopsis KANADIs. RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers. The transient expression of a RL9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor.
18712516	Contrasting population genetic structure and gene flow between Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	The cross compatible wild relatives of crops have furnished valuable genes for crop improvement. Understanding the genetics of these wild species may enhance their further use in breeding. In this study, sequence variation of the nuclear Lhs1 gene was used to investigate the population genetic structure and gene flow of Oryza rufipogon and O. nivara, two wild species most closely related to O. sativa. The two species diverge markedly in life history and mating system, with O. rufipogon being perennial and outcrossing and O. nivara being annual and predominantly inbreeding. Based on sequence data from 105 plants representing 11 wild populations covering the entire geographic range of these wild species, we detected significantly higher nucleotide variation in O. rufipogon than in O. nivara at both the population and species levels. At the population level the diversity in O. rufipogon (Hd = 0.712; theta (sil) = 0.0017) is 2-3 folds higher than that in O. nivara (Hd = 0.306; theta (sil) = 0.0005). AMOVA partitioning indicated that genetic differentiation among O. nivara populations (78.2%) was much higher than that among O. rufipogon populations (52.3%). The different level of genetic diversity and contrasting population genetic structure between O. rufipogon and O. nivara might be explained by their distinct life histories and mating systems. Our simulation using IM models demonstrated significant gene flow from O. nivara to O. rufipogon, indicating a directional introgression from the annual and selfing species into the perennial and outcrossing species. The ongoing introgression has played an important role in shaping current patterns of genetic diversity of these two wild species.
19098269	Dynamic evolution of oryza genomes is revealed by comparative genomic analysis of a genus-wide vertical data set.	2008	Plant Cell	Oryza (23 species; 10 genome types) contains the world's most important food crop - rice. Although the rice genome serves as an essential tool for biological research, little is known about the evolution of the other Oryza genome types. They contain a historical record of genomic changes that led to diversification of this genus around the world as well as an untapped reservoir of agriculturally important traits. To investigate the evolution of the collective Oryza genome, we sequenced and compared nine orthologous genomic regions encompassing the Adh1-Adh2 genes (from six diploid genome types) with the rice reference sequence. Our analysis revealed the architectural complexities and dynamic evolution of this region that have occurred over the past approximately 15 million years. Of the 46 intact genes and four pseudogenes in the japonica genome, 38 (76%) fell into eight multigene families. Analysis of the evolutionary history of each family revealed independent and lineage-specific gain and loss of gene family members as frequent causes of synteny disruption. Transposable elements were shown to mediate massive replacement of intergenic space (>95%), gene disruption, and gene/gene fragment movement. Three cases of long-range structural variation (inversions/deletions) spanning several hundred kilobases were identified that contributed significantly to genome diversification.
18573188	Overexpression of a rice defense-related F-box protein gene OsDRF1 in tobacco improves disease resistance through potentiation of defense gene expression.	2008	Physiol Plant	F-box proteins play important roles in plant growth/development and responses to environmental stimuli through targeting substrates into degradation machinery. A rice defense-related F-box protein gene, OsDRF1, was cloned and identified during a course of study aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of induced immunity in rice. OsDRF1 encodes a protein of 328 amino acids, containing a highly conserved F-box domain. Expression of OsDRF1 was induced upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical inducer of defense responses in rice. Moreover, in BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsDRF1 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsDRF1 was also upregulated in rice seedlings after treatment with ABA. Overexpression of OsDRF1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced disease resistance against tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci and strengthened expression of defense-related genes after salicylic acid treatment or ToMV infection. Root elongation of the OsDRF1-overexpressing transgenic seedlings was significantly inhibited by ABA, indicating that overexpression of OsDRF1 resulted in increased ABA sensitivity. The results suggest that OsDRF1 plays a role in disease resistance via upregulating defense-related gene expression and that OsDRF1 may also be involved in the response to ABA.
19027836	Screening and cloning of antimicrobial DNA sequences using a vital staining method.	2009	Gene	A novel method for cloning of genes coding for cytotoxic molecules based on a cell viability assay is described. The working hypothesis is that expression of DNA sequences coding for cytotoxic molecules in bacterial cells will lead to cell death or impairment, and the isolation of the impaired or dead cells could lead to identification of DNA sequences responsible for debilitating the host cells. We verified this concept by isolating the well known antimicrobial Puroindoline b gene in Escherichia coli cells. We further demonstrated the feasibility to use this approach for isolating DNA encoding for antimicrobials from cDNA expression libraries. Sequence analysis and bioassay indicated that the isolated clones encoded previously characterized antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), proteins not previously characterized as AMPs, as well as novel antimicrobial peptides. In addition, clones harboring ribosomal protein encoding cDNA were also identified. Therefore, this method could also be used to identify host genes important in maintaining bacterial cell viability.
18824474	Evolutionary analysis of the Sub1 gene cluster that confers submergence tolerance to domesticated rice.	2009	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tolerance of complete submergence is recognized in a small number of accessions of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and can be conferred by the Sub1A-1 gene of the polygenic Submergence-1 (Sub1) locus. In all O. sativa varieties, the Sub1 locus encodes the ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) genes Sub1B and Sub1C. A third paralogous ERF gene, Sub1A, is limited to a subset of indica accessions. It is thought that O. sativa was domesticated from the gene pools of the wild perennial species O. rufipogon Griff. and/or the annual species O. nivara Sharma et Shastry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the orthologues of the Sub1 locus in the closest relatives of O. sativa to provide insight into the origin of the gene and allelic variation of the Sub1 locus.

METHODS: Orthologues of the Sub1 genes were isolated from O. rufipogon and O. nivara by use of oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the most highly conserved regions of the Sub1 genes of domesticated rice. The phylogenetic relatedness of Sub1 genes of O. sativa and its wild relatives was evaluated.

KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both O. rufipogon and O. nivara possess two Sub1 gene orthologues with strong sequence identity to the Sub1B and Sub1C alleles of cultivated rice. The phylogeny of the Sub1 genes of the domesticated and wild rice suggests that Sub1A arose from duplication of Sub1B. Variation in Sub1B alleles is correlated with the absence or presence of Sub1A. Together, the results indicate that genetic variation at the Sub1 locus is due to gene duplication and divergence that have occurred both prior to and after rice domestication.
18808453	Refunctionalization of the ancient rice blast disease resistance gene Pit by the recruitment of a retrotransposon as a promoter.	2009	Plant J	The plant genome contains a large number of disease resistance (R) genes that have evolved through diverse mechanisms. Here, we report that a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon contributed to the evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pit. Pit confers race-specific resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and is a member of the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family of R genes. Compared with the non-functional allele Pit(Npb), the functional allele Pit(K59) contains four amino acid substitutions, and has the LTR retrotransposon Renovator inserted upstream. Pathogenesis assays using chimeric constructs carrying the various regions of Pit(K59) and Pit(Npb) suggest that amino acid substitutions might have a potential effect in Pit resistance; more importantly, the upregulated promoter activity conferred by the Renovator sequence is essential for Pit function. Our data suggest that transposon-mediated transcriptional activation may play an important role in the refunctionalization of additional 'sleeping' R genes in the plant genome.
19168991	DNA polymorphism in the SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1) locus of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon and its related species.	2008	Genes Genet Syst	The level and pattern of nucleotide variation in the SUPERWOMAN1(SPW1) locus of the wild rice Oriza rufipogon and its related species were analyzed. SPW1 is orthologous to APETELA3(AP3) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The estimated level of nucleotide variation for the entire region (pi = 0.0046) was intermediate among those for other genes of O. rufipogon, although the estimates varied considerably among the SPW1 domains. Complicated haplotype structure was detected, resulting in a high proportion of significant linkage disequilibrium. Deviation from the neutrality was not detected. However, purifying selection was suggested by lack of replacement variation in the MADS-box and I-domain regions, which function as DNA-binding domain. On the other hand, an excess of drastic amino acid changes was detected in the C-domain, as in the AP3 region of A. thaliana. Taken together, these results imply that different types of natural selection are acting among different domains of a single protein. In the phylogenetic tree, O. sativa strains were included in the same cluster of O. rufipogon, supporting the hypothesis that O. rufipogon is the wild ancestor of O. sativa.
19825617	Conserved functions of Arabidopsis and rice CC-type glutaredoxins in flower development and pathogen response.	2009	Mol Plant	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are ubiquitous oxidoreductases that play a crucial role in response to oxidative stress by reducing disulfides in various organisms. In planta, three different GRX classes have been identified according to their active site motifs. CPYC and CGFS classes are found in all organisms, whereas the CC-type class is specific for higher land plants. Recently, two Arabidopsis CC-type GRXs, ROXY1 and ROXY2, were shown to exert crucial functions in petal and anther initiation and differentiation. To analyze the function of CC-type GRXs in the distantly related monocots, we isolated and characterized OsROXY1 and OsROXY2-two rice homologs of ROXY1. Both genes are expressed in vegetative and reproductive stages. Although rice flower morphology is distinct from eudicots, OsROXY1/2 floral expression patterns are similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts ROXY1/2. Complementation experiments demonstrate that OsROXY1 and OsROXY2 can fully rescue the roxy1 floral mutant phenotype. Overexpression of OsROXY1, OsROXY2, and ROXY1 in Arabidopsis causes similar vegetative and reproductive plant developmental defects. ROXY1 and its rice homologs thus exert a conserved function during eudicot and monocot flower development. Strikingly, overexpression of these CC-type GRXs also leads to an increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide levels and hyper-susceptibility to infection from the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea, revealing the importance of balanced redox processes in flower organ development and pathogen defence.
19074278	CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The initiation of intracellular infection of legume roots by symbiotic rhizobia bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi is preceded by the induction of calcium signatures in and around the nucleus of root epidermal cells. Although a calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase (CCaMK) is a key mediator of symbiotic root responses, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood. Here, we characterize Lotus japonicus cyclops mutants on which microbial infection was severely inhibited. In contrast, nodule organogenesis was initiated in response to rhizobia, but arrested prematurely. This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules. Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK. We identified CYCLOPS by positional cloning. CYCLOPS carries a functional nuclear localization signal and a predicted coiled-coil domain. We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation. Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro. Cyclops mutants of rice were impaired in AM, and rice CYCLOPS could restore symbiosis in Lotus cyclops mutants, indicating a functional conservation across angiosperms. Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates.
18980655	Disruption of a novel gene for a NAC-domain protein in rice confers resistance to Rice dwarf virus.	2009	Plant J	Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is a serious viral pest that is transmitted to rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) by leafhoppers and causes a dwarfism in infected plants. To identify host factors involved in the multiplication of RDV, we screened Tos17 insertion mutant lines of rice for mutants with reduced susceptibility to RDV. One mutant, designated rim1-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV. The accumulation of RDV capsid proteins was also drastically reduced in inoculated rim1-1 mutant plants. Co-segregation and complementation analyses revealed that the rim1-1 mutation had been caused by insertion of Tos17 in an intron of a novel NAC gene. The rim1-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant. We propose that RIM1 functions as a host factor that is required for multiplication of RDV in rice.
18952859	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Poaceae, one of the largest flowering plant families in angiosperms, evolved distinct inflorescence and flower morphology diverging from eudicots and other monocots. However, the mechanism underlying the specification of flower morphology in grasses remains unclear. Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development. The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea. The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma. Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry. This work therefore extends the function of the TCP gene family members in defining the diversification of floral morphology in grasses and suggests that a common conserved mechanism controlling floral zygomorphy by CYC-like genes exists in both eudicots and the grasses.
19033526	Independent losses of function in a polyphenol oxidase in rice: differentiation in grain discoloration between subspecies and the role of positive selection under domestication.	2008	Plant Cell	Asian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars originated from wild rice and can be divided into two subspecies by several criteria, one of which is the phenol reaction (PHR) phenotype. Grains of indica cultivars turn brown in a phenol solution that accelerates a similar process that occurs during prolonged storage. By contrast, the grains of japonica do not discolor. This distinction may reflect the divergent domestication of these two subspecies. The PHR is controlled by a single gene, Phr1; here, we report the cloning of Phr1, which encodes a polyphenol oxidase. The Phr1 gene is indeed responsible for the PHR phenotype, as transformation with a functional Phr1 can complement a PHR negative cultivar. Phr1 is defective in all japonica lines but functional in nearly all indica and wild strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the defects in Phr1 arose independently three times. The multiple recent origins and rapid spread of phr1 in japonica suggest the action of positive selection, which is further supported by several population genetic tests. This case may hence represent an example of artificial selection driving the differentiation among domesticated varieties.
18939965	BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Plant J	Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are one of the largest enzyme groups required for the synthesis of complex wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins in plants. However, due to the limited number of related mutants that have observable phenotypes, the biological function(s) of most GTs in cell-wall biosynthesis and assembly have remained elusive. We report here the isolation and in-depth characterization of a brittle rice mutant, brittle culm 10 (bc10). bc10 plants show pleiotropic phenotypes, including brittleness of the plant body and retarded growth. The BC10 gene was cloned through a map-based approach, and encodes a Golgi-located type II membrane protein that contains a domain designated as 'domain of unknown function 266' (DUF266) and represents a multiple gene family in rice. BC10 has low sequence similarity with the domain to a core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), and its in vitro enzymatic activity suggests that it functions as a glycosyltransferase. Monosaccharide analysis of total and fractioned wall residues revealed that bc10 showed impaired cellulose biosynthesis. Immunolocalization and isolation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) in the wild-type and bc10 showed that the level of AGPs in the mutant is significantly affected. BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties.
17375279	Fine mapping and allelic dosage effect of Hwc1, a complementary hybrid weakness gene in rice.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Hybrid weakness is a reproductive barrier that is found in many plant species. In rice, the hybrid weakness caused by two complementary genes, Hwc1 and Hwc2, has been surveyed intensively. However, their gene products and the molecular mechanism that causes hybrid weakness have remained unknown. We performed linkage analyses of Hwc1, narrowed down the area of interest to 60 kb, and identified eight candidate genes. In the F(2) population, in which both Hwc1 and Hwc2 genes were segregated, plants were separable into four classes according to their respective phenotypes: severe type, semi-severe type, F(1) type, and normal type. Severe type plants show such severe symptoms that they could produce only tiny shoot-like structures; they were unable to generate roots. Genetic analyses using closely linked DNA markers of the two genes showed that the symptoms of the F(2) plants were explainable by the genotypes of Hwc1 and Hwc2. Weakness was observed in plants that have both Hwc1 and Hwc2. In Hwc1 homozygote, the symptoms worsened and severe type or semi-severe type plants appeared. Consequently, Hwc1 should have a gene dosage effect and be a semi-dominant gene. The dosage effect of Hwc2 was recognizable, but it was not so severe as that in Hwc1. These results are useful to elucidate the mechanism that causes the hybrid weakness phenomenon and the role of each causal gene in hybrid weakness.
18943128	Inheritance of resistance to bacterial blight in 21 cultivars of rice.	2003	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Genetic analysis for resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) of 21 rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars was carried out. These cultivars were divided into two groups based on their reactions to Philippine races of bacterial blight. Cultivars of group 1 were resistant to race 1 and those of group 2 were susceptible to race 1 but resistant to race 2. All the cultivars were crossed with TN1, which is susceptible to all the Philippine races of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. F(1) and F(2) populations of hybrids of group 1 cultivars were evaluated using race 1 and F(1) and F(2) populations of hybrids of group 2 cultivars were evaluated using race 2. All the cultivars showed monogenic inheritance of resistance. Allelic relationships of the genes were investigated by crossing these cultivars with different testers having single genes for resistance. Three cultivars have Xa4, another three have xa5, one has xa8, two have Xa3, eight have Xa10, and one has Xa4 as well as Xa10. Three cultivars have new, as yet undescribed, genes. Nep Bha Bong To has a new recessive gene for moderate resistance to races 1, 2, and 3 and resistance to race 5. This gene is designated xa26(t). Arai Raj has a dominant gene for resistance to race 2 which segregates independently of Xa10. This gene is designated as Xa27(t). Lota Sail has a recessive gene for resistance to race 2 which segregates independently of Xa10. This gene is designated as xa28(t).
15473325	[Mapping of a new resistance gene to bacterial blight in rice line introgressed from Oryza officinalis].	2004	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Rice line 'B5', which was derived from the wild rice Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt through introgression, has been proved to be high resistant to brown planthopper, whitebacked planthopper and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). In this study, the resistance to bacterial blight of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between ' B5' and 'Minghui63' were evaluated and RFLP markers linked to the resistance gene were identified by bulked segregant analysis. Analysis of the molecular marker linkage map and the data of the lesion length of RILs located the resistant gene within a 1. 3 cM region flanked by RFLP markers C904 and R596 on chromosome 1. This locus contributed to 52.96% of the phenotypic variance of resistance in the population, and is considered to be a new locus as compared with other resistant genes to bacterial blight that have been reported. We tentatively designate this gene as Xa29(t). This newly tagged gene introgressed from wild rice is valuable to molecular marker-assisted selection for multiple resistant materials in rice breeding programme. Furthermore, it provides information for cloning the resistant gene Xa29(t) in rice.
16936841	Distribution, structure, organ-specific expression, and phylogenic analysis of the pathogenesis-related protein-3 chitinase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Genome	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) pathogenesis-related (PR)-3 chitinases, like other PR proteins, are each coded by one of the genes of a multigene family in the plant genome. We assembled the database information about rice PR-3 chitinase sequences. A total of 12 PR-3 chitinase loci (Cht1 to Cht12) were found deployed in the rice genome. Some of the loci were occupied by 2 or more alleles. For all the loci expect Cht4, Cht5, Cht6, and Cht11, the amino acid sequence was polymorphic between japonica and indica varieties of rice, but glutamic acid acting as a catalytic residue was completely conserved in all the loci expect Cht7. All the genes except Cht7, which was not tested in this study, were transcripted in some organs (leaf, sheath, root, and meristem) of rice plants. These results suggest that chitinase proteins encoded by the genes at these loci have important biological effects, at least antifungal activities, on rice plants. We also proposed a new classification of rice PR-3 chitinases based on their domain structures. This classification was consistent with the results of phylogenetic analysis of rice chitinases.
17273822	Isolation and molecular characterization of a Spotted leaf 18 mutant by modified activation-tagging in rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	A lesion mimic mutant that we designated Spotted leaf 18 (Spl18) was isolated from 13,000 activation-tagging lines of rice produced by our modified activation-tagging vector and further characterized. Spl18 was dominant and its phenotype was linked to the T-DNA insertion. An ORF was located about 500 bp downstream of the inserted T-DNA, and the deduced protein, designated OsAT1, showed sequence similarity to an acyltransferase whose expression is induced by hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade. In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath. In addition, transcription of the genes for PR protein was upregulated in Spl18, accumulation of phytoalexins (both momilactone A and sakuranetin) was increased, and resistance to blast disease was improved. We then combined OsAT1 genomic DNA downstream of the modified 35S promoter and re-transformed it into rice. Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes. In addition, plants overexpressing OsAT1 showed resistance to bacterial blight.
17507777	Transposon display for active DNA transposons in rice.	2007	Genes Genet Syst	Transposon display (TD) is a powerful technique to identify the integration site of transposons in gene tagging as a functional genomic tool for elucidating gene function. Although active endogenous DNA transposons have been used extensively for gene tagging in maize, only two active endogenous DNA transposons in rice have been identified, the 0.43-kb element mPing of the MITE family and the 0.6-kb nDart element of the hAT family. The nDart transposition was shown to be induced by crossing with a line containing its autonomous element aDart and stabilized by segregating aDart under natural growth conditions, while mPing-related elements were shown to transpose in cultured cells, plants regenerated from an anther culture, and gamma-ray-irradiated plants. No somaclonal variation should occur in nDart-promoted gene tagging because no tissue culture was involved in nDart activation. As an initial step to develop an effective tagging system using nDart in rice, we tried to visualize GC-rich nDart-related elements comprising 18 nDart-related sequences of 0.6-kb and 63 nDart-related elements longer than 2 kb in Nipponbare by TD. Comparing the observed bands in TD with the anticipated virtual bands of the nDart-related elements based upon the available rice genome sequence, we have improved our TD protocol by optimizing the PCR amplification conditions and are able to visualize approximately 87% of the anticipated bands produced from the nDart-related elements. To compare the visualization efficiency of these nDart-related elements with that of 50 mPing elements and a unique Ping sequence in Nipponbare, we also tried to visualize the mPing-related elements; all mPing-related elements are easily visualized. Based on these results, we discuss the parameters affecting the visualization efficiencies of these rice DNA transposons. We also discuss the utilization of nDart elements in gene tagging for functional genomics in rice.
17619151	Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Increasing its root to shoot ratio is a plant strategy for restoring water homeostasis in response to the long-term imposition of mild water stress. In addition to its important role in diverse fundamental processes, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is involved in root growth and development. Recent extensive characterizations of the YUCCA gene family in Arabidopsis and rice have elucidated that member's function in a tryptophan-dependent IAA biosynthetic pathway. Through forward- and reverse-genetics screening, we have isolated Tos17 and T-DNA insertional rice mutants in a CONSTITUTIVELY WILTED1 (COW1) gene, which encodes a new member of the YUCCA protein family. Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios. These phenotypes are evident in seedlings as early as 7-10 d after germination, and remain until maturity. When oscow1 seedlings are grown under low-intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled-leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated. For comparison, in such conditions, the transpiration rate for WT leaves decreases approx. 5- to 10-fold, implying that this mutant trait results from wilting rather than being a morphogenic defect. Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio. Thus, our observations suggest that OsCOW1-mediated IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in maintaining root to shoot ratios and, in turn, affects water homeostasis in rice.
17721709	The genetic basic and fine-mapping of a stable quantitative-trait loci for aluminium tolerance in rice.	2007	Planta	Aluminium (Al) toxicity is a primary cause of low rice productivity in acid soils. We have mapped a number of quantitative-trait loci (QTL) controlling Al tolerance in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the tolerant japonica cultivar Asominori and the sensitive indica cultivar IR24. Tolerance was assessed on the basis of relative root elongation. QTL were detected on chromosomes 1, 9, and 11, with the percentages of phenotypic variance explained ranging from 13.5 to 17.7%. Alleles from Asominori at all three QTL were associated with increased Al tolerance. qRRE-9 is expressed both in the genetic background of IR24 and in an Asominori/IR24-mixed background. qRRE-9 was reduced to the single recessive Mendelian factor Alt-9. High-resolution genetic and physical maps were constructed for Alt-9 in a BC(3)F(2) population of 1,043 individuals. Alt-9 maps between RM24702 and ID47-2 on chromosome 9, and co-segregates with RM5765.
18357468	Rice lesion mimic mutants with enhanced resistance to diseases.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Lesion mimic mutants are characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions in the absence of pathogens. Such genetic defects often result in enhanced resistance to pathogen infection and constitutive expression of defense response genes. To understand the genetic mechanisms leading to these mutations, we characterized 21 lesion mimic mutants isolated from IR64 rice mutant populations produced by mutagenesis with diepoxybutane (D), gamma rays (G), and fast neutrons (F). Four mutations are controlled by single dominant genes, one of which is inherited maternally. Five lesion mimics are allelic to known spotted leaf (spl) mutants spl1, spl2, spl3, or spl6. In total, 11 new lesion mimic mutations, named spl16, spl17, and spl19 through Spl27, were established based on allelism tests. Two lesion mimics, spl17 and Spl26 showed enhanced resistance to multiple strains of Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the bacterial blight (BB) pathogen. Co-segregation analyses of blast and BB resistance and lesion mimic phenotypes in segregating populations of spl17 and Spl26 indicate that enhanced resistance to the two diseases is conferred by mutations in the lesion mimic genes. A double mutant produced from two independent lesion mimics showed more severe lesions and higher level of resistance to X. o. pv. oryzae than their single mutant parents indicating a synergistic effect of the two mutations. In mutants that exhibit enhanced disease resistance to both pathogens, increases in expression of defense response genes PR-10a, POX22.3, and PO-C1 were correlated with lesion mimic development and enhancement of resistance. These lesion mimic mutants may provide essential materials for a comprehensive dissection of the disease resistance pathways in rice.
18596034	His-311 and Arg-559 are key residues involved in fatty acid oxygenation in pathogen-inducible oxygenase.	2008	J Biol Chem	Pathogen-inducible oxygenase (PIOX) oxygenates fatty acids into 2R-hydroperoxides. PIOX belongs to the fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase family, which exhibits homology to cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). Although these enzymes share common catalytic features, including the use of a tyrosine radical during catalysis, little is known about other residues involved in the dioxygenase reaction of PIOX. We generated a model of linoleic acid (LA) bound to PIOX based on computational sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions with COX-1 and experimental observations that governed the placement of carbon-2 of LA below the catalytic Tyr-379. Examination of the model identified His-311, Arg-558, and Arg-559 as potential molecular determinants of the dioxygenase reaction. Substitutions at His-311 and Arg-559 resulted in mutant constructs that retained virtually no oxygenase activity, whereas substitutions of Arg-558 caused only moderate decreases in activity. Arg-559 mutant constructs exhibited increases of greater than 140-fold in Km, whereas no substantial change in Km was observed for His-311 or Arg-558 mutant constructs. Thermal shift assays used to measure ligand binding affinity show that the binding of LA is significantly reduced in a Y379F/R559A mutant construct compared with that observed for Y379F/R558A construct. Although Oryza sativa PIOX exhibited oxygenase activity against a variety of 14-20-carbon fatty acids, the enzyme did not oxygenate substrates containing modifications at the carboxylate, carbon-1, or carbon-2. Taken together, these data suggest that Arg-559 is required for high affinity binding of substrates to PIOX, whereas His-311 is involved in optimally aligning carbon-2 below Tyr-379 for catalysis.
18663450	Magnetic resonance imaging of palindromic rheumatism.	2008	Rheumatol Int	A 44-year-old man with intermittent asymmetric migratory oligoarthritis lasting the recent decade was admitted to our hospital. Considerable specific biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis such as anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody are all negative. He was diagnosed as palindromic rheumatism (PR). Although hand X-rays showed no remarkable findings, hand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected pannus and bone erosion. PR is defined as the disease characterized by short-lasting attacks of acute oligoarthritis, without radiographic changes. To our knowledge, the findings of MRI for PR have not been previously described. We propose that MRI findings in patients with PR is useful tool to distinguish PR from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other RA related diseases.
15905328	Comparative transcriptomics of rice reveals an ancient pattern of response to microbial colonization.	2005	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Glomalean fungi induce and colonize symbiotic tissue called arbuscular mycorrhiza on the roots of most land plants. Other fungi also colonize plants but cause disease not symbiosis. Whole-transcriptome analysis using a custom-designed Affymetrix Gene-Chip and confirmation with real-time RT-PCR revealed 224 genes affected during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. We compared these transcription profiles with those from rice roots that were colonized by pathogens (Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium moniliforme). Over 40% of genes showed differential regulation caused by both the symbiotic and at least one of the pathogenic interactions. A set of genes was similarly expressed in all three associations, revealing a conserved response to fungal colonization. The responses that were shared between pathogen and symbiont infection may play a role in compatibility. Likewise, the responses that are different may cause disease. Some of the genes that respond to mycorrhizal colonization may be involved in the uptake of phosphate. Indeed, phosphate addition mimicked the effect of mycorrhiza on 8% of the tested genes. We found that 34% of the mycorrhiza-associated rice genes were also associated with mycorrhiza in dicots, revealing a conserved pattern of response between the two angiosperm classes.
17129318	The gene for fragrance in rice.	2005	Plant Biotechnol J	The flavour or fragrance of basmati and jasmine rice is associated with the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. A recessive gene (fgr) on chromosome 8 of rice has been linked to this important trait. Here, we show that a gene with homology to the gene that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD) has significant polymorphisms in the coding region of fragrant genotypes relative to non-fragrant genotypes. The accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in fragrant rice genotypes may be explained by the presence of mutations resulting in a loss of function of the fgr gene product. The allele in fragrant genotypes has a mutation introducing a stop codon upstream of key amino acid sequences conserved in other BADs. The fgr gene corresponds to the gene encoding BAD2 in rice, while BAD1 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 4. BAD has been linked to stress tolerance in plants. However, the apparent loss of function of BAD2 does not seem to limit the growth of fragrant rice genotypes. Fragrance in domesticated rice has apparently originated from a common ancestor and may have evolved in a genetically isolated population, or may be the outcome of a separate domestication event. This is an example of effective human selection for a recessive trait during domestication.
18340459	Involvement of polyamines in the post-anthesis development of inferior and superior spikelets in rice.	2008	Planta	Early-flowered superior spikelets usually exhibit a faster grain filling rate and heavier grain weight than late-flowered inferior spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa L.). But the intrinsic factors responsible for the variations between the two types of spikelets are unclear. This study investigated whether and how polyamines (PAs) are involved in regulating post-anthesis development of rice spikelets. Six rice genotypes differing in grain filling rate were field grown, and PA levels and activities of the enzymes involved in PA biosynthesis were measured in both superior and inferior spikelets. The results showed that superior spikelets exhibited higher levels of free spermidine (Spd) and free spermine (Spm) and higher activities of arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC, EC 4.1.1.50) and Spd synthase (EC 2.5.1.16) than inferior spikelets at the early endosperm cell division and grain filling stage. The maximum concentrations of free Spd and free Spm and the maximum activities of ADC, SAMDC and Spd synthase were significantly correlated with the maximum cell division and grain filling rates, maximum cell number and grain weight. Application of Spd and Spm to panicles resulted in significantly higher rates of endosperm cell division and grain filling in inferior spikelets along with the activities of sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13), ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27) and soluble starch synthase (EC 2.4.1.21), suggesting that these PAs are involved in the sucrose-starch metabolic pathway. The results indicate that the poor development of inferior spikelets is attributed, at least partly, to the low PA level and its low biosynthetic activity.
18509653	Comparative physiological and molecular responses of a common aromatic indica rice cultivar to high salinity with non-aromatic indica rice cultivars.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of salt-stress response in the aromatic rice Gobindobhog, a comprehensive analysis encompassing physiological or biochemical assays and gene expression studies under high salt (200 mM NaCl) supply regimes were initiated and compared with a salt-sensitive (M-1-48) and salt-tolerant (Nonabokra) rice. The detrimental effects of salinity stress were the most pronounced in Gobindobhog, as reflected by the maximally increased root to shoot ratio, the highest chlorophyll degeneration, the highest foliar concentration of Na(+) ions and peroxide content, with their maximum increment after salt treatment. The amplification of oxidative damages was further stimulated by the accumulation of putrescine and lipid peroxidation-derived toxic degradation products (increased malondialdehyde and lipoxygenase activity), which were comparable in M-1-48 and Gobindobhog. Antioxidants like anthocyanin and particularly cysteine and the osmolytes like reducing sugar, proline and polyamines (spermidine and spermine) showed the highest level in Nonabokra. While the inhibition of catalase activity occurred in all the varieties following salt-stress, the maximum induction in guaiacol peroxidase activity, elevated cysteine and proline levels in Gobindobhog probably constituted the detoxification mechanism obligatory for its survival. Intensification of the aroma content with salt treatment was markedly noted in Gobindobhog. A very low abundance of Rab16A/SamDC transcript and the corresponding proteins were observed both in M-1-48 and Gobindobhog, induced only after salt-stress, whereas they were constitutively expressed in Nonabokra. Thus, our data reflect Gobindobhog as a salt-sensitive cultivar, susceptible to high-stress-induced growth-inhibition, ion imbalances, membrane/oxidative damages with lower expression of stress-tolerant genes.
18704694	Inactivation of an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for fragrance in rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Rice (Oryza sativa) has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs, BAD1 and BAD2, encoded on chromosome four and chromosome eight respectively. BAD2 is responsible for the characteristic aroma of fragrant rice. Complementary DNA clones of both BAD1 and BAD2 were isolated and expressed in E. coli. BAD2 had optimum activity at pH 10, little to no affinity towards N-acetyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (NAGABald) with a Km of approximately 10 mM and moderate affinity towards gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde (GGBald) and betaine aldehyde (bet-ald) with Km values of approximately 260 microM and 63 microM respectively. A lower Km of approximately 9 microM was observed with gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (GABald), suggesting BAD2 has a higher affinity towards this substate in vivo. The enzyme encoded on chromosome four, BAD1, had optimum activity at pH 9.5, showed little to no affinity towards bet-ald with a Km of 3 mM and had moderate affinity towards GGBald, NAGABald and GABald with Km values of approximately 545, 420 and 497 microM respectively. BAD1 had a half life roughly double that of BAD2. We discuss the implications of these findings on the pathway of fragrance generation in Basmati and Jasmine rice and the potential of rice to accumulate the osmoprotectant glycine betaine.
18852152	Divergence of evolutionary ways among common sym genes: CASTOR and CCaMK show functional conservation between two symbiosis systems and constitute the root of a common signaling pathway.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	In recent years a number of legume genes involved in root nodule (RN) symbiosis have been identified in the model legumes, Lotus japonicus (Lotus) and Medicago truncatula. Among them, a distinct set of genes has been categorized as a common symbiosis pathway (CSP), because they are also essential for another mutual interaction, the arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis, which is evolutionarily older than the RN symbiosis and is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Based on the concept that the legume RN symbiosis has evolved from the ancient AM symbiosis, one issue is whether the CSP is functionally conserved between non-nodulating plants, such as rice, and nodulating legumes. We identified three rice CSP gene orthologs, OsCASTOR, OsPOLLUX and OsCCaMK, and demonstrated the indispensable roles of OsPOLLUX and OsCCaMK in rice AM symbiosis. Interestingly, molecular transfection of either OsCASTOR or OsCCaMK could fully complement symbiosis defects in the corresponding Lotus mutant lines for both the AM and RN symbioses. Our results not only provide a conserved genetic basis for the AM symbiosis between rice and Lotus, but also indicate that the core of the CSP has been well conserved during the evolution of RN symbiosis. Through evolution, CASTOR and CCaMK have remained as the molecular basis for the maintenance of CSP functions in the two symbiosis systems.
18978069	Antiquity and function of CASTOR and POLLUX, the twin ion channel-encoding genes key to the evolution of root symbioses in plants.	2009	Plant Physiol	Root symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobial bacteria share a common signaling pathway in legumes. Among the common symbiosis genes are CASTOR and POLLUX, the twin homologous genes in Lotus japonicus that encode putative ion channel proteins. Here, we show that the orthologs of CASTOR and POLLUX are ubiquitously present and highly conserved in both legumes and nonlegumes. Using rice (Oryza sativa) as a study system, we employ reverse genetic tools (knockout mutants and RNA interference) to demonstrate that Os-CASTOR and Os-POLLUX are indispensable for mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice. Furthermore, a cross-species complementation test indicates that Os-POLLUX can restore nodulation, but not rhizobial infection, to a Medicago truncatula dmi1 mutant.
19033192	Hybrid male sterility in rice controlled by interaction between divergent alleles of two adjacent genes.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Sterility is common in hybrids between divergent populations, such as the indica and japonica subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). Although multiple loci for plant hybrid sterility have been identified, it remains unknown how alleles of the loci interact at the molecular level. Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively. Most indica cultivars contain a haplotype SaM(+)SaF(+), whereas all japonica cultivars have SaM(-)SaF(-) that diverged by nucleotide variations in wild rice. Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM(-). This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility. Lack of any one of the three alleles in recombinant plants does not produce male sterility. We propose a two-gene/three-component interaction model for this hybrid male sterility system. The findings have implications for overcoming male sterility in inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding.
19033527	Arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signaling in rice transcends the common symbiosis signaling pathway.	2008	Plant Cell	Knowledge about signaling in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses is currently restricted to the common symbiosis (SYM) signaling pathway discovered in legumes. This pathway includes calcium as a second messenger and regulates both AM and rhizobial symbioses. Both monocotyledons and dicotyledons form symbiotic associations with AM fungi, and although they differ markedly in the organization of their root systems, the morphology of colonization is similar. To identify and dissect AM-specific signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), we developed molecular phenotyping tools based on gene expression patterns that monitor various steps of AM colonization. These tools were used to distinguish common SYM-dependent and -independent signaling by examining rice mutants of selected putative legume signaling orthologs predicted to be perturbed both upstream (CASTOR and POLLUX) and downstream (CCAMK and CYCLOPS) of the central, calcium-spiking signal. All four mutants displayed impaired AM interactions and altered AM-specific gene expression patterns, therefore demonstrating functional conservation of SYM signaling between distant plant species. In addition, differential gene expression patterns in the mutants provided evidence for AM-specific but SYM-independent signaling in rice and furthermore for unexpected deviations from the SYM pathway downstream of calcium spiking.
17893721	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a dynamic rolled leaf gene, RL10(t), in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Genome	A dynamically rolled leaf mutant (rl10) was identified from a spontaneous mutation in an Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica line, II-32B. The leaf chlorophyll content of rl10 is higher than that of the wild type. Genetic analysis using 3 F2 segregating populations derived from crosses between rl10 and the rice lines Mian5B, II-32B, and D62B, respectively, confirmed that the rolled leaf trait of rl10 is controlled by a single recessive gene. Of 719 SSR primer pairs that showed polymorphism between D62B and rl10, 151 were adopted to map the RL10(t) gene using an F2 segregating population of the cross rl10 x D62B, which contained 352 recessive plants. RL10(t) was primarily mapped on the long arm of chromosome 9, 5.09 cM from marker RM105 and 5.13 cM from marker RM3912. Using a novel set of 22 primer pairs between RM105 and RM3912, RL10(t) was further mapped between markers rlc3 (0.72 cM in distance) and rlc12 (0.1 cM in distance) using an F2/F3 population containing 1172 recessive individuals. Mapped position analysis and homology analysis of the 20 genes within the 194-kb region between these 2 markers both indicated that a gene encoding a Myb-like domain transcription factor with homology to Arabidopsis KANADI (annotated in PAC clone AP005904) is the most probable candidate for RL10(t). This study enables further investigation of whether KANADI-like Myb genes are involved in leaf polarity modeling in monocots, as they are in dicots.
19011003	A germin-like protein gene family functions as a complex quantitative trait locus conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae. Natural selection may have preserved a whole gene family to provide a stepwise, flexible defense response to pathogen invasion.
19104064	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a significant yield constraint in rice-growing areas of South and Southeast Asia. Disease symptoms are caused largely by infection by the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF2a and RF2b had essentially no impact on plant development. Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration. Furthermore, transgenic plants exhibited reduced accumulation of RTBV RNA and viral DNA compared with nontransgenic plants. Similar results were obtained in studies after virus inoculation by green leafhoppers. Gaining disease resistance by elevating the expression of host regulators provides another strategy against RTD and may have implications for other pararetrovirus infections.
17086445	Retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in CW-CMS of rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	The CW-cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) line has the cytoplasm of Oryza rufipogon Griff, and mature pollen is morphologically normal under an optical microscope but lacks the ability to germinate; restorer gene Rf17 has been identified as restoring this ability. The difference between nuclear gene expression in mature anthers was compared for the CW-CMS line, [cms-CW] rf17rf17, and a maintainer line with normal cytoplasm of Oryza sativa L., [normal] rf17rf17. Using a 22-k rice oligoarray we detected 58 genes that were up-regulated more than threefold in the CW-CMS line. Expression in other organs was further investigated for 20 genes using RT-PCR. Five genes, including genes for alternative oxidase, were found to be preferentially expressed in [cms-CW] rf17rf17 but not in [normal] rf17rf17 or [cms-CW] Rf17Rf17. Such [cms-CW] rf17rf17-specific gene expression was only observed in mature anthers but not in leaves, stems, or roots, indicating the presence of anther-specific mitochondrial retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression, and that Rf17 has a role in restoring the ectopic gene expression. We also used a proteomic approach to discover the retrograde regulated proteins and identified six proteins that were accumulated differently. These results reveal organ-specific induced mitochondrial retrograde pathways affecting nuclear gene expression possibly related to CMS.
18301900	Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) with a rice chitinase gene for improved tolerance to a fungal pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Taro (Colocasia esculenta) is one of the most important crops in the Pacific Islands, however, taro yields have been declining in Hawaii over the past 30 years partly due to diseases caused by oomycete and fungal pathogens. In this study, an efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method for taro is first reported. In total, approximately 200 pieces (8 g) of embryogenic calluses were infected with the super-virulent A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring the plant transformation plasmid pBI121/ricchi11 that contains the rice chitinase gene ricchi11. The presence and expression of the transgene ricchi11 in six independent transgenic lines was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Southern blot analysis of the six independent lines indicated that three out of six (50%) had integrated a single copy of the transgene, and the other three lines had two or three copies of the transgene. Compared to the particle bombardment transformation of taro method, which was used in the previous studies, the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method obtained 43-fold higher transformation efficiency. In addition, these six transgenic lines via Agrobacterium may be more effective for transgene expression as a result of single-copy or low-copy insertion of the transgene than the single line with multiple copies of the transgene via particle bombardment. In a laboratory bioassay, all six transgenic lines exhibited increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii, ranging from 42 to 63% reduction in lesion expansion.
17333504	The expression of iron homeostasis-related genes during rice germination.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	To characterize Fe homeostasis during the early stages of seed germination, a microarray analysis was performed. mRNAs extracted from fully mature seeds or seeds harvested 1-3 days after sowing were hybridized to a rice microarray containing approximately 22,000 cDNA oligo probes. Many Fe deficiency-inducible genes were strongly expressed throughout early seed germination. These results suggest that the demand for Fe is extremely high during germination. Under Fe-deficient conditions, rice produces and secretes a metal-cation chelator called deoxymugineic acid (DMA) to acquire Fe from the soil. In addition, DMA and its intermediate nicotianamine (NA) are thought to be involved in long distance Fe transport in rice. Using promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis, we investigated the expression patterns during seed germination of the Fe deficiency-inducible genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3, OsNAAT1, and OsDMAS1, which encode enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of DMA, and the transporter genes OsYSL2 and OsIRT1, which are involved in Fe transport. All of these genes were expressed in germinating seeds prior to protrusion of the radicle. These results suggest that DMA and NA are produced and involved in Fe transport during germination.
17406793	Identification of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase isoforms essential for starch synthesis in the leaf and seed endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Plant Mol Biol	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes the first committed step of starch biosynthesis in higher plants. To identify AGP isoforms essential for this biosynthetic process in sink and source tissues of rice plants, we analyzed the rice AGP gene family which consists of two genes, OsAGPS1 and OsAGPS2, encoding small subunits (SSU) and four genes, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL2, OsAGPL3 and OsAGPL4, encoding large subunits (LSU) of this enzyme heterotetrameric complex. Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs indicate that OsAGPS2a, the product of the leaf-preferential transcript of OsAGPS2, and OsAGPS1, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL3, and OsAGPL4 are plastid-targeted isoforms. In contrast, two isoforms, SSU OsAGPS2b which is a product of a seed-specific transcript of OsAGPS2, and LSU OsAGPL2, are localized in the cytosol. Analysis of osagps2 and osagpl2 mutants revealed that a lesion of one of the two cytosolic isoforms, OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b, causes a shrunken endosperm due to a remarkable reduction in starch synthesis. In leaves, however, only the osagps2 mutant appears to severely reduce the transitory starch content. Interestingly, the osagps2 mutant was indistinguishable from wild type during vegetative plant growth. Western blot analysis of the osagp mutants and wild type plants demonstrated that OsAGPS2a is an SSU isoform mainly present in leaves, and that OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 are the major SSU and LSU isoforms, respectively, in the endosperm. Finally, we propose a spatiotemporal complex model of OsAGP SSU and LSU isoforms in leaves and in developing endosperm of rice plants.
17468002	Expression profiling of Oryza sativa metal homeostasis genes in different rice cultivars using a cDNA macroarray.	2007	Plant Physiol Biochem	Rice is an important food crop, but it is a poor source of essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc. In order to improve the metal ion content of rice grains through breeding or biotechnology, more information is needed on the molecular players that help mobilize metals from leaves to developing seeds. To profile several genes simultaneously, a cDNA macroarray was developed using 36 metal-related genes from rice, including ZIPs, NRAMPs, and YSLs (coding for known or potential metal transporters), as well as NAS, FER, FRO, NAAT, FDH, GSTU, and PDR (involved in metal homeostasis). Because flag leaves are the major source of phloem-delivered photoassimilates and remobilized metals for developing seeds, we analyzed the expression of these metal-related genes in flag and non-flag leaves of four different rice cultivars (Cocodrie, Taipei 309, IR58, and IR68144) during the period of mid-grain fill. Genes (24 of 36) exhibited low to non-detectable signals in the macroarray, while 12 genes (OsIRT1, OsZIP1, OsZIP5, OsZIP8, OsYSL5, OsYSL6, OsYSL7, OsYSL8, OsYSL18, OsNRAMP2, OsNRAMP4 and OsNRAMP7) were found to be highly expressed in both flag and non-flag leaves of all four cultivars. Additional expression analysis using semi-quantitative or quantitative PCR provided results that were generally consistent with the macroarray, but semi-quantitative PCR confirmed that OsFDH, OsFER1, OsNAAT, OsNAS1, OsPDR9, OsYSL12, OsYSL13, OsZIP7, and OsZIP10 were also expressed in leaves. This specialized macroarray has provided a short list of potential candidate genes, expressed in leaves, which might contribute to the process of metal transport to distant sinks, such as seeds.
18160413	Phytohormone abscisic acid control RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 gene expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing in rice cells.	2008	Nucleic Acids Res	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) catalyses dsRNA synthesis for post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS)-associated amplification and the generation of endogeneous siRNAs involved in developmental determinations or stress responses. The functional importance of RDR6 in PTGS led us to examine its connection to the cellular regulatory network by analyzing the hormonal responses of RDR6 gene expression in a cultured cell system. Delivery of dsRNA, prepared in vitro, into cultured rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica Dongjin) cells successfully silenced the target isocitrate lyase (ICL) transcripts. Silencing was transient in the absence of abscisic acid (ABA), while it became persistent in the presence of ABA in growth medium. A transcription assay of the OsRDR6 promoter showed that it was positively regulated by ABA. OsRDR6-dependent siRNA(ICL) generation was also significantly up-regulated by ABA. The results showed that, among the five rice OsRDR isogenes, only OsRDR6 was responsible for the observed ABA-mediated amplification and silencing of ICL transcripts. We propose that ABA modulates PTGS through the transcriptional control of the OsRDR6 gene.
18217708	Herbicide-induced anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic rice by expression of rice OSB2 under the control of rice CYP72A21 promoter.	2008	J Agric Food Chem	CYP72A21, a rice cytochrome P450 gene, is induced by chloroacetamide herbicides. OSB2, a rice myc-type transcription factor, induces anthocyanin accumulation in rice leaves. To produce plants for biomonitoring by color change, we combined the CYP72A21 promoter and the OSB2 gene and introduced them into the rice isogenic line Taichung-65 CB A (T65), which contains loci CB and A from the rice cultivar Murasakiine. Leaves of the transgenic plants turned red upon treatment with the chloroacetamide herbicides acetochlor, alachlor, and metolachlor. Seedling shoots reddened upon treatment with alachlor or metolachlor at 10 microM, a concentration slightly higher than that used in the field. Anthocyanin content was increased approximately 200% by the treatment. The color changes were consistent with increased shoot expression of OSB2 and the anthocyanidin synthase gene (ANS). This system promises easy detection of rice plant gene expression. Transgenic plants could be used in the future to biomonitor accumulated herbicides.
18224446	Deoxymugineic acid increases Zn translocation in Zn-deficient rice plants.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Deoxymugineic acid (DMA) is a member of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), which are natural metal chelators produced by graminaceous plants. Rice secretes DMA in response to Fe deficiency to take up Fe in the form of Fe(III)-MAs complex. In contrast with barley, the roots of which secrete MAs in response to Zn deficiency, the amount of DMA secreted by rice roots was slightly decreased under conditions of low Zn supply. There was a concomitant increase in endogenous DMA in rice shoots, suggesting that DMA plays a role in the translocation of Zn within Zn-deficient rice plants. The expression of OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 was not increased in Zn-deficient roots but that of OsNAS3 was increased in Zn-deficient roots and shoots. The expression of OsNAAT1 was also increased in Zn-deficient roots and dramatically increased in shoots; correspondingly, HPLC analysis was unable to detect nicotianamine in Zn-deficient shoots. The expression of OsDMAS1 was increased in Zn-deficient shoots. Analyses using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS) showed that Zn-deficient rice roots absorbed less (62)Zn-DMA than (62)Zn(2+). Importantly, supply of (62)Zn-DMA rather than (62)Zn(2+) increased the translocation of (62)Zn into the leaves of Zn-deficient plants. This was especially evident in the discrimination center (DC). These results suggest that DMA in Zn-deficient rice plants has an important role in the distribution of Zn within the plant rather than in the absorption of Zn from the soil.
18700826	The Arabidopsis AtNPR1 inversely modulates defense responses against fungal, bacterial, or viral pathogens while conferring hypersensitivity to abiotic stresses in transgenic rice.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (NPR1) protein plays an important role in mediating defense responses activated by pathogens in Arabidopsis. In rice, a disease-resistance pathway similar to the Arabidopsis NPR1-mediated signaling pathway one has been described. Here, we show that constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis NPR1 (AtNPR1) gene in rice confers resistance against fungal and bacterial pathogens. AtNPR1 exerts its protective effects against fungal pathogens by priming the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-responsive endogenous genes, such as the PR1b, TLP (PR5), PR10, and PBZ1. However, expression of AtNPR1 in rice has negative effects on viral infections. The AtNPR1-expressing rice plants showed a higher susceptibility to infection by the Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) which correlated well with a misregulation of RYMV-responsive genes, including expression of the SA-regulated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 gene (OsRDR1). Moreover, AtNPR1 negatively regulates the expression of genes playing a role in the plant response to salt and drought stress (rab21, salT, and dip1), which results in a higher sensitivity of AtNPR1 rice to the two types of abiotic stress. These observations suggest that AtNPR1 has both positive and negative regulatory roles in mediating defense responses against biotic and abiotic stresses.
18726614	Functional characterization of key structural genes in rice flavonoid biosynthesis.	2008	Planta	Rice is a model system for monocot but the molecular features of rice flavonoid biosynthesis have not been extensively characterized. Rice structural gene homologs encoding chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) were identified by homology searches. Unique differential expression of OsF3H, OsDFR, and OsANS1 controlled by the Pl(w) locus, which contains the R/B-type regulatory genes OSB1 and OSB2, was demonstrated during light-induced anthocyanin accumulation in T65-Plw seedlings. Previously, F3H genes were often considered as early genes co-regulated with CHS and CHI genes in other plants. In selected non-pigmented rice lines, OSB2 is not expressed following illumination while their expressed OSB1sequences all contain the same nucleotide change leading to the T(64) M substitution within the conserved N-terminal interacting domain. Furthermore, the biochemical roles of the expressed rice structural genes (OsCHS1, OsCHI, OsF3H, and OsF3'H) were established in planta for the first time by complementation in the appropriate Arabidopsis transparent testa mutants. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, OsCHS1 was demonstrated to interact physically with OsF3H, OsF3'H, OsDFR, and OsANS1, suggesting the existence of a macromolecular complex for anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice. Finally, flavones were identified as the major flavonoid class in the non-pigmented T65 seedlings in which the single-copy OsF3H gene was not expressed. Competition between flavone and anthocyanin pathways was evidenced by the significant reduction of tricin accumulation in the T65-Plw seedlings.
18761634	OsIPD3, an ortholog of the Medicago truncatula DMI3 interacting protein IPD3, is required for mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	2008	New Phytol	Medicago truncatula IPD3 (MtIPD3) is an interacting protein of DMI3 (does not make infections 3), a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) essential for both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and rhizobial symbioses. However, the function of MtIPD3 in root symbioses has not been demonstrated in M. truncatula, because of a lack of knockout mutants for functional analysis. In this study, the availability of IPD3 knockout mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) was exploited to test the function of OsIPD3 in AM symbiosis. Three independent retrotransposon Tos17 insertion lines of OsIPD3 were selected and the phenotypes characterized upon inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices. Phenotypic and genetic analyses revealed that the Osipd3 mutants were unable to establish a symbiotic association with G. intraradices. In conclusion, IPD3 represents a novel gene required for root symbiosis with AM fungi in plants.
18826656	Genome-wide identification, organization and phylogenetic analysis of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase gene families and their expression analysis during reproductive development and stress in rice.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Important developmental processes in both plants and animals are partly regulated by genes whose expression is modulated at the post-transcriptional level by processes such as RNA interference (RNAi). Dicers, Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) form the core components that facilitate gene silencing and have been implicated in the initiation and maintenance of the trigger RNA molecules, central to process of RNAi. Investigations in eukaryotes have revealed that these proteins are encoded by variable number of genes with plants showing relatively higher number in each gene family. To date, no systematic expression profiling of these genes in any of the organisms has been reported.

RESULTS: In this study, we provide a complete analysis of rice Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families including gene structure, genomic localization and phylogenetic relatedness among gene family members. We also present microarray-based expression profiling of these genes during 14 stages of reproductive and 5 stages of vegetative development and in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress. We have identified 8 Dicer-like (OsDCLs), 19 Argonaute (OsAGOs) and 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (OsRDRs) genes in rice. Based on phylogeny, each of these genes families have been categorized into four subgroups. Although most of the genes express both in vegetative and reproductive organs, 2 OsDCLs, 14 OsAGOs and 3 OsRDRs were found to express specifically/preferentially during stages of reproductive development. Of these, 2 OsAGOs exhibited preferential up-regulation in seeds. One of the Argonautes (OsAGO2) also showed specific up-regulation in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress.

CONCLUSION: This investigation has identified 23 rice genes belonging to DCL, Argonaute and RDR gene families that could potentially be involved in reproductive development-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. These data provide an insight into probable domains of activity of these genes and a basis for further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of RNA silencing machinery during reproductive phase of plant development.
18830621	Transcriptional profiling of the PDR gene family in rice roots in response to plant growth regulators, redox perturbations and weak organic acid stresses.	2008	Planta	The role of plant pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters remains poorly understood. We characterized the expression of the rice pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) gene family in roots, where PDR transporters are believed to have major functions. A prototypical oligonucleotide array was developed containing 70-mers chosen in the gene-specific 3' untranslated regions of the rice PDR genes, other full-molecule rice ABC transporter genes and relevant marker genes. Jasmonates, which are involved in plant defense and secondary metabolism, proved major inducers of PDR gene expression. Over half of the PDR genes were JA-induced in roots of rice; OsPDR9 to the highest level. Salicylic acid, involved in plant pathogen defense, markedly induced the expression of OsPDR20. OsPDR20 was cDNA cloned and characterized. Abscisic acid, typically involved in water deficit responses, particularly induced OsPDR3 in roots and shoot and OsPDR6 in rice leaves. OsPDR9 and OsPDR20 were furthermore up-regulated in response to dithiothreitol- or glutathione-induced redox perturbations. Exogenous application of the weak organic acids lactic acid, malic acid, and citric acid differentially induced the expression of OsPDR3, OsPDR8, OsPDR9 and OsPDR20 in rice seedling roots. This transcriptional survey represents a guide for the further functional analysis of individual PDR transporters in roots of rice.
19017626	Novel cysteine-rich peptides from Digitaria ciliaris and Oryza sativa enhance tolerance to cadmium by limiting its cellular accumulation.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	By means of functional screening using the cadmium (Cd)-sensitive ycf1 yeast mutant, we have isolated a novel cDNA clone, DcCDT1, from Digitaria ciliaris growing in a former mining area in northern Japan, and have shown that it confers Cd tolerance to the yeast cells, which accumulated almost 2-fold lower Cd levels than control cells. The 521 bp DcCDT1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 168 bp and encodes a deduced peptide, DcCDT1, that is 55 amino acid residues in length, of which 15 (27.3%) are cysteine residues. Five DcCDT1 homologs (here termed OsCDT1-OsCDT5) have been identified in rice, and all of them were up-regulated to varying degrees in the above-ground tissues by CdCl(2) treatment. Localization of green fluorescent protein fusions suggests that DcCDT1 and OsCDT1 are targeted to both cytoplasmic membranes and cell walls of plant cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing DcCDT1 or OsCDT1 displayed a Cd-tolerant phenotype and, consistent with our yeast data, accumulated lower amounts of Cd when grown on CdCl(2). Collectively, our data suggest that DcCDT1 and OsCDT1 function to prevent entry of Cd into yeast and plant cells and thereby enhance their Cd tolerance.
19049971	Rice OsYSL15 is an iron-regulated iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter expressed in the roots and is essential for iron uptake in early growth of the seedlings.	2009	J Biol Chem	Graminaceous plants take up iron through YS1 (yellow stripe 1) and YS1-like (YSL) transporters using iron-chelating compounds known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores. We examined the expression of 18 rice (Oryza sativa L.) YSL genes (OsYSL1-18) in the epidermis/exodermis, cortex, and stele of rice roots. Expression of OsYSL15 in root epidermis and stele was induced by iron deficiency and showed daily fluctuation. OsYSL15 restored a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when supplied with iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid and transported iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid in Xenopus laevis oocytes. An OsYSL15-green fluorescent protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. OsYSL15 promoter-beta-glucuronidase analysis revealed that OsYSL15 expression in roots was dominant in the epidermis/exodermis and phloem cells under conditions of iron deficiency and was detected only in phloem under iron sufficiency. These results strongly suggest that OsYSL15 is the dominant iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter responsible for iron uptake from the rhizosphere and is also responsible for phloem transport of iron. OsYSL15 was also expressed in flowers, developing seeds, and in the embryonic scutellar epithelial cells during seed germination. OsYSL15 knockdown seedlings showed severe arrest in germination and early growth and were rescued by high iron supply. These results demonstrate that rice OsYSL15 plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis during the early stages of growth.
19052152	Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability.	2009	Plant Physiol	Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) catalyze the irreversible oxidation of a wide range of reactive aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Although the proteins have been studied from various organisms and at different growth stages, their roles in seed development have not been well elucidated. We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses. Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage. Extracts from the mutant seeds showed a maximum absorbance peak at 360 nm, the wavelength that melanoidin absorbs. Under UV light, those extracts also exhibited much stronger fluorescence than the wild type, suggesting that the pigments are melanoidin. These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly. Purified OsALDH7 protein showed enzyme activities to malondialdehyde, acetaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde. These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation. The mutant seeds were more sensitive to our accelerated aging treatment and accumulated more malondialdehyde than the wild type. These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation.
19099599	Conservation and implications of eukaryote transcriptional regulatory regions across multiple species.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows that whole genomes of eukaryotes are almost entirely transcribed into both protein coding genes and an enormous number of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Therefore, revealing the underlying regulatory mechanisms of transcripts becomes imperative. However, for a complete understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we need to identify the regions in which they are found. We will call these transcriptional regulation regions, or TRRs, which can be considered functional regions containing a cluster of regulatory elements that cooperatively recruit transcriptional factors for binding and then regulating the expression of transcripts.

RESULTS: We constructed a hierarchical stochastic language (HSL) model for the identification of core TRRs in yeast based on regulatory cooperation among TRR elements. The HSL model trained based on yeast achieved comparable accuracy in predicting TRRs in other species, e.g., fruit fly, human, and rice, thus demonstrating the conservation of TRRs across species. The HSL model was also used to identify the TRRs of genes, such as p53 or OsALYL1, as well as microRNAs. In addition, the ENCODE regions were examined by HSL, and TRRs were found to pervasively locate in the genomes.

CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that 1) the HSL model can be used to accurately predict core TRRs of transcripts across species and 2) identified core TRRs by HSL are proper candidates for the further scrutiny of specific regulatory elements and mechanisms. Meanwhile, the regulatory activity taking place in the abundant numbers of ncRNAs might account for the ubiquitous presence of TRRs across the genome. In addition, we also found that the TRRs of protein coding genes and ncRNAs are similar in structure, with the latter being more conserved than the former.
16263903	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice.	2005	J Exp Bot	Zinc (Zn) is an essential element for the normal growth of plants but information is scarce on the mechanisms whereby Zn is transported in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants. Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated. Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots. Real-time-PCR revealed that the OsZIP4 transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots. OsZIP4 complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that OsZIP4 is a functional transporter of Zn. OsZIP4-synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) fusion protein was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells localized to the plasma membrane. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsZIP4 in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells. Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots. These results suggested that OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants.
17630290	Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants.	2007	J Exp Bot	Zinc (Zn), an essential nutrient in cells, plays a vital role in controlling cellular processes such as growth, development, and differentiation. Although the mechanisms of Zn translocation in rice plants (Oryza sativa) are not fully understood, it has recently received increased interest. OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsZIP4 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced. The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots. The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S-OsZIP4 plants was four times lower compared with vector controls. Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls. Microarray analysis revealed that the genes expressed in shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants coincided with those induced in shoots of Zn-deficient plants. These results indicate that constitutive expression of OsZIP4 changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that OsZIP4 is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated.
18038191	Cloning and functional identification of two members of the ZIP (Zrt, Irt-like protein) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Mol Biol Rep	Two ZIP (Zrt, Irt-like Protein) cDNAs were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by RT-PCR approach, and named as OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 respectively. The predicted proteins of OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 consist of 384 and 390 amino acid residues respectively, and display high similarity to other plant ZIP proteins. Each protein contains eight transmembrane (TM) domains and a highly conserved ZIP signature motif, with a histidine-rich region in the variable region between TM domains III and IV. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach, it was found that the expression of OsZIP7a was significantly induced in rice roots by iron-deficiency, while that of OsZIP8 induced in both rice roots and shoots by zinc-deficiency. When expressed in yeast cells, OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 could complement an iron-uptake-deficient yeast mutant and a zinc-uptake-deficient yeast mutant respectively. It suggested that the OsZIP7a and OsZIP8 might encode an iron and a zinc transporter protein in rice respectively.
18071708	Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2008	Plant Cell Rep	Plant productivity is greatly influenced by various environmental stresses, such as high salinity and drought. Earlier, we reported the isolation of topoisomerase 6 homologs from rice and showed that over expression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In this study, we have assessed the function of nuclear-localized topoisomerase 6 subunit A homolog, OsTOP6A1, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed reduced sensitivity to stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration at the seed germination; seedling and adult stages as reflected by the percentage of germination, fresh weight of seedlings and leaf senescence assay, respectively. Concomitantly, the expression of many stress-responsive genes was enhanced under various stress conditions in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of genes involved in various processes of plant growth and development and stress responses was altered in transgenic plants. Although AtSPO11-1, the homolog of OsTOP6A1 in Arabidopsis, has been implicated in meiotic recombination; the present study demonstrates possible additional role of OsTOP6A1 and provides an effective tool for engineering crop plants for tolerance to different environmental stresses.
18707797	Transport functions and expression analysis of vacuolar membrane aquaporins in response to various stresses in rice.	2008	J Plant Physiol	The vacuole, a multifunctional organelle of most plant cells, has very important roles in space filling, osmotic adjustment, storage and digestion. Previous researches suggested that aquaporins in the tonoplast were involved in vacuolar functions. The rice genome contains 33 aquaporin genes, 10 of which encode tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs). However, the function of each individual TIP isoform and the integrated function of TIPs under various physiological conditions remain elusive. Here, five rice TIP members were characterized with water and/or glycerol transport activities using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. OsTIP1;2, OsTIP2;2, OsTIP4;1 and OsTIP5;1 possessed water transport activity. OsTIP1;2, OsTIP3;2 and OsTIP4;1 were demonstrated with glycerol transport activity. Rice TIP expression patterns under various abiotic stress conditions including dehydration, high salinity, abscisic acid (ABA) and during seed germination were investigated by real-time PCR. OsTIP1s (OsTIP1;1 and OsTIP1;2) were highly expressed during seed germination, whereas OsTIP3s (OsTIP3;1 and OsTIP3;2) were specifically expressed in mature seeds with a decrease in expression levels upon germination. The results of this research provided a functional and expression profiles of rice TIPs.
19458265	Suppressed expression of Retrograde-Regulated Male Sterility restores pollen fertility in cytoplasmic male sterile rice plants.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Conflict/reconciliation between mitochondria and nuclei in plants is manifested by the fate of pollen (viable or nonviable) in the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)/fertility restoration (Rf) system. Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE-REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L.). RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of RMS restored fertility to a CMS plant, whereas its overexpression in the fertility restorer line induced pollen abortion. The mRNA expression level of RMS in mature anthers depended on cytoplasmic genotype, suggesting that RMS is a candidate gene to be regulated via retrograde signaling. We found that a reduced-expression allele of the RMS gene restored fertility in haploid pollen, whereas a normal-expression allele caused pollen to die in the CW-type CMS. RMS encodes a mitochondrial protein, 178 aa in length, of unknown function, unlike the majority of other Rf genes cloned thus far, which encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. The unique features of RMS provide novel insights into retrograde signaling and CMS.
18940787	Two adjacent nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat class genes are required to confer Pikm-specific rice blast resistance.	2008	Genetics	The rice blast resistance gene Pikm was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy. High-resolution genetic mapping and sequencing of the gene region in the Pikm-containing cultivar Tsuyuake narrowed down the candidate region to a 131-kb genomic interval. Sequence analysis predicted two adjacently arranged resistance-like genes, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS, within this candidate region. These genes encoded proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and were considered the most probable candidates for Pikm. However, genetic complementation analysis of transgenic lines individually carrying these two genes negated the possibility that either Pikm1-TS or Pikm2-TS alone was Pikm. Instead, it was revealed that transgenic lines carrying both of these genes expressed blast resistance. The results of the complementation analysis and an evaluation of the resistance specificity of the transgenic lines to blast isolates demonstrated that Pikm-specific resistance is conferred by cooperation of Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS. Although these two genes are not homologous with each other, they both contain all the conserved motifs necessary for an NBS-LRR class gene to function independently as a resistance gene.
19298266	Diversification in flowering time due to tandem FT-like gene duplication, generating novel Mendelian factors in wild and cultivated rice.	2009	Mol Ecol	The complex structure of a single Mendelian factor widespread in the Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild progenitor (Oryza rufipogon) that caused diverse phenotypes in the timing of flowering under natural field conditions was investigated in near isogenic lines. These near isogenic lines showed differences in flowering time despite all eight accessions collected from tropical regions possessing a recessive gene allelic to the se-pat gene. Fine mapping in two of these near-isogenic lines revealed that cultivated (Patpaku) and wild (W593) accessions had three and two linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the candidate regions, respectively, showing that Patpaku and W593 possessed linked QTLs with different effects in addition to the commonly-observed recessive gene (se-pat). Molecular dissection suggested that the tandemly duplicated FT-like genes (Hd3a and RFT1) could be the candidate genes for these QTLs. Interestingly, the linked QTLs differed in their epistases, degree of dominance, and genotype x environment interactions. The nucleotide sequences showed that RFT1 has diverged more rapidly than Hd3a during rice evolution, suggesting phenotypic diversification of the two genes. Phylogenetic analysis implied that the se-pat(+) alleles might have emerged in different lineages within O. sativa. The present results strongly suggest that nucleotide divergence and shuffling of the linked QTLs by recombination might have created novel Mendelian factors that probably contribute to responding to local environments.
19244140	A bacterial-type ABC transporter is involved in aluminum tolerance in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major factor limiting crop production in acidic soil, but the molecular mechanisms of Al tolerance are poorly understood. Here, we report that two genes, STAR1 (for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1) and STAR2, are responsible for Al tolerance in rice. STAR1 encodes a nucleotide binding domain, while STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain, of a bacterial-type ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Disruption of either gene resulted in hypersensitivity to aluminum toxicity. Both STAR1 and STAR2 are expressed mainly in the roots and are specifically induced by Al exposure. Expression in onion epidermal cells, rice protoplasts, and yeast showed that STAR1 interacts with STAR2 to form a complex that localizes to the vesicle membranes of all root cells, except for those in the epidermal layer of the mature zone. When expressed together in Xenopus laevis oocytes, STAR1/2 shows efflux transport activity specific for UDP-glucose. Furthermore, addition of exogenous UDP-glucose rescued root growth in the star1 mutant exposed to Al. These results indicate that STAR1 and STAR2 form a complex that functions as an ABC transporter, which is required for detoxification of Al in rice. The ABC transporter transports UDP-glucose, which may be used to modify the cell wall.
19071208	Identification of a high frequency transposon induced by tissue culture, nDaiZ, a member of the hAT family in rice.	2009	Genomics	Recent completion of rice genome sequencing has revealed that more than 40% of its genome consists of repetitive sequences, and most of them are related to inactive transposable elements. In the present study, a transposable element, nDaiZ0, which is induced by tissue culture with high frequency, was identified by sequence analysis of an allelic line of the golden hull and internode 2 (gh2) mutant, which was integrated into the forth exon of GH2. The 528-bp nDaiZ0 has 14-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and generates an 8-bp duplication of its target sites (TSD) during its mobilization. nDaiZs are non-autonomous transposons and have no coding capacity. Bioinformatics analysis and southern blot hybridization showed that at least 16 copies of nDaiZ elements exist in the japonica cultivar Nipponbare genome and 11 copies in the indica cultivar 93-11 genome. During tissue culture, only one copy, nDaiZ9, located on chromosome 5 in the genome of Nipponbare can be activated with its transposable frequency reaching 30%. However, nDaiZ9 was not present in the 93-11 genome. The larger elements, DaiZs, were further identified by database searching using nDaiZ0 as a query because they share similar TIRs and subterminal sequences. DaiZ can also generate an 8-bp TSD. DaiZ elements contain a conserved region with a high similarity to the hAT dimerization motif, suggesting that the nDaiZ-DaiZ transposon system probably belongs to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that it is a new type of plant hAT-like transposon. Although nDaiZ is activated by tissue culture, the high transposable frequency indicates that it could become a useful gene tagging system for rice functional genomic studies. In addition, the mechanism of the high transposable ability of nDaiZ9 is discussed.
19305410	Natural variation at the DEP1 locus enhances grain yield in rice.	2009	Nat Genet	Grain yield is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in many crop plants. Here we report the molecular characterization of a major rice grain yield QTL that acts through the determination of panicle architecture. The dominant allele at the DEP1 locus is a gain-of-function mutation causing truncation of a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-like domain protein. The effect of this allele is to enhance meristematic activity, resulting in a reduced length of the inflorescence internode, an increased number of grains per panicle and a consequent increase in grain yield. This allele is common to many Chinese high-yielding rice varieties and likely represents a relatively recent introduction into the cultivated rice gene pool. We also show that a functionally equivalent allele is present in the temperate cereals and seems to have arisen before the divergence of the wheat and barley lineages.
19228340	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice.	2009	Plant J	Most aerial parts of the plant body are products of the continuous activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Leaves are the major component of the aerial plant body, and their temporal and spatial distribution mainly determines shoot architecture. Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron). PLA3/GO encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase, which is thought to catabolize small acidic peptides and produce small signaling molecules. pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase. However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology. Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis. Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly. Our results suggest that PLA3 modulates various signaling pathways associated with a number of developmental processes.
19181864	Heterologous expression analyses of rice OsCAS in Arabidopsis and in yeast provide evidence for its roles in cyanide detoxification rather than in cysteine synthesis in vivo.	2009	J Exp Bot	While most dicot plants produce little ethylene in their vegetative stage, many monocots such as rice liberate a relatively large amount of ethylene with cyanide as a co-product in their seedling stage when etiolated. One of the known functions of beta-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS) is to detoxify the co-product cyanide during ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. Based on a tryptic peptide sequence obtained from a partially purified CAS activity protein preparation in etiolated rice seedlings, the full-length putative rice CAS-encoding cDNA sequence (OsCAS), which is homologous to those O-acetylserine sulphydrylase (OASS) genes, was cloned. Unlike most of the CAS genes reported from dicots, the transcription of OsCAS is promoted by auxins but suppressed by ethylene. To address the function and the subcellular localization of this gene product in planta, a binary vector construct consisting of this gene appended with a yellow fluorescent protein-encoding sequence was employed to transform Arabidopsis. Specific activities on CAS and OASS of the purified recombinant protein from transgenic Arabidopsis were 181.04 micromol H(2)S mg(-1) protein min(-1) and 0.92 micromol Cys mg(-1) protein min(-1), respectively, indicating that OsCAS favours CAS activity. The subcellular localization of OsCAS was found mostly in the mitochondria by immunogold electron-microscopy. Chemical cross-linking and in-gel assay on a heterodimer composed of functional and non-functional mutants in a yeast expression system on OsCAS suggested that OsCAS functions as a homodimer, similar to that of OASS. Despite the structural similarity of OsCAS with OASS, it has also been confirmed that OsCAS could not interact with serine-acetyltransferase, indicating that OsCAS mainly functions in cyanide detoxification.
19164767	Comparative sequence analysis of MONOCULM1-orthologous regions in 14 Oryza genomes.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to decipher gene and genome evolution. Placing multiple genome comparisons in a phylogenetic context improves the sensitivity of evolutionary inferences. In the genus Oryza, this comparative approach can be used to investigate gene function, genome evolution, domestication, polyploidy, and ecological adaptation. A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids. Sequencing and annotation of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for these species revealed highly conserved gene colinearity and structure in the MOC1 region. Since the Oryza radiation about 14 Mya, differences in transposon amplification appear to be responsible for the different current sizes of the Oryza genomes. In the MOC1 region, transposons were only conserved between genomes of the same type (e.g., AA or BB). In addition to the conserved gene content, several apparent genes have been generated de novo or uniquely retained in the AA lineage. Two different 3-gene segments have been inserted into the MOC1 region of O. coarctata (KK) or O. sativa by unknown mechanism(s). Large and apparently noncoding sequences flanking the MOC1 gene were observed to be under strong purifying selection. The allotetraploids Oryza alta and Oryza minuta were found to be products of recent polyploidization, less than 1.6 and 0.4 Mya, respectively. In allotetraploids, pseudogenization of duplicated genes was common, caused by large deletions, small frame-shifting insertions/deletions, or nonsense mutations.
14645724	Monitoring expression profiles of rice genes under cold, drought, and high-salinity stresses and abscisic acid application using cDNA microarray and RNA gel-blot analyses.	2003	Plant Physiol	To identify cold-, drought-, high-salinity-, and/or abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we prepared a rice cDNA microarray including about 1700 independent cDNAs derived from cDNA libraries prepared from drought-, cold-, and high-salinity-treated rice plants. We confirmed stress-inducible expression of the candidate genes selected by microarray analysis using RNA gel-blot analysis and finally identified a total of 73 genes as stress inducible including 58 novel unreported genes in rice. Among them, 36, 62, 57, and 43 genes were induced by cold, drought, high salinity, and ABA, respectively. We observed a strong association in the expression of stress-responsive genes and found 15 genes that responded to all four treatments. Venn diagram analysis revealed greater cross talk between signaling pathways for drought, ABA, and high-salinity stresses than between signaling pathways for cold and ABA stresses or cold and high-salinity stresses in rice. The rice genome database search enabled us not only to identify possible known cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of several stress-inducible genes but also to expect the existence of novel cis-acting elements involved in stress-responsive gene expression in rice stress-inducible promoters. Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis and rice showed that among the 73 stress-inducible rice genes, 51 already have been reported in Arabidopsis with similar function or gene name. Transcriptome analysis revealed novel stress-inducible genes, suggesting some differences between Arabidopsis and rice in their response to stress.
18435825	Suppression mechanism of mitochondrial ORF79 accumulation by Rf1 protein in BT-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice.	2008	Plant J	SUMMARY: In BT-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Chinsurah Boro II cytoplasm, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is caused by an accumulation of the cytotoxic peptide ORF79. The ORF79 protein is expressed from a dicistronic gene atp6-orf79, which exists in addition to the normal atp6 gene in the BT-type mitochondrial genome. The CMS is restored by a PPR (pentatricopeptide-repeat) gene, Rf1, via RNA processing. However, it has not yet been elucidated how the accumulation of ORF79 is reduced by the action of the Rf1 protein. Here, we report that the level of processed orf79 transcripts in the restorer line was reduced to 50% of the unprocessed atp6-orf79 transcripts in the CMS line. Ninety percent of the processed orf79 transcripts, which remained after degradation, were not associated with the ribosome for translation. Our data suggests that the processing of atp6-orf79 transcripts diminishes the expression of orf79 by the translational reduction and degradation of the processed orf79 transcripts.
2151651	Four tightly linked rab genes are differentially expressed in rice.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	We have cloned and sequenced the four members of a rice rab (responsive to abscisic acid) gene family that are tandemly arrayed in a locus approximately 30 kbp in length. Each of the genes contains a single, small intron. They are all transcriptionally active and encode proteins of Mr 15,500-16,800 with two highly conserved domains. Northern analysis with gene-specific probes showed slightly different patterns of expression for the four genes in rice plant tissues and in response to osmotic stress. Comparison of the promoter regions revealed a conserved GC-rich sequence (CGG/CCGCGCT) with some homology to the SP1 binding site (Briggs et al., 1986). Another conserved sequence (PuTACGTGGCPu), whose core is found in the promoter regions of ABA-responsive cotton genes, is reminiscent of the cAMP responsive element (Deutsch et al., 1988).
16668800	Regulation of Em Gene Expression in Rice : Interaction between Osmotic Stress and Abscisic Acid.	1992	Plant Physiol	Expression of the Em gene was characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.) suspension cultures following exposure of the cultures to various combinations of abscisic acid (ABA) and salt. Response-saturating concentrations of either ABA (50 micromolar) or NaCl (0.4 molar) rapidly induced (by 60 minutes) the accumulation of Em mRNA, with a maximum accumulation occurring 12 to 24 hours after treatment. NaCl-induced Em expression was accompanied by a doubling of endogenous ABA levels as determined by immunoassay. Inhibition of ABA biosynthesis by fluridone during NaCl treatment reduced the levels of endogenous ABA by fourfold and Em expression by 50%. Desiccation of the cultures to 12 to 15% of their initial fresh weight increased endogenous ABA more than twofold and was accompanied by an increase in Em mRNA levels. Exposure of the cultures to heat shock temperatures, chilling, or ultraviolet light neither increased endogenous ABA levels nor induced Em expression. When a subthreshold or saturating level of NaCl was added in combination with increasing levels of ABA, Em transcripts were detected at ABA concentrations that alone did not induce expression of Em. Treatment with saturating levels of both NaCl and ABA resulted in a doubling of Em transcript levels over the maximum signal for each treatment alone. Hence, our data suggested that salt interacted synergistically with ABA, in part because of the increased sensitivity of rice cells to ABA. The effect of salt stress on Em gene expression in rice suspension cells appeared to operate through two pathways: one is mediated through increases in the level of ABA; the other is via a unique salt response pathway that includes an intermediate that is common to both the salt and ABA response chains.
8819309	Rice embryo globulins: amino-terminal amino acid sequences, cDNA cloning and expression.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	A globulin fraction prepared from rice embryos contained polypeptides or polypeptide groups of 49 kDa (designated REG1), 46 kDa (designated REG2), about 35 kDa, 32 kDa and 25 kDa. The amino-terminal sequences of REG1 and the major polypeptide in the 35-kDa group were identical, suggesting that the REG1 polypeptide undergoes partial proteolytic processing that removes a carboxy-terminal region. A cDNA clone, designated pcREG2, encoding REG2 was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of REG2 was found to be 68% identical to that of the maize GLB2 globulin. Reg2 mRNA was present at high levels during embryo development for up to 14 days after flowering (DAF). Lower levels were found 20 DAF when the maturation of embryos was almost completed, and at the dry mature stage. Reg2 mRNA almost disappeared upon imbibition of isolated dry mature embryos but it was re-induced at a low level by further treatment with ABA. The expression of Reg2 was not induced by ABA in suspension-cultured cells, unlike that of Osem, one of the late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA) genes.
16152656	Proteomic analysis of rice embryo: an approach for investigating Galpha protein-regulated proteins.	2005	Proteomics	The rice dwarf1 (d1) mutant, which lacks the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha protein), shows abnormal morphology due to shortened internodes, dark green leaves and grains that are small and round. Proteome analysis was used in this study to aid in determining the function of Galpha protein in rice embryos. Using 2-DE, seven seed embryo proteins were shown to be down-regulated in the d1 mutant as compared with its wild type. These seven proteins included a receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) and six rice embryo globulin-2 proteins (REG2). The six REG2 have similar molecular masses with minor differences in pI. In addition to the reduced accumulation of RACK in the d1 mutant, the increase in QL/d1, in which a constitutively active form of the Galpha protein is expressed, was significantly higher as compared with wild type. The level of accumulation of these seven proteins during seed development and maturation did not change significantly until the 2nd wk after pollination. Reduced accumulation of these seven proteins started in the d1 mutant at the 3rd wk after pollination, and continued until seed maturation was complete. All seven proteins were completely absent 24 h after imbibition in both d1 mutant and its wild type. However, the phytohormone abscisic acid promoted the expression level of RACK after imbibition in the wild type as compared with d1 mutant. These results suggest that RACK is regulated by Galpha-protein and plays an important role in a basic cellular process as well as in rice embryogenesis and germination.
2137613	Nuclear proteins bind conserved elements in the abscisic acid-responsive promoter of a rice rab gene.	1990	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We have previously shown that the expression of a rice gene, rab-16A, is responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress in plant tissues and cultured suspension cells. We demonstrate here that transcriptional elements between -294 and -52 of this gene are sufficient to confer ABA-dependent expression on the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in rice protoplasts. Sequence motifs within this 242-base-pair region of the rab-16A gene are conserved among the 5' upstream regions of other ABA-responsive genes. Gel retardation and DNAse I experiments show nuclear factor(s) binding to these sequences. This correlative data indicate that these motifs are involved in the transcription of the rab genes and suggest that they may be ABA-responsive-elements (ABREs).
10767423	Transcript levels of the nuclear-encoded respiratory genes in rice decrease by oxygen deprivation: evidence for involvement of calcium in expression of the alternative oxidase 1a gene.	2000	FEBS Lett	We investigated the effect of oxygen on the expressions of respiratory genes encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Hypoxic treatment decreased the transcript levels of nuclear-encoded, but not mitochondrial-encoded respiratory genes. The effects of ruthenium red (an inhibitor of Ca(2+) fluxes from organelles) and/or CaCl(2) on plants under hypoxic conditions suggested that Ca(2+) is a physiological transducer of a low-oxygen signaling pathway for expression of the alternative oxidase 1a gene (AOX1a), but not for expressions of genes involved in the cytochrome respiratory pathway, in rice.
12036102	AOX1c, a novel rice gene for alternative oxidase; comparison with rice AOX1a and AOX1b.	2002	Genes Genet Syst	A novel gene for alternative oxidase (AOX) was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence of the novel AOX gene contains features that are conserved among other AOXs. This AOX gene was designated AOX1c based on a phylogenetic analysis of the AOX genes. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that AOX1c and AOX1a/AOX1b transcripts accumulated differently in various rice organs and rice seedlings under low temperature conditions. AOX1c mRNA was mainly present in young leaves under constant light, mature leaves and panicles after heading, but it was not detected in young etiolated leaves and young roots of seedlings or young panicles. On the other hand, the mRNAs of the rice AOX1a and AOX1b genes were mainly present in young roots and mature leaves. Under low temperature conditions, the steady-state mRNA levels of the rice AOX1a and AOX1b genes clearly increased with time but the rice AOX1c gene was apparently not responsive to low temperature. The rice AOX gene family and differences in their regulation are discussed.
11971906	Ternary complex formation between MADS-box transcription factors and the histone fold protein NF-YB.	2002	J Biol Chem	MADS-box proteins are transcription factors present in different eukaryotic kingdoms. In contrast to plants, for mammalian and yeast MADS-box proteins ternary complex formation with unrelated transcription factors was reported. We show here the first identification of such ternary interaction in plants. A rice seed-specific NF-YB was identified as partner of OsMADS18 by two-hybrid screening. NF-YB contains a histone fold motif, HFM,(1) and is part of the trimeric CCAAT-binding NF-Y complex. OsMADS18, alone or in combination with a natural partner, interacts with OsNF-YB1 through the MADS and I regions. The mouse NF-YB also associates with OsMADS18 in vivo and in vitro as a NF-YB-NF-YC dimer. Other rice MADS-box proteins do not interact in these assays, indicating specificity for the interaction. OsNF-YB1 is capable of heterodimerizing with NF-YC, but not trimerizing with NF-YA, thus precluding CCAAT binding. Mutation of the variant Asp at position 99 of the HFM alpha2-helix into a conserved serine recovers the capacity to interact with NF-YA, but not with DNA. This is the first indication that members of the NF-YB family work through mechanisms independent of the CCAAT box.
19249065	Occurrence of D-serine in rice and characterization of rice serine racemase.	2009	Phytochemistry	Germinated, unpolished rice was found to contain a substantial amount of D-serine, with the ratio of the D-enantiomer to the L-enantiomer being higher for serine than for other amino acids. The relative amount of D-serine (D/(D+L)%) reached approximately 10% six days after germination. A putative serine racemase gene (serr, clone No. 001-110-B03) was found in chromosome 4 of the genomic DNA of Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. This was expressed as serr in Escherichia coli and its gene product (SerR) was purified to apparent homogeneity. SerR is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 34.5kDa, and is highly specific for serine. In addition to a serine racemase reaction, SerR catalyzes D- and L-serine dehydratase reactions, for which the specific activities were determined to be 2.73 and 1.42nkatal/mg, respectively. The optimum temperature and pH were respectively determined for the racemase reaction (35 degrees C and pH9.0) and for the dehydratase reaction (35 degrees C and pH9.5). SerR was inhibited by PLP-enzyme inhibitors. ATP decreased the serine racemase activity of SerR but increased the serine dehydratase activity. Kinetic analysis showed that Mg(2+) increases the catalytic efficiency of the serine racemase activity of SerR and decreases that of the serine dehydratase activity. Fluorescence-quenching analysis of the tryptophan residues in SerR indicated that the structure of SerR is distorted by the addition of Mg(2+), and this structural change probably regulates the two enzymatic activities.
19215594	Identification of a rice actin2 gene regulatory region for high-level expression of transgenes in monocots.	2009	Plant Biotechnol J	We have isolated and characterized the 5' region of the rice actin2 gene (OsAct2), which contains 793 bp of sequence upstream of the OsAct2 transcription initiation site, 58 bp of the first non-coding exon, 1736 bp of the 5' intron and the first 8 bp (non-coding sequence) of the second exon. It was found that the 5' region of OsAct2 is an efficient gene regulatory region for driving the constitutive expression of foreign genes in transgenic rice. In situ histochemical results indicated that OsAct2::GUS (GUS, beta-glucuronidase) gene expression in transgenic rice plants is high in sporophytic and gametophytic tissues. It was demonstrated that a 2.6-kb upstream sequence of the OsAct2 translation initiation codon contains all of the 5' regulatory elements necessary for high-level gus expression in transgenic rice tissues. OsAct2 promoter activity was significantly enhanced by the deletion of a 1590-bp segment from the central region of the first intron. The +96 to +274 region of the intron negatively regulates gus expression in leaves. To identify regulatory elements within the OsAct2 promoter, nested truncations of the promoter region were made and fused to gus. The results showed that the region from -1 to -376 was sufficient for promoter activity. In addition, two OsAct2-based expression vectors for use in monocot transformation were developed to promote the high-level expression of foreign genes.
19207212	Rice open beak is a negative regulator of class 1 knox genes and a positive regulator of class B floral homeotic gene.	2009	Plant J	Numerous genes are involved in the regulation of plant development, including those that regulate floral homeotic genes, We identified two recessive allelic rice mutants, open beak-1 (opb-1) and opb-2, which exhibited pleiotropic defects in leaf morphogenesis, inflorescence architecture, and floral organ identity. Abnormal cell proliferation was observed in the leaves and spikelets, and ectopic or overexpression of several class 1 knox genes was detected; thus, the abnormal cell proliferation in opb mutants is probably caused by ectopic class 1 knox gene expression. The opb mutants also had defects in floral organ identity, resulting in the development of mosaic organs, including gluminous lodicules, staminoid lodicules, and pistiloid stamens. These results, together with the reduced expression of a class B gene, indicate that OPB positively regulates the expression of class B genes. Map-based cloning revealed that OPB encodes a transcription factor that is orthologous to the Arabidopsis JAGGED gene and is expressed in leaf primordia, inflorescence meristem, rachis branch meristems, floral meristem, and floral organ primordia. Taken together, our data suggest that the OPB gene affects cellular proliferation and floral organ identity through the regulation of class 1 knox genes and floral homeotic genes.
18943978	Rice Pi-ta gene Confers Resistance to the Major Pathotypes of the Rice Blast Fungus in the United States.	2004	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT The Pi-ta gene in rice prevents the infection by Magnaporthe grisea strains containing the AVR-Pita avirulence gene. The presence of Pi-ta in rice cultivars was correlated completely with resistance to two major pathotypes, IB-49 and IC-17, common in the U.S. blast pathogen population. The inheritance of resistance to IC-17 was investigated further using a marker for the resistant Pi-ta allele in an F(2) population of 1,345 progeny from a cross of cv. Katy with experimental line RU9101001 possessing and lacking, respectively, the Pi-ta resistance gene. Resistance to IC-17 was conferred by a single dominant gene and Pi-ta was not detected in susceptible individuals. A second F(2) population of 377 individuals from a reciprocal cross between Katy and RU9101001 was used to verify the conclusion that resistance to IC-17 was conferred by a single dominant gene. In this cross, individuals resistant to IC-17 also were resistant to IB-49. The presence of Pi-ta and resistance to IB-49 also was correlated with additional crosses between 'Kaybonnet' and 'M-204', which also possess and lack Pi-ta, respectively. A pair of primers that specifically amplified a susceptible pi-ta allele was developed to verify the absence of Pi-ta. We suggest that Pi-ta is responsible for resistance to IB-49 and IC-17 and that both races contain AVR-Pita genes.
19153255	Rice Pi5-mediated resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae requires the presence of two coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat genes.	2009	Genetics	Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. To understand the molecular basis of Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae, we cloned the resistance (R) gene at this locus using a map-based cloning strategy. Genetic and phenotypic analyses of 2014 F2 progeny from a mapping population derived from a cross between IR50, a susceptible rice cultivar, and the RIL260 line carrying Pi5 enabled us to narrow down the Pi5 locus to a 130-kb interval. Sequence analysis of this genomic region identified two candidate genes, Pi5-1 and Pi5-2, which encode proteins carrying three motifs characteristic of R genes: an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) motif, a nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. In genetic transformation experiments of a susceptible rice cultivar, neither the Pi5-1 nor the Pi5-2 gene was found to confer resistance to M. oryzae. In contrast, transgenic rice plants expressing both of these genes, generated by crossing transgenic lines carrying each gene individually, conferred Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae. Gene expression analysis revealed that Pi5-1 transcripts accumulate after pathogen challenge, whereas the Pi5-2 gene is constitutively expressed. These results indicate that the presence of these two genes is required for rice Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.
19167778	Salt-inducible isoform of plasma membrane H+ATPase gene in rice remains constitutively expressed in natural halophyte, Suaeda maritima.	2009	J Plant Physiol	To look into a possible involvement of plasma membrane H+ATPase (PM-H+ATPase, EC 3.6.3.6) in mitigation of physiological disturbances imposed by salt stress, response of the enzyme was studied in two Oryza sativa Indica cultivars, salt-tolerant Lunishri and non-tolerant Badami, and a natural halophyte Suaeda maritima after challenge of the young plants with NaCl. Significant increase in activity of the enzyme was observed in response to NaCl in all the test plants with S. maritima showing maximum increase. Protein blot analysis, however, did not show any increase in the amount of the enzyme (protein). RNA blot analysis, on the other hand, revealed significant increase in transcript level of the enzyme upon NaCl treatment. In the rice cultivars, salt treatment also induced expression of a new isoform of PM-H+ATPase gene, not reported so far. The induced transcript showed maximum homology to OSA7 (O. sativa PM-H+ATPase isoform 7). Similar transcript message, however, remained constitutively present in S. maritima, along with the transcript of another isoform of PM-H+ATPase showing resemblance to OSA3 (O. sativa PM-H+ATPase isoform 3). The latter was the only PM-H+ATPase isoform expressed in both the rice cultivars not exposed to NaCl. In the salt-treated test plants, both rice and S. maritima, the salt-inducible PM-H+ATPase isoform resembling OSA7 was expressed in much greater amount than that resembling OSA3. Appearance of a new PM-H+ATPase transcript, besides increase in the enzyme activity, indicates the important role of the enzyme in maintaining ion-homeostasis in plants under salt stress, enabling them to survive under saline conditions.
19000005	Haplotype diversity at the Pi-ta locus in cultivated rice and its wild relatives.	2008	Phytopathology	The Pi-ta gene in rice confers resistance to races of Magnaporthe oryzae that contain AVR-Pita. Pi-ta encodes a predicted cytoplasmic receptor protein with a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich domain. A panel of 51 Oryza accessions of AA genome species Oryza sativa, O. glaberrima, O. rufipogon, O. nivara, and O. barthii, and CC genome species O. officinalis were sequenced to investigate the diversity present in the exon and intron regions of the Pi-ta gene. Two major clades were identified, consisting of 16 different sequences with numerous insertion and deletions. Only one Pi-ta resistance allele was identified despite DNA sequences revealing 16 Pi-ta variants. Most differences were identified in the intron region, and obvious selection of any motif was not observed in the coding region of Pi-ta variants. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of seedlings revealed that all Pi-ta variants were expressed with or without pathogen inoculation. The 15 Pi-ta variants can be translated into nine proteins highly similar to the Pi-ta protein. Resistance to M. oryzae expressing AVR-Pita correlates with alanine and susceptibility correlates with serine at position 918 of Pi-ta in most accessions examined. These data confirm that a single amino acid controlling resistance specificity underlies the evolution of resistance of Pi-ta genes in rice.
19240804	A rice gene of de novo origin negatively regulates pathogen-induced defense response.	2009	PLoS One	How defense genes originated with the evolution of their specific pathogen-responsive traits remains an important problem. It is generally known that a form of duplication can generate new genes, suggesting that a new gene usually evolves from an ancestral gene. However, we show that a new defense gene in plants may evolve by de novo origination, resulting in sophisticated disease-resistant functions in rice. Analyses of gene evolution showed that this new gene, OsDR10, had homologs only in the closest relative, Leersia genus, but not other subfamilies of the grass family; therefore, it is a rice tribe-specific gene that may have originated de novo in the tribe. We further show that this gene may evolve a highly conservative rice-specific function that contributes to the regulation difference between rice and other plant species in response to pathogen infections. Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease. This enhanced disease resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA) and suppressed accumulation of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) as well as modified expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. These data and analyses provide fresh insights into the new biologic and evolutionary processes of a de novo gene recruited rapidly.
19297585	Rice virescent3 and stripe1 encoding the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase are required for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development.	2009	Plant Physiol	The virescent3 (v3) and stripe1 (st1) mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) produce chlorotic leaves in a growth stage-dependent manner under field conditions. They are temperature-conditional mutants that produce bleached leaves at a constant 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C but almost green leaves under diurnal 30 degrees C/20 degrees C conditions. Here, we show V3 and St1, which encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), RNRL1, and RNRS1, respectively. RNR regulates the rate of deoxyribonucleotide production for DNA synthesis and repair. RNRL1 and RNRS1 are highly expressed in the shoot base and in young leaves, and the expression of the genes that function in plastid transcription/translation and in photosynthesis is altered in v3 and st1 mutants, indicating that a threshold activity of RNR is required for chloroplast biogenesis in developing leaves. There are additional RNR homologs in rice, RNRL2 and RNRS2, and eukaryotic RNRs comprise alpha(2)beta(2) heterodimers. In yeast, RNRL1 interacts with RNRS1 (RNRL1:RNRS1) and RNRL2:RNRS2, but no interaction occurs between other combinations of the large and small subunits. The interacting activities are RNRL1:RNRS1 > RNRL1:rnrs1(st1) > rnrl1(v3):RNRS1 > rnrl1(v3):rnrs1(st1), which correlate with the degree of chlorosis for each genotype. This suggests that missense mutations in rnrl1(v3) and rnrs1(st1) attenuate the first alphabeta dimerization. Moreover, wild-type plants exposed to a low concentration of an RNR inhibitor, hydroxyurea, produce chlorotic leaves without growth retardation, reminiscent of v3 and st1 mutants. We thus propose that upon insufficient activity of RNR, plastid DNA synthesis is preferentially arrested to allow nuclear genome replication in developing leaves, leading to continuous plant growth.
19290563	Genetic signature of rice domestication shown by a variety of genes.	2009	J Mol Evol	Cultivated rice was domesticated from common wild rice. However, little is known about genetic adaptation under domestication. We investigated the nucleotide variation of both cultivated rice and its wild progenitors at 22 R-gene and 10 non-R-gene loci. A significant regression was observed between wild rice and rice cultivars in their polymorphic levels, particularly in their nonsynonymous substitutions (theta ( a )). Our data also showed that a similar proportion (approximately 60%) of nucleotide variation in wild rice was retained in cultivated rice in both R-genes and non-R-genes. Interestingly, the slope always was >1 and the intercept always >0 in linear regressions when a cultivar's polymorphism was x-axis. The slope and intercept values can provide a basis by which to estimate the founder effect and the strength of artificial direct selection. A larger founder effect than previously reported and a strong direct-selection effect were shown in rice genes. In addition, two-directional selection was commonly found in differentiated genes between indica and japonica rice subspecies. This kind of selection may explain the mosaic origins of indica and japonica rice subspecies. Furthermore, in most R-genes, no significant differentiation between cultivated and wild rice was detected. We found evidence for genetic introgression from wild rice, which may have played an important role during the domestication of rice R-genes.
19484258	Chloroplast-targeted expression of synthetic cry1Ac in transgenic rice as an alternative strategy for increased pest protection.	2009	Planta	To increase insect resistance in transgenic rice plants, a synthetic truncated cry1Ac gene was linked to the rice rbcS promoter and its transit peptide sequence (tp) for chloroplast-targeted expression. Several transgenic lines were generated by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method and the expression levels of the transgene were compared with untargeted expression. Use of the rbcS-tp sequence increased the cry1Ac transcript and protein levels by 25- and 100-fold, respectively, with the accumulated protein in chloroplasts comprising up to 2% of the total soluble proteins. The high level of cry1Ac expression resulted in high levels of plant resistance to three common rice pests, rice leaf folder, rice green caterpillar, and rice skipper, as evidenced by insect feeding assays. Transgenic plants were also evaluated for resistance to natural infestations by rice leaf folder under field conditions. Throughout the entire period of plant growth, the transgenic plants showed no symptoms of damage, whereas nontransgenic control plants were severely damaged by rice leaf folders. Our results demonstrate that the targeting of cry1Ac protein to the chloroplast using the rbcS:tp system confers a high level of plant protection to insects, thus providing an alternative strategy for crop insect management.
19482918	Diversity in expression patterns and functional properties in the rice HKT transporter family.	2009	Plant Physiol	Plant growth under low K(+) availability or salt stress requires tight control of K(+) and Na(+) uptake, long-distance transport, and accumulation. The family of membrane transporters named HKT (for High-Affinity K(+) Transporters), permeable either to K(+) and Na(+) or to Na(+) only, is thought to play major roles in these functions. Whereas Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) possesses a single HKT transporter, involved in Na(+) transport in vascular tissues, a larger number of HKT transporters are present in rice (Oryza sativa) as well as in other monocots. Here, we report on the expression patterns and functional properties of three rice HKT transporters, OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;3, and OsHKT2;1. In situ hybridization experiments revealed overlapping but distinctive and complex expression patterns, wider than expected for such a transporter type, including vascular tissues and root periphery but also new locations, such as osmocontractile leaf bulliform cells (involved in leaf folding). Functional analyses in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed striking diversity. OsHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;3, shown to be permeable to Na(+) only, are strongly different in terms of affinity for this cation and direction of transport (inward only or reversible). OsHKT2;1 displays diverse permeation modes, Na(+)-K(+) symport, Na(+) uniport, or inhibited states, depending on external Na(+) and K(+) concentrations within the physiological concentration range. The whole set of data indicates that HKT transporters fulfill distinctive roles at the whole plant level in rice, each system playing diverse roles in different cell types. Such a large diversity within the HKT transporter family might be central to the regulation of K(+) and Na(+) accumulation in monocots.
19480680	Detection and validation of single feature polymorphisms using RNA expression data from a rice genome array.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: A large number of genetic variations have been identified in rice. Such variations must in many cases control phenotypic differences in abiotic stress tolerance and other traits. A single feature polymorphism (SFP) is an oligonucleotide array-based polymorphism which can be used for identification of SNPs or insertion/deletions (INDELs) for high throughput genotyping and high density mapping. Here we applied SFP markers to a lingering question about the source of salt tolerance in a particular rice recombinant inbred line (RIL) derived from a salt tolerant and salt sensitive parent.

RESULTS: Expression data obtained by hybridizing RNA to an oligonucleotide array were analyzed using a statistical method called robustified projection pursuit (RPP). By applying the RPP method, a total of 1208 SFP probes were detected between two presumed parental genotypes (Pokkali and IR29) of a RIL population segregating for salt tolerance. We focused on the Saltol region, a major salt tolerance QTL. Analysis of FL478, a salt tolerant RIL, revealed a small (< 1 Mb) region carrying alleles from the presumed salt tolerant parent, flanked by alleles matching the salt sensitive parent IR29. Sequencing of putative SFP-containing amplicons from this region and other positions in the genome yielded a validation rate more than 95%.

CONCLUSION: Recombinant inbred line FL478 contains a small (< 1 Mb) segment from the salt tolerant parent in the Saltol region. The Affymetrix rice genome array provides a satisfactory platform for high resolution mapping in rice using RNA hybridization and the RPP method of SFP analysis.
19476655	Molecular characterization of a rice mutator-phenotype derived from an incompatible cross-pollination reveals transgenerational mobilization of multiple transposable elements and extensive epigenetic instability.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Inter-specific hybridization occurs frequently in plants, which may induce genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids, allopolyploids and introgressants. It remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an incompatible species may impose a "biological stress" even in the absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked.

RESULTS: We report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, Oryza sativa L. and Oenothera biennis L. The mutator-phenotype (named Tong211-LP) showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged panicles. Expectably, gel-blotting by total genomic DNA of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression. Characterization of Tong211-LP (S0) and its selfed progenies (S1) ruled out contamination (via seed or pollen) or polyploidy as a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized transposable elements (TEs), including a MITE (mPing), and three LTR retrotransposons (Osr7, Osr23 and Tos17). AFLP and MSAP fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic variation in Tong211-LP and its immediate progenies. mPing mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration detected by MSAP but not with genetic variation detected by AFLP. Assay by q-RT-PCR of the steady-state transcript abundance of a set of genes encoding for the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, and small interference RNA (siRNA) pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in expression of 12 out of the 13 genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies.

CONCLUSION: Transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated TE activity occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of O. biennis. Heritably perturbed homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome merger or genetic introgression.
19474214	Refining the definition of plant mitochondrial presequences through analysis of sorting signals, N-terminal modifications, and cleavage motifs.	2009	Plant Physiol	Mitochondrial protein import is a complex multistep process from synthesis of proteins in the cytosol, recognition by receptors on the organelle surface, to translocation across one or both mitochondrial membranes and assembly after removal of the targeting signal, referred to as a presequence. In plants, import has to further discriminate between mitochondria and chloroplasts. In this study, we determined the precise cleavage sites in the presequences for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial proteins using mass spectrometry by comparing the precursor sequences with experimental evidence of the amino-terminal peptide from mature proteins. We validated this method by assessments of false-positive rates and comparisons with previous available data using Edman degradation. In total, the cleavable presequences of 62 proteins from Arabidopsis and 52 proteins from rice mitochondria were determined. None of these proteins contained amino-terminal acetylation, in contrast to recent findings for chloroplast stromal proteins. Furthermore, the classical matrix glutamate dehydrogenase was detected with intact and amino-terminal acetylated sequences, indicating that it is imported into mitochondria without a cleavable targeting signal. Arabidopsis and rice mitochondrial presequences had similar isoelectric points, hydrophobicity, and the predicted ability to form an amphiphilic alpha-helix at the amino-terminal region of the presequence, but variations in length, amino acid composition, and cleavage motifs for mitochondrial processing peptidase were observed. A combination of lower hydrophobicity and start point of the amino-terminal alpha-helix in mitochondrial presequences in both Arabidopsis and rice distinguished them (98%) from Arabidopsis chloroplast stroma transit peptides. Both Arabidopsis and rice mitochondrial cleavage sites could be grouped into three classes, with conserved -3R (class II) and -2R (class I) or without any conserved (class III) arginines. Class II was dominant in both Arabidopsis and rice (55%-58%), but in rice sequences there was much less frequently a phenylalanine (F) in the -1 position of the cleavage site than in Arabidopsis sequences. Our data also suggest a novel cleavage motif of (F/Y) downward arrow(S/A) in plant class III sequences.
19473328	Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice.	2009	Plant J	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo. To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF). The accumulation of most SSPs changed little between individual KD mutants and wild-type plants, whereas a double KD mutant (KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF) resulted in a significant reduction of most SSP gene expression and accumulation. The reduction of both trans-activators also caused a greater reduction in seed starch accumulation than individual KD mutants. Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds. KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells. Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF. These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling. The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice. Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
19472976	Developing rice embryo proteomics reveals essential role for embryonic proteins in regulation of seed germination.	2009	J Proteome Res	Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry was utilized to unravel the changes in embryo proteins of geminating rice seeds. For this purpose, the embryos were dissected at 1 and 2 days after imbibition and germination of mature dry seeds. Proteins were extracted and their expression patterns were analyzed by large-format 2-DGE. A total of 642 silver nitrate stained protein spots were detected on 2-D gels, subjected to image analysis using the ImageMaster 6.0 2D Platinum software, resulting in the identification of 109 differentially expressed protein spots compared with imbibed seeds. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis resulted in the identification of 60 proteins, including 6 redundant and 54 nonredundant proteins. The identified proteins were classified according to their functional groups: metabolism (15 spots), oxygen-detoxifying (11 spots), protein processing/degradation (8 spots), stress/defense (5 spots), and energy (3 spots). Northern blot analysis demonstrated a good correlation between the mRNA expression profile and 2-DGE results for 27 proteins. Furthermore, Western blot analysis was used to confirm the high expression patterns of ascorbate peroxidase b (OsAPxb, spot 12/13) and l-ascorbate peroxidase 1 (OsAPx1, spot 17/27) in the embryo as compared with the endosperm of dry seeds. Present results suggest that seed germination is related with multiple regulations of functional proteins. For example, proteins related to metabolism (i.e., glycolysis and TCA cycle) are essential for the energy supply. On the other hand, oxygen-detoxifying proteins and stress/defense related proteins may take part in an important role in adaptation to environmental conditions during seed germination.
19470656	Subcellular localization and expression of multiple tomato gamma-aminobutyrate transaminases that utilize both pyruvate and glyoxylate.	2009	J Exp Bot	Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) catalyses the breakdown of GABA to succinic semialdehyde. In this report, three GABA-T isoforms were identified in the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plant. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three isoforms are highly similar over most of their coding regions with the exception of their N-terminal regions. Transient expression of the individual full-length GABA-T isoforms fused to the green fluorescent protein in tobacco suspension-cultured cells revealed their distinct subcellular localizations to the mitochondrion, plastid or cytosol, and that the specific targeting of the mitochondrion- and plastid-localized isoforms is mediated by their predicted N-terminal presequences. Removal of the N-terminal targeting presequences from the mitochondrion and plastid GABA-T isoforms yielded good recovery of the soluble recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli when they were co-expressed with the GroES/EL molecular chaperone complex. Activity assays indicated that all three recombinant isoforms possess both pyruvate- and glyoxylate-dependent GABA-T activities, although the mitochondrial enzyme has a specific activity that is significantly higher than that of its plastid and cytosolic counterparts. Finally, differential expression patterns of the three GABA-T isoforms in reproductive tissues, but not vegetative tissues, suggest unique roles for each enzyme in developmental processes. Overall, these findings, together with recent information about rice and pepper GABA-Ts, indicate that the subcellular distribution of GABA-T in the plant kingdom is highly variable.
19470589	DWARF27, an iron-containing protein required for the biosynthesis of strigolactones, regulates rice tiller bud outgrowth.	2009	Plant Cell	Tillering in rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important agronomic traits that determine grain yields. Previous studies on rice tillering mutants have shown that the outgrowth of tiller buds in rice is regulated by a carotenoid-derived MAX/RMS/D (more axillary branching) pathway, which may be conserved in higher plants. Strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, have been recently identified as products of the MAX/RMS/D pathway that inhibits axillary bud outgrowth. We report here the molecular genetic characterization of d27, a classic rice mutant exhibiting increased tillers and reduced plant height. D27 encodes a novel iron-containing protein that localizes in chloroplasts and is expressed mainly in vascular cells of shoots and roots. The phenotype of d27 is correlated with enhanced polar auxin transport. The phenotypes of the d27 d10 double mutant are similar to those of d10, a mutant defective in the ortholog of MAX4/RMS1 in rice. In addition, 2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol, an identified strigolactone in root exudates of rice seedlings, was undetectable in d27, and the phenotypes of d27 could be rescued by supplementation with GR24, a synthetic strigolactone analog. Our results demonstrate that D27 is involved in the MAX/RMS/D pathway, in which D27 acts as a new member participating in the biosynthesis of strigolactones.
19468840	OsYSL18 is a rice iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter specifically expressed in reproductive organs and phloem of lamina joints.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Iron uptake and translocation in plants are important processes for both plant and human nutrition, whereas relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of iron transport within the plant body. Several reports have shown that yellow stripe 1 (YS1) and YS1-like (YSL) transporters mediate metal-phytosiderophore uptake and/or metal-nicotianamine translocation. Among the 18 YSL genes in rice (OsYSLs), OsYSL18 is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 679 amino acids containing 13 putative transmembrane domains. An OsYSL18-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that OsYSL18 transports iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not iron(II)-nicotianamine, zinc(II)-deoxymugineic acid, or zinc(II)-nicotianamine. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed more OsYSL18 transcripts in flowers than in shoots or roots. OsYSL18 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that OsYSL18 was expressed in reproductive organs including the pollen tube. In vegetative organs, OsYSL18 was specifically expressed in lamina joints, the inner cortex of crown roots, and phloem parenchyma and companion cells at the basal part of every leaf sheath. These results suggest that OsYSL18 is an iron-phytosiderophore transporter involved in the translocation of iron in reproductive organs and phloem in joints.
19468748	A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance.	2009	Planta	Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) comprise the largest subfamily of transmembrane receptor-like kinases in plants, and they regulate a wide variety of developmental and defense-related processes. In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) strategy was used to specifically knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR-RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance-related gene (designated as OsBRR1) was identified by screening T(0) RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54-04. Wild-type plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. 'Nipponbare') showed intermediate resistance to Ken 54-04, while OsBRR1 suppression plants were susceptible to Ken 54-04. Furthermore, OsBRR1-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to some virulent isolates (97-27-2, 99-31-1 and zhong 10-8-14). OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54-04) and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment. Overexpression or RNAi suppression of OsBRR1 did not cause visible developmental changes in rice plants. These results indicate that OsBRR1 is involved in rice resistance responses to blast fungus and mediates resistance to rice blast.
19466605	The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice.	2009	Mol Cells	We previously isolated the OsCBT gene, which encodes a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein, from a rice expression library constructed from fungal elicitor-treated rice suspension cells. In order to understand the function of OsCBT in rice, we isolated and characterized a T-DNA insertion mutant allele named oscbt-1. The oscbt-1 mutant exhibits reduced levels of OsCBT transcripts and no significant morphological changes compared to wild-type plant although the growth of the mutant is stunted. However, oscbt-1 mutants showed significant resistance to two major rice pathogens. The growth of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, as well as the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was significantly suppressed in oscbt-1 plants. Histochemical analysis indicated that the hypersensitive-response was induced in the oscbt-1 mutant in response to compatible strains of fungal pathogens. OsCBT expression was induced upon challenge with fungal elicitor. We also observed significant increase in the level of pathogenesis-related genes in the oscbt-1 mutant even under pathogen-free condition. Taken together, the results support an idea that OsCBT might act as a negative regulator on plant defense.
19465440	Differential effects of a transgene to confer low phytic acid in caryopses located at different positions in rice panicles.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	In previous studies, we attempted to reduce phytic acid in rice seeds by silencing the 1d-myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase gene, RINO1, using an antisense sequence under the control of the rice glutelin GluB-1 promoter. The stable transgenic line showed a weak low phytic acid phenotype. In this study, we show that the position of the caryopsis in the panicle might affect the level of gene silencing through a difference in temporal and spatial expression patterns between RINO1 and GluB-1 promoters, resulting in a large variation in Pi levels and a small increase in Pi in the transgenic seeds.
19457861	Crystal structure of a class XIB phospholipase A2 (PLA2): rice (oryza sativa) isoform-2 pla2 and an octanoate complex.	2009	J Biol Chem	Phospholipase A(2) catalyzes the specific hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl bond of various glycerophospholipids, producing fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Phospholipase A(2)s (PLA(2)s) constitute a large superfamily of enzymes whose products are important for a multitude of signal transduction processes, lipid mediator release, lipid metabolism, development, plant stress responses, and host defense. The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) isoform 2 phospholipase A(2) has been determined to 2.0 A resolution using sulfur SAD phasing, and shows that the class XIb phospholipases have a unique structure compared with other secreted PLA(2)s. The N-terminal half of the chain contains mainly loop structure, including the conserved Ca(2+)-binding loop, but starts with a short 3(10)-helix and also includes two short anti-parallel beta-strands. The C-terminal half is folded into three anti-parallel alpha-helices, of which the two first are also present in other secreted PLA(2)s and contain the conserved catalytic histidine and calcium liganding aspartate residues. The structure is stabilized by six disulfide bonds. The water structure around the calcium ion binding site suggests the involvement of a second water molecule in the mechanism for hydrolysis, the water-assisted calcium-coordinate oxyanion mechanism. The octanoate molecule in the complex structure is bound in a hydrophobic pocket, which extends to the likely membrane interface and is proposed to model the binding of the product fatty acid. Due to the differences in structure, the suggested surface for binding to the membrane has a different morphology in the rice PLA(2) compared with other phospholipases.
19454733	Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB.	2009	Plant Cell	Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating reproductive development, especially anther development. Our previous studies revealed that the MYB transcriptional factor GAMYB, an important component of GA signaling in cereal aleurone cells, is also important for anther development. Here, we examined the physiological functions of GA during anther development through phenotypic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) GA-deficient, GA-insensitive, and gamyb mutants. The mutants exhibited common defects in programmed cell death (PCD) of tapetal cells and formation of exine and Ubisch bodies. Microarray analysis using anther RNAs of these mutants revealed that rice GAMYB is involved in almost all instances of GA-regulated gene expression in anthers. Among the GA-regulated genes, we focused on two lipid metabolic genes, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase CYP703A3 and beta-ketoacyl reductase, both of which might be involved in providing a substrate for exine and Ubisch body. GAMYB specifically interacted with GAMYB binding motifs in the promoter regions in vitro, and mutation of these motifs in promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transformants caused reduced GUS expression in anthers. Furthermore, a knockout mutant for CYP703A3 showed gamyb-like defects in exine and Ubisch body formation. Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation.
19453459	Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria.	2009	Plant J	RNA editing is the alteration of RNA sequences via insertion, deletion and conversion of nucleotides. In flowering plants, specific cytidine residues of RNA transcribed from organellar genomes are converted into uridines. Approximately 35 editing sites are present in the chloroplasts of higher plants; six pentatricopeptide repeat genes involved in RNA editing have been identified in Arabidopsis. However, although approximately 500 editing sites are found in mitochondrial RNAs of flowering plants, only one gene in Arabidopsis has been reported to be involved in such editing. Here, we identified rice mutants that are defective in seven specific RNA editing sites on five mitochondrial transcripts. Their various phenotypes include delayed seed germination, retarded growth, dwarfism and sterility. Mutant seeds from heterozygous plants are opaque. This mutation, named opaque and growth retardation 1 (ogr1), was generated by T-DNA insertion into a gene that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein containing the DYW motif. The OGR1-sGFP fusion protein is localized to mitochondria. Ectopic expression of OGR1 in the mutant complements the altered phenotypes. We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development.
19453457	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates the OsNAC6 gene that controls seedling root growth in rice.	2009	Plant J	We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, OsHDAC1, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth. To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of OsHDAC1 overexpression (OsHDAC1(OE)), a global profiling of root-expressed genes was performed on OsHDAC1(OE) or HDAC inhibitor-treated non-transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots. We selected 39 genes that are induced and repressed in HDAC inhibitor-treated NT and OsHDAC1(OE) roots, compared with NT roots, respectively. Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression. The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings. These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4.
19453447	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice.	2009	Plant J	Chlorophyll degradation is an important phenomenon in the senescence process. It is necessary for the degradation of certain chlorophyll-protein complexes and thylakoid membranes during leaf senescence. Mutants retaining greenness during leaf senescence are known as 'stay-green' mutants. Non-functional type stay-green mutants, which possess defects in chlorophyll degradation, retain greenness but not leaf functionality during senescence. Here, we report a new stay-green mutant in rice, nyc3. nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant. In addition, a small amount of pheophytin a, a chlorophyll a-derivative without Mg(2+) ions in its tetrapyrrole ring, accumulated in the senescent leaves of nyc3. nyc3 shows a similar but weaker phenotype to stay green (sgr), another non-functional stay-green mutant in rice. The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr. Linkage analysis revealed that NYC3 is located near the centromere region of chromosome 6. Map-based cloning of genes near the centromere is very difficult because of the low recombination rate; however, we overcame this problem by using ionizing radiation-induced mutant alleles harboring deletions of hundreds of kilobases. Thus, it was revealed that NYC3 encodes a plastid-localizing alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein with an esterase/lipase motif. The possible function of NYC3 in the regulation of chlorophyll degradation is discussed.
19453444	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice.	2009	Plant J	Floral organ identity is defined by organ homoetic genes whose coordinated expression is crucial with respect to the time and place of floral organ formation. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development. The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels. Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4. We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression. SL1 encodes a member of the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins, closely related to JAG of Arabidopsis. The functional divergence between SL1 and JAG implies that SL1 was co-opted for its distinctive roles in specification of floral organ identity in rice after the lineage split from Arabidopsis.
19449811	Cross-fertilization for enhancing tocotrienol biosynthesis in rice plants and QTL analysis of their F2 progenies.	2009	J Agric Food Chem	As rice bran tocotrienol (T3) has been known to have a wide range of physiological functions (e.g., antiangiogenesis), we aimed at developing a T3-rich rice variety for nutraceutical purposes. T3 content in more than 250 kinds of rice bran samples were investigated, and Milyang23 was found as the best variety rich in T3. The variety was therefore chosen for cross-fertilization with Koshihikari. Among obtained F(2) progenies, some of them became improved in T3 content (up to 2-fold of reference Koshihikari). QTL analysis of the F(2) progenies revealed five putative loci corresponding to T3 biosynthesis, in which the main loci were located near a marker RM3827 on chromosome 6. The results show that cross-breeding is effective in improving rice bran T3 and provides more genetic understanding on T3 biosynthesis in rice plants.
19448729	G-string slippage turns white rice red.	2009	Genome	The mutations that convey the white pericarp phenotype to rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica) are in a regulatory gene, Rc. We have identified a genetic difference between the cultivar 'Perla' and its natural red rice mutant 'Perla Rosso' in the Rc gene. The deletion of a G base restores the reading frame for the Rc gene, lost by the original 14 bp deletion that gave rise to white rice.
19447378	Mapping QTLs for heading synchrony in a doubled haploid population of rice in two environments.	2009	J Genet Genomics	Simultaneous heading of plants within the same rice variety, also refer to heading synchrony, is an important factor that affects simultaneous ripening of the variety. Understanding of the genetic basis of heading synchrony may contribute to molecular breeding of rice with simultaneous heading and ripening. In the present study, a doubled haploid (DH) population, derived from a cross between Chunjiang 06 and TN1 was used to analyze quantitative trait locus (QTL) for heading synchrony related traits, i.e., early heading date (EHD), late heading date (LHD), heading asynchrony (HAS), and tiller number (PN). A total of 19 QTLs for four traits distributed on nine chromosomes were detected in two environments. One QTL, qHAS-8 for HAS, explained 27.7% of the phenotypic variation, co-located with the QTLs for EHD and LHD, but it was only significant under long-day conditions in Hangzhou, China. The other three QTLs, qHAS-6, qHAS-9, and qHAS-10, were identified under short-day conditions in Hainan, China, each of which explained about 11% of the phenotypic variation. Two of them, qHAS-6 and qHAS-9, were co-located with the QTLs for EHD and LHD. Two QTLs, qPN-4 and qPN-5 for PN, were detected in Hangzhou, and qPN-5 was also detected in Hainan. However, none of them was co-located with QTLs for EHD, LHD, and HAS, suggesting that PN and HAS were controlled by different genetic factors. The results of this study can be useful in marker assisted breeding for improvement of heading synchrony.
19439571	Senescence-induced serotonin biosynthesis and its role in delaying senescence in rice leaves.	2009	Plant Physiol	Serotonin, which is well known as a pineal hormone in mammals, plays a key role in conditions such as mood, eating disorders, and alcoholism. In plants, although serotonin has been suggested to be involved in several physiological roles, including flowering, morphogenesis, and adaptation to environmental changes, its regulation and functional roles are as yet not characterized at the molecular level. In this study, we found that serotonin is greatly accumulated in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves undergoing senescence induced by either nutrient deprivation or detachment, and its synthesis is closely coupled with transcriptional and enzymatic induction of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes as well as tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Transgenic rice plants that overexpressed TDC accumulated higher levels of serotonin than the wild type and showed delayed senescence of rice leaves. However, transgenic rice plants, in which expression of TDC was suppressed through an RNA interference (RNAi) system, produced less serotonin and senesced faster than the wild type, suggesting that serotonin is involved in attenuating leaf senescence. The senescence-retarding activity of serotonin is associated with its high antioxidant activity compared to either tryptophan or chlorogenic acid. Results of TDC overexpression and TDC RNAi plants suggest that TDC plays a rate-limiting role for serotonin accumulation, but the synthesis of serotonin depends on an absolute amount of tryptophan accumulation by the coordinate induction of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes. In addition, immunolocalization analysis revealed that serotonin was abundant in the vascular parenchyma cells, including companion cells and xylem-parenchyma cells, suggestive of its involvement in maintaining the cellular integrity of these cells for facilitating efficient nutrient recycling from senescing leaves to sink tissues during senescence.
19434509	Seed-specific expression of truncated OsGAD2 produces GABA-enriched rice grains that influence a decrease in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.	2009	Transgenic Res	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a four-carbon amino acid that is commonly present in living organisms and functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammals. It is understood to have a potentially anti-hypertensive effect in mammals. GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). In plants, GAD is regulated via its calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD) by Ca(2+)/CaM. We have previously reported that a C-terminal truncated version of one of the five rice GAD isoforms, GAD2DeltaC, revealed higher enzymatic activity in vitro and that its over-expression resulted in exceptionally high GABA accumulation (Akama and Takaiwa, J Exp Bot 58:2699-2607, 2007). In this study, GAD2DeltaC, under the control of the rice glutelin promoter (GluB-1), was introduced into rice cells via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to produce transgenic rice lines. Analysis of the free amino acid content of rice grains revealed up to about a 30-fold higher level of GABA than in non-transformed rice grains. There were also very high levels of various free protein amino acids in the seeds. GABA-enriched rice grains were milled to a fine powder for oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Six weeks of administration showed that transgenic rice brings about a 20 mmHg decrease in blood pressure in two different kinds of SHRs, while there was no significant hypotensive effect in WKYs. These results suggest an alternative way to control and/or cure hypertension in humans with GABA-enriched rice as part of a common daily diet.
19430792	Molecular analyses of the rice glutamate dehydrogenase gene family and their response to nitrogen and phosphorous deprivation.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH, EC 1.4.1.2 approximately 4) are ubiquitous enzymes encoded by GDH genes. So far, at least two GDH members have been characterized in plants, but most members of this family in rice remains to be characterized. Here, we show that four putative GDH genes (OsGDH1-4) are present in the rice genome. The GDH sequences from rice and other species can be classified into two types (I and II). OsGDH1-3 belonged to type II genes, whereas OsGDH4 belonged to type I like gene. Our data implied that the expansion rate of type I genes was much slower than that of type II genes and species-specific expansion contributed to the evolution of type II genes in plants. The expression levels of the different members of GDH family in rice were evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and microarray analysis. Gene expression patterns revealed that OsGDH1, OsGDH2, and OsGDH4 are expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, whereas OsGDH3 expression is glumes and stamens specific. The expression of the OsGDH family members responded differentially to nitrogen and phosphorus-deprivation, indicating their roles under such stress conditions. Implications of the expression patterns with respect to the functions of these genes were discussed.
19429605	Overexpression of the transcription factor AP37 in rice improves grain yield under drought conditions.	2009	Plant Physiol	Transcription factors with an APETELA2 (AP2) domain have been implicated in various cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Of the 139 AP2 genes predicted in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified 42 genes in our current study that are induced by one or more stress conditions, including drought, high salinity, low temperature, and abscisic acid. Phylogenic analysis of these 42 stress-inducible AP2 genes revealed the presence of six subgroups (I-VI) with distinct signature motifs. Two genes, AP37 and AP59, representing subgroups I and II, respectively, were functionally characterized. Both genes were found to be induced upon 2 h of exposure to drought and high-salinity conditions but to differ in their expression profile upon exposure to low temperature and abscisic acid. The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage. Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in OsCc1:AP37 plants. More importantly, the OsCc1:AP37 plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by 16% to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth conditions. In contrast, grain yield in OsCc1:AP59 plants in the field was reduced by 23% to 43% compared with controls under both normal and drought stress conditions. Microarray experiments identified 10 and 38 genes that are up-regulated by AP37 and AP59, respectively, in addition to 37 genes that are commonly induced by both factors. Our results suggest that the AP37 gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes.
19423186	Na(+) but not Cl(-) or osmotic stress is involved in NaCl-induced expression of Glutathione reductase in roots of rice seedlings.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1,6.4.2) is an important reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme. The present study examined the relative importance of Na(+), Cl(-), and the osmotic component in NaCl-induced expression of Oryza sativa glutathione reductase (OsGR) genes in rice roots. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome. The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl. Treatment with 150 mM NaCl and 150 mM NaNO(3) affected OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction similarly, which suggests that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for the NaCl-induced expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3. We also show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for NaCl-enhanced GR activity and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production in rice roots. In addition to its component of ion toxicity, salt concentration in soil results in an osmotic effect. Here, we show that OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression, GR activity, and H(2)O(2) content were not affected at a concentration of mannitol iso-osmotic with 150 mM NaCl. NaCl-induced OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component.
19420799	Study of novel d1 alleles, defective mutants of the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein in rice.	2009	Genes Genet Syst	It has been shown that the disruption of the alpha-subunit gene of heterotorimeric G-proteins (Galpha) results in dwarf traits, the erection of leaves and the setting of small seeds in rice. These mutants are called d1. We have studied the expression profiles of the transcripts and translation products of rice Galpha in ten alleles of d1 including five additional alleles newly identified. By RT-PCR, the transcripts of the Galpha gene were detected in the all d1 alleles. By western blot, the Galpha proteins were not detected in the plasma membrane fractions of the d1 alleles with the exception of d1-4. In d1-4, one amino acid change in the GTP-binding box A of the Galpha protein was occurred and even in this case the Galpha protein was only just detectable in the plasma membrane fraction. Given that the Galpha protein did not accumulate in the plasma membrane fraction in d1-8 which has a deletion of just a single amino acid in the Galpha protein, it is likely that a proper conformation of the Galpha is necessary for accumulation of Galpha protein in the plasma membrane. Nine alleles of d1 showed a severer phenotype whilst d1-4 exhibited a mild phenotype with respect to seed size and elongation pattern of internodes. As brassinosteroid signaling was known to be partially impaired in d1s, the sensitivity to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) was compared among d1 alleles in a T65 genetic background. Only d1-4 showed responses similar to wild type rice. The results show that the d1-4 mutant is a mild allele in terms of the phenotype and mild hyposensitivity to the exogenously applied 24-epiBL.
19417056	The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Ethylene regulates multiple aspects of plant growth and development in dicotyledonous plants; however, its roles in monocotyledonous plants are poorly known. Here, we characterized a subfamily II ethylene receptor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 (ETR2), in rice (Oryza sativa). The ETR2 receptor with a diverged His kinase domain is a Ser/Thr kinase, but not a His kinase, and can phosphorylate its receiver domain. Mutation of the N box of the kinase domain abolished the kinase activity of ETR2. Overexpression of ETR2 in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T-DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering. The effective panicles and seed-setting rate were reduced in the ETR2-overexpressing plants, while thousand-seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the ETR2-RNAi plants and the etr2 mutant compared with controls. Starch granules accumulated in the internodes of the ETR2-overexpressing plants, but not in the etr2 mutant. The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant. Conversely, the alpha-amylase gene RAmy3D was suppressed in ETR2-overexpressing plants but enhanced in the etr2 mutant. Thus, ETR2 may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes.
19415325	OsMSRA4.1 and OsMSRB1.1, two rice plastidial methionine sulfoxide reductases, are involved in abiotic stress responses.	2009	Planta	In proteins, methionine residues are especially sensitive to oxidation, leading to the formation of S- and R-methionine sulfoxide diastereoisomers, and these two methionine sulfoxides can be specifically reversed by two types of methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs), MSRA and MSRB. Previously, we have identified a gene encoding a putative MSR from NaCl-treated roots of Brazilian upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IAPAR 9) via subtractive suppression hybridization (Wu et al. in Plant Sci 168:847-853, 2005). Blast database analysis indicated that at least four MSRA and three MSRB orthologs exist in rice, and two of them, OsMSRA4.1 and OsMSRB1.1, were selected for further functional analysis. Expression analysis showed that both OsMSRA4.1 and OsMSRB1.1 are constitutively expressed in all organs and can be induced by various stress conditions. Subcellular localization and in vitro activity assay revealed that both OsMSR proteins are targeted to the chloroplast and have MSR activity. Overexpression of either OsMSRA4.1 or OsMSRB1.1 in yeast enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, OsMSRA4.1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants also showed enhanced viability under salt treatment. Our results provide genetic evidence of the involvement of OsMSRs in the plant stress responses.
19415284	Unintended consequence of plant transformation: biolistic transformation caused transpositional activation of an endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 in rice ssp. japonica cv. Matsumae.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Genetic instability could be provoked as an unintended consequence of genetic engineering in plants. Here, we report that the rice endogenous long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon Tos17 was transpositionally activated only in transgenic calli and their regenerated plants produced by biolistic transformation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) ssp. japonica cv. Matsumae. Moreover, the transpositional activity of Tos17 was sustained after plant regeneration in the T0 generation, and produced new germinal insertions. In contrast, the element remained totally quiescent in calli and regenerated plants from tissue culture of this genotype. Nonetheless, transcriptional induction and cytosine demethylation of Tos17 were found to have occurred with no significant difference in both kinds of calli, tissue culture alone and transgenic. This suggests that callus culture is likely to have played an important role in destabilizing Tos17 in the direction towards transpositional activation, but that biolistic transformation is the direct causal factor.
19411659	The C-glycosylation of flavonoids in cereals.	2009	J Biol Chem	Flavonoids normally accumulate in plants as O-glycosylated derivatives, but several species, including major cereal crops, predominantly synthesize flavone-C-glycosides, which are stable to hydrolysis and are biologically active both in planta and as dietary components. An enzyme (OsCGT) catalyzing the UDP-glucose-dependent C-glucosylation of 2-hydroxyflavanone precursors of flavonoids has been identified and cloned from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica), with a similar protein characterized in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). OsCGT is a 49-kDa family 1 glycosyltransferase related to known O-glucosyltransferases. The recombinant enzyme C-glucosylated 2-hydroxyflavanones but had negligible O-glucosyltransferase activity with flavonoid acceptors. Enzyme chemistry studies suggested that OsCGT preferentially C-glucosylated the dibenzoylmethane tautomers formed in equilibrium with 2-hydroxyflavanones. The resulting 2-hydroxyflavanone-C-glucosides were unstable and spontaneously dehydrated in vitro to yield a mixture of 6C- and 8C-glucosyl derivatives of the respective flavones. In contrast, in planta, only the respective 6C-glucosides accumulated. Consistent with this selectivity in glycosylation product, a dehydratase activity that preferentially converted 2-hydroxyflavanone-C-glucosides to the corresponding flavone-6C-glucosides was identified in both rice and wheat. Our results demonstrate that cereal crops synthesize C-glucosylated flavones through the concerted action of a CGT and dehydratase acting on activated 2-hydroxyflavanones, as an alternative means of generating flavonoid metabolites.
19410335	Transcriptional activity of rice autonomous transposable element Dart.	2009	J Plant Physiol	The rice Dart/nDart transposon system belongs to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. The nonautonomous element nDart is active in intact rice plants. The autonomous element Dart was identified based on sequence similarity to nDart. Because the rice genome sequence of Nipponbare contains at least 51 Dart elements, it is not clear whether Dart elements are expressed or whether they are transposable. This study characterized for the expression of the predicted ORF of Dart. RNA blotting analysis revealed three transcripts of different lengths. Only the longest transcript (2.5kb) corresponding to the predicted ORF of the Dart element produced a functional TPase. The other transcripts had a frame-shift generating a premature stop codon through alternative splicing. These transcripts were expressed from either of two potentially autonomous Dart elements, Dart01/28 and Dart02. The frequency of alternative splicing differed between the transcripts of the derivative elements. More than 90% of the transcripts from Dart02 were alternatively spliced, compared with only 3% from Dart01/28. The element-specific expression and alternative splicing may control the transposition of nDart.
19410334	Expansin gene expression and anoxic coleoptile elongation in rice cultivars.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Coleoptiles of rice seeds that germinate under anoxia usually elongate to a length far exceeding the elongation that takes place under aerobic conditions. It has been suggested that expansins play a role in this process, but studies examining correlations between transcript levels of expansin genes and anoxic growth of rice coleoptiles are limited. In this study, we used real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis to develop a picture of expansin gene expression (seven alpha- and eight beta-expansins) (EXPA and EXPB) in two rice cultivars showing long (cv. Arborio Precoce) or short (cv. Lamone) coleoptiles when germinated under anoxia. Our qPCR analysis suggested up-regulation occurred for several expansin genes in anoxic coleoptiles in both rice cultivars. However, we found no correlation between transcript levels and the ability to elongate the coleoptile under anoxia.
19409457	Aspartic proteases gene family in rice: Gene structure and expression, predicted protein features and phylogenetic relation.	2009	Gene	Aspartic proteases constitute a large family in eukaryotes, which play fundamental roles in protein processing, maturation and degradation. In this study, we identified 96 OsAP genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the model plant for monocots, by a reiterative database search. The analysis of the complete set of OsAP genes is presented, including chromosomal location, phylogenetic relationships, classification and gene structure. Moreover, a comprehensive expression analysis of OsAP family genes was performed using 24 tissues during the plant life cycle of two rice cultivars. Sixty-six OsAP genes were found to be expressed in at least one of the examined developmental stages, which were divided into 3 classes based on their transcript levels. OsAP genes were also found to be differentially up- or down-regulated in rice seedlings in response to treatments with phytohormones, as well as in plumules/radicles under light/dark conditions. The comprehensive annotation and expression profiling undertaken in this research add to our understanding of OsAP family genes in rice growth and development. Our results also provide a basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation in future studies.
19407986	Identification and characterization of the erect-pose panicle gene EP conferring high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Theor Appl Genet	The breeding of japonica varieties with erect-pose panicle (EP) has recently progressed in the northern part of China, because these varieties exhibit a far higher grain yield than the varieties with normal-pose panicle (NP). A genetic analysis using the F(2) population from the cross between Liaojing5, the first japonica EP variety in China, and the Japanese japonica NP variety Toyonishiki revealed that EP is governed by a single dominant gene EP. Based on previous studies, map-based cloning of EP locus was conducted using Liaojing5, Toyonishiki, their F(2) population, and a pair of near-isogenic lines for EP locus (ZF14 and WF14) derived from the cross between the two varieties; consequently, the STS marker H90 was found to completely cosegregate with panicle pose. The H90 is located in the coding sequence AK101247 in the database, and the AK101247 of Liaojing5 has a 12 bp sequence in exon 5 replaced with a 637 bp sequence of its wild type allele. It was therefore considered that the AK101247 encodes the protein of the wild type allele at EP locus, and that the sequence substitution in exon 5 of Liaojing5 is crucial for expression of the EP phenotype. The effects of EP gene on agronomic traits were investigated using two pairs of near-isogenic lines (ZF6 vs. WF6 and ZF14 vs. WF14) derived from the cross between the two varieties. Experimental results showed that EP gene markedly enhanced grain yield, chiefly by increasing number of secondary branches and number of grains on the secondary branch. EP gene also produced a remarkable increase in grain density.
19407983	Multiple alleles at Early flowering 1 locus making variation in the basic vegetative growth period in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Theor Appl Genet	A recently established rice breeding program in low latitudes aims to develop varieties with extremely long basic vegetative growth (BVG) periods and weak photoperiod sensitivities. The Taiwanese japonica variety Taichung 65 (T65) harbors a recessive allele ef1 at the Ef1 (Early flowering 1) locus, thereby exhibiting an extremely long BVG period. The previous reported functional allele Ehd1 (Early heading date 1), located on chromosome 10, encodes a B-type response regulator, thereby shortening the BVG period, whereas its nonfunctional allele ehd1 greatly prolongs the BVG period. A conventional analysis using F(2) and F(3) populations and a subsequent CAPS analysis based on the amino acid sequences of Ehd1 and ehd1 showed that Ef1 and Ehd1 were at the same locus. The CAPS analysis also indicated that the Taiwanese japonica varieties with extremely long BVG periods all harbor ef1, but that ef1 does not exist among indica and japonica varieties in the low latitudes. Since ef1 has not been found in any japonica varieties outside Taiwan, this allele might have originated in Taiwan. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant allele ef1-h, which prolongs the BVG period even more than ef1 does, harbors an mPing insertion in exon 2, which causes the complete loss of gene function. Our results indicate that both ef1 or ef1-h alleles can be used as new gene sources in developing rice varieties with extremely long BVG periods for low latitudes.
19401410	The effect of sucrose and abscisic acid interaction on sucrose synthase and its relationship to grain filling of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	J Exp Bot	Rice grain filling is a process of conversion of sucrose into starch catalysed by a series of enzymes. Sucrose synthase (SUS) is considered as a key enzyme regulating this process. This study investigated the possible roles of sucrose and abscisic acid (ABA) in mediating the activity and expression of SUS protein of grains during grain filling in rice (Oryza sativa). Field-grown rice plants and detached cultured panicles were used as experimental materials. Several treatments, including spikelet thinning, leaf cutting, and applications of different concentrations of exogenous sucrose and ABA, were imposed during grain filling. A higher SUS activity was found in superior grains than in inferior grains in the earlier stage of grain filling, which was significantly and closely related to a higher grain filling rate and starch accumulation. An increase in sucrose concentration in grains as a result of different treatments increased both SUS activity and SUS protein expression in grains. An increase in ABA concentration gave similar results. Furthermore, effects of interactions between sucrose and ABA on the activity and expression of SUS protein in grains were also found. It was suggested that sucrose- and ABA-mediated rice grain filling is largely due to an increase in SUS activity and SUS protein expression.
19401269	Purification and characterization of rice DNA methyltransferase.	2009	Plant Physiol Biochem	Epigenetic modification is essential for normal development and plays important roles in gene regulation in higher plants. Multiple factors interact to regulate the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in plant genome. We had previously cloned and characterized DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase) gene homologues (OsMET1) from rice. In this present study, determination of DNA MTase activity in different cellular compartments showed that DNA MTase was enriched in nuclei and the activity was remarkably increased during imbibing dry seeds. We had optimized the purification technique for DNA MTase enzyme from shoots of 10-day-old rice seedlings using the three successive chromatographic columns. The Econo-Pac Q, the Hitrap-Heparin and the Superdex-200 columns yielded a protein fraction of a specific activity of 29, 298 and 800 purification folds, compared to the original nuclear extract, respectively. The purified protein preferred hemi-methylated DNA substrate, suggesting the maintenance activity of methylation. The native rice DNA MTase was approximately 160-170 kDa and exhibited a broad pH optimum in the range of 7.6 and 8.0. The enzyme kinetics and inhibitory effects by methyl donor analogs, base analogs, cations, and cationic amines on rice DNA MTase were examined. Global cytosine methylation status of rice genome during development and in various tissue culture systems were monitored and the results suggested that the cytosine methylation level is not directly correlated with the DNA MTase activity. The purification and characterization of rice DNA MTase enzyme are expected to enhance our understanding of this enzyme function and their possible contributions in Gramineae plant development.
19396402	Stage- and tissue-specific expression of rice OsIsu1 gene encoding a scaffold protein for mitochondrial iron-sulfur-cluster biogenesis.	2009	Biotechnol Lett	Isu is a scaffold protein involved in mitochondrial iron-sulfur-cluster biogenesis, which affects redox and iron homeostasis in human and yeast cells. A BLASTP search identified two putative Isu genes in rice, and we designated one of them as OsIsu1. When expressed in onion epidermal cells, OsIsu1::GFP was localized to the mitochondria. Northern analysis showed that OsIsu1 was down-regulated in iron-deficient rice root. OsIsu1 promoter-GUS was introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana and histochemical GUS-staining showed that OsIsu1 expression was regulated in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. OsIsu1 was expressed ectopically in Arabidopsis under the control of the CaMV35S promoter, which increased weight of plants.
19395386	Differentially expressed membrane transporters in rice roots may contribute to cultivar dependent salt tolerance.	2009	J Exp Bot	Salinity tolerance in rice, like in other glycophytes, is a function of cellular ion homeostasis. The large divergence in ion homeostasis between the salt-tolerant FL478 and salt-sensitive IR29 rice varieties can be exploited to understand mechanisms of salinity tolerance. Physiological studies indicate that FL478 shows a lower Na(+) influx, a reduced Na(+) translocation to the shoot, and maintains a lower Na(+):K(+) ratio. To understand the basis of these differences, a comparative investigation of transcript regulation in roots of the two cultivars was undertaken. This analysis revealed that genes encoding aquaporins, a silicon transporter, and N transporters are induced in both cultivars. However, transcripts for cation transport proteins including OsCHX11, OsCNGC1, OsCAX, and OsTPC1 showed differential regulation between the cultivars. The encoded proteins are likely to participate in reducing Na(+) influx, lowering the tissue Na(+):K(+) ratio and limiting the apoplastic bypass flow in roots of FL478 and are therefore important new targets to improve salt tolerance in rice.
19393612	A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based assay for indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase.	2009	Anal Biochem	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amide conjugates play an important role in balancing levels of free IAA in plant cells. The GH3 family of proteins conjugates free IAA with various amino acids. For example, auxin levels modulate expression of the Oryza sativa (rice) GH3-8 protein, which acts to prevent IAA accumulation by coupling the hormone to aspartate. To examine the kinetic properties of the enzyme, we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay system. Bacterially expressed OsGH3-8 was purified to homogeneity and used to establish the assay system. Monitoring of the reaction confirms the reaction product as IAA-Asp and demonstrates that production of the conjugate increases proportionally with both time and enzyme amount. Steady-state kinetic analysis using the LC-MS/MS-based assay yields the following parameters: V/E(t)(IAA)=20.3 min(-1), K(m)(IAA)=123 microM, V/E(t)(ATP)=14.1 min(-1), K(m)(ATP)=50 microM, V/E(t)(Asp)=28.8 min(-1), K(m)(Asp)=1580 microM. This is the first assignment of kinetic values for any IAA-amido synthetase from plants. Compared with previously described LC- and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-based assays, this LC-MS/MS method provides a robust and sensitive means for performing direct kinetic studies on a range of IAA-conjugating enzymes.
19392701	Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis.	2009	Plant J	Meiosis is essential for eukaryotic sexual reproduction and important for genetic diversity among individuals. Although a number of genes regulating homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis have been identified in the plant kingdom, their molecular basis remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice. Two independent alleles, designated pair3-1 and pair3-2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes. Suppression of PAIR3 by RNAi produced similar results to the T-DNA insertion lines. PAIR3 encodes a protein that contains putative coiled-coil motifs, but does not have any close homologs in other organisms. PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis. Our results suggest that PAIR3 plays a crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in meiosis.
19390838	Dissection of the factors affecting development-controlled and race-specific disease resistance conferred by leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-type R genes in rice.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Development-controlled resistance and resistance specificity frequently restrict the application of a disease resistance (R) gene in crop breeding programs. Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21, encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-kinase type plasma membrane proteins, mediate race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases. Plants carrying Xa3/Xa26 and plants carrying Xa21 have different resistance spectra and the functions of the two R genes are regulated by developmental stage. Four chimeric genes encoding proteins consisting of different parts of XA3/XA26 and XA21 were constructed by domain swapping and transformed into a susceptible rice variety. The resistance spectra and development-regulated resistance of the transgenic plants carrying Xa3/Xa26, Xa21, or chimeric gene to different Xoo strains were analyzed in the same genetic background. The results suggest that the gradually increased expression of Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21 plays an important role in the progressively enhanced Xoo resistance during rice development. In addition, the LRR domains of XA3/XA26 and XA21 are important determinants of race-specific recognition during rice-Xoo interaction, but juxtamembrane regions of the two R proteins also appear to contribute to resistance specificity.
19390828	Identification and characterization of alternative promoters of the rice MAP kinase gene OsBWMK1.	2009	Mol Cells	Our previous study suggested that OsBWMK1, a gene which encodes a member of the rice MAP kinase family, generates transcript variants which show distinct expression patterns in response to environmental stresses. The transcript variants are generated by alternative splicing and by use of alternative promoters. To test whether the two alternative promoters, pOsBWMK1L (promoter for the OsBWMK1L splice variant) and pOsBWMK1S (promoter for the OsBWMK1S splice variant), are biologically functional, we analyzed transgenic plants expressing GUS fusion constructs for each promoter. Both pOsBWMK1L and pOsBWMK1S are biologically active, although the activity of pOsBWMK1S is lower than that of pOsBWMK1L. Histochemical analysis revealed that pOsBWMK1L is constitutively active in most tissues at various developmental stages in rice and Arabidopsis, whereas pOsBWMK1S activity is spatially and temporally restricted. Furthermore, the expression of pOsBWMK1S::GUS was upregulated in response to hydrogen peroxide, a plant defense signaling molecule, in both plant species. These results suggest that the differential expression of OsBWMK1 splice variants is the result of alternative promoter usage and, moreover, that the mechanisms controlling OsBWMK1 gene expression are conserved in both monocot and dicot plants.
19390827	Sequence diversity of a domesticated transposase gene, MUG1, in Oryza species.	2009	Mol Cells	MUG1 is a MULE transposon-related domesticated gene in plants. We assessed the sequence diversity, neutrality, expression, and phylogenetics of the MUG1 gene among Oryza ssp. We found MUG1 expression in all tissues analyzed, with different levels in O. sativa. There were 408 variation sites in the 3886 bp of MUG1 locus. The nucleotide diversity of the MUG1 was higher than functionally known genes in rice. The nucleotide diversity (pi) in the domains was lower than the average nucleotide diversity in whole coding region. The pi values in nonsynonymous sites were lower than those of synonymous sites. Tajima D and Fu and Li D* values were mostly negative values, suggesting purifying selection in MUG1 sequences of Oryza ssp. Genome-specific variation and phylogenetic analyses show a general grouping of MUG1 sequences congruent with Oryza ssp. biogeography; however, our MUG1 phylogenetic results, in combination with separate B and D genome studies, might suggest an early divergence of the Oryza ssp. by continental drift of Gondwanaland. O. longistaminata MUG1 divergence from other AA diploids suggests that it might not be a direct ancestor of the African rice species.
19390826	Ectopic expression of a cold-responsive OsAsr1 cDNA gives enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic rice plants.	2009	Mol Cells	The OsAsrt cDNA clone was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from developing seed coats of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Low-temperature stress increased mRNA levels of OsAsr1 in both vegetative and reproductive organs. In situ analysis showed that OsAsr1 transcript was preferentially accumulated in the leaf mesophyll tissues and parenchyma cells of the palea and lemma. For transgenic rice plants that over-expressed full-length OsAsr1 cDNA in the sense orientation, the Fv/Fm values for photosynthetic efficiency were about 2-fold higher than those of wild type-segregating plants after a 24-h cold treatment. Seedlings exposed to prolonged low temperatures were more tolerant of cold stress, as demonstrated during wilting and regrowth tests. Interestingly, OsAsr1 was highly expressed in transgenic rice plants expressing the C-repeat/dehyhdration responsive element binding factor 1 (CBF1), suggesting the regulation of OsAsr1 by CBF1. Taken together, we suggest that OsAsr1 gene play an important role during temperature stress, and that this gene can be used for generating plants with enhanced cold tolerance.
19386809	Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem.	2009	Plant Physiol	Two types of branches, rachis branches (i.e. nonfloral) and spikelets (i.e. floral), are produced during rice (Oryza sativa) inflorescence development. We previously reported that the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets. Here, we identified four dominant mutants producing an increased number of spikelets and found that they are gain-of-function alleles of APO1. The APO1 expression levels are elevated in all four mutants, suggesting that an increase of APO1 activity caused the delay in the program shift to spikelet formation. In agreement with this result, ectopic overexpression of APO1 accentuated the APO1 gain-of-function phenotypes. In the apo1-D dominant alleles, the inflorescence meristem starts to increase in size more vigorously than the wild type when switching to the reproductive development phase. This alteration in growth rate is opposite to what is observed with the apo1 mutants that have a smaller inflorescence meristem. The difference in meristem size is caused by different rates of cell proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that the level of APO1 activity regulates the inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem.
19381642	Ectopic expression of a rice protein phosphatase 2C gene OsBIPP2C2 in tobacco improves disease resistance.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) have been demonstrated to play critical roles in regulation of plant growth/development, abscisic acid signaling pathway and adaptation to environmental stresses. Here we report the cloning and molecular characterization of a novel rice protein phosphatase 2C gene, OsBIPP2C2 (Oryza sativa L. BTH-induced protein phosphatase 2C 2). OsBIPP2C2 has three alternatively spliced transcripts and the largest transcript OsBIPP2C2a encodes a 380 aa protein containing all 11 conserved catalytic subdomains of PP2Cs. Expression of OsBIPP2C2a was significantly induced by benzothiadiazole (BTH), one of defense-related signal molecules in plants. Expression of OsBIP2C2a was induced by infection with the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and the pathogen-induced expression of OsBIPP2C2a in BTH-treated rice seedlings was much earlier and stronger than those in water-treated seedlings. Overexpression of OsBIPP2C2a in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in increased disease resistance against tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. Importantly, the OsBIPP2C2a-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants showed constitutive expression of defense-related genes. These results suggest that OsBIPP2C2a may play an important role in disease resistance through activation of defense response.
19380351	Chlorella starch branching enzyme II (BEII) can complement the function of BEIIb in rice endosperm.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	In monocots, starch branching enzyme II (BEII) was functionally differentiated into BEIIa and BEIIb after separation from the dicots, and in cereals BEIIb plays a distinct role in amylopectin biosynthesis in the endosperm. The present study was conducted to examine to what extent a green algal BEII has an overlapping function with BEIIb in starch biosynthesis by introducing the Chlorella BEII gene into an amylose-extender (ae) mutant of rice. Chlorella BEII was found to complement the contribution of the rice endosperm BEIIb to the structures of amylopectin and starch granules because these mutated phenotypes were recovered almost completely to those of the wild type by the expression of Chlorella BEII. When the recombinant BE enzymes were incubated with the rice ae amylopectin, the branching pattern of Chlorella BEII was much more similar to that of rice BEIIb rather than rice BEIIa. Detailed analyses of BE reaction products suggests that BEIIb and Chlorella BEII only transfer chains with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 6 and 7, whereas BEIIa preferably transfers short chains with a DP of about 6-11. These results show that the Chlorella BEII is functionally similar to rice BEIIb rather than BEIIa.
19376836	Disruption of OsYSL15 leads to iron inefficiency in rice plants.	2009	Plant Physiol	Uptake and translocation of metal nutrients are essential processes for plant growth. Graminaceous species release phytosiderophores that bind to Fe(3+); these complexes are then transported across the plasma membrane. We have characterized OsYSL15, one of the rice (Oryza sativa) YS1-like (YSL) genes that are strongly induced by iron (Fe) deficiency. The OsYSL15 promoter fusion to beta-glucuronidase showed that it was expressed in all root tissues when Fe was limited. In low-Fe leaves, the promoter became active in all tissues except epidermal cells. This activity was also detected in flowers and seeds. The OsYSL15:green fluorescent protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane. OsYSL15 functionally complemented yeast strains defective in Fe uptake on media containing Fe(3+)-deoxymugineic acid and Fe(2+)-nicotianamine. Two insertional osysl15 mutants exhibited chlorotic phenotypes under Fe deficiency and had reduced Fe concentrations in their shoots, roots, and seeds. Nitric oxide treatment reversed this chlorosis under Fe-limiting conditions. Overexpression of OsYSL15 increased the Fe concentration in leaves and seeds from transgenic plants. Altogether, these results demonstrate roles for OsYSL15 in Fe uptake and distribution in rice plants.
19373444	Development of PCR markers to detect the glb1 and Lgc1 mutations for the production of low easy-to-digest protein rice varieties.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Limiting the ingestion of protein is the fundamental idea in the diet therapy for patients with chronic renal failure. Two mutations involved in the content of major rice storage proteins useful for developing low easy-to-digest protein rice variety have been isolated. The glb1 mutation causes the deficiency of alpha-globulin, and the Lgc1 mutation reduces the glutelin content. By combining the glb1 and the Lgc1 mutations, it is possible to reduce the easy-to-digest protein content by approximately 50%. The Lgc1 mutation has been shown to be caused by a 3.5-kb deletion between the glutelin structural genes, GluB4 and GluB5, while the molecular basis of glb1 mutation has been less understood. PCR analysis of the glb1 mutation revealed a 62.8-kb deletion, including the structural gene of alpha-globulin. Based on these lines of information, we generated PCR markers that make it possible to detect the glb1 and Lgc1 mutations. Using those PCR markers, we genotyped F(2) plants segregating for the glb1 mutation and the Lgc1 mutation and confirmed the consistency of genotype and phenotype. Because the PCR marker sets can distinguish heterozygotes, they will be very useful in developing new varieties of low easy-to-digest protein rice.
19372371	A transcriptomic analysis of superhybrid rice LYP9 and its parents.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	By using a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray, designed based on known and predicted indica rice genes, we investigated transcriptome profiles in developing leaves and panicles of superhybrid rice LYP9 and its parental cultivars 93-11 and PA64s. We detected 22,266 expressed genes out of 36,926 total genes set collectively from 7 tissues, including leaves at seedling and tillering stages, flag leaves at booting, heading, flowering, and filling stages, and panicles at filling stage. Clustering results showed that the F1 hybrid's expression profiles resembled those of its parental lines more than that which lies between the 2 parental lines. Out of the total gene set, 7,078 genes are shared by all sampled tissues and 3,926 genes (10.6% of the total gene set) are differentially expressed genes (DG). As we divided DG into those between the parents (DG(PP)) and between the hybrid and its parents (DG(HP)), the comparative results showed that genes in the categories of energy metabolism and transport are enriched in DG(HP) rather than in DG(PP). In addition, we correlated the concurrence of DG and yield-related quantitative trait loci, providing a potential group of heterosis-related genes.
19370321	Mutations of the multi-drug resistance-associated protein ABC transporter gene 5 result in reduction of phytic acid in rice seeds.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) is important to the nutritional quality of cereal and legume seeds. PA and its salts with micronutrient cations, such as iron and zinc, cannot be digested by humans and non-ruminant animals, and hence may affect food/feed nutritional value and cause P pollution of groundwater from animal waste. We previously developed a set of low phytic acid (LPA) rice mutant lines with the aim of increasing the nutritional quality of rice. Two of these lines, Os-lpa-XS110-2 (homozygous non-lethal) Os-lpa-XS110-3 (homozygous lethal), contain two mutant alleles of a LPA gene (hereafter XS-lpa2-1 and XS-lpa2-2, respectively). In this study, we mapped the XS-lpa2-1 gene to a region on chromosome 3 between microsatellite markers RM14360 and RM1332, where the rice orthologue (OsMRP5) of the maize lpa1 gene is located. Sequence analysis of the OsMRP5 gene revealed a single base pair change (C/G-T/A transition) in the sixth exon of XS-lpa2-1 and a 5-bp deletion in the first exon of XS-lpa2-2. OsMRP5 is expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds, and the two mutations do not change the level of RNA transcription. A T-DNA insertion line, 4A-02500, in which OsMRP5 was disrupted, also showed the same high inorganic phosphorus phenotype as Os-lpa-XS110-3 and appeared to be homozygous lethal. PA is significantly reduced in Os-lpa-XS110-2 (~20%) and in 4A-02500 (~90%) seeds compared with their wild type lines, and no PA was detected in Os-lpa-XS110-3 using HPLC analysis. This evidence indicates that the OsMRP5 gene plays an important role in PA metabolism in rice seeds.
19370320	Single feature polymorphisms between two rice cultivars detected using a median polish method.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Expression levels measured in microarrays of oligonucleotide probes have now been adapted as a high throughput approach for identifying DNA sequence variation between genotypes, referred to as single feature polymorphisms (SFPs). Although there have been increasing interests in this approach, there is still need for improving the algorithm in order to achieve high sensitivity and specificity especially with complex genome and large datasets, while maintaining optimal computational performance. We obtained microarray datasets for expression profiles of two rice cultivars and adapted a median polish method to detect SFPs. The analysis identified 6,655 SFPs between two the rice varieties representing 3,131 rice unique genes. We showed that the median polish method has the advantage of avoiding fitting complex linear models thus can be used to analyze complex transcriptome datasets like the ones in this study. The method is also superior in sensitivity, accuracy and computing time requirement compared with two previously used methods. A comparison with data from a resequencing project indicated that 75.6% of the SFPs had SNP supports in the probe regions. Further comparison revealed that SNPs in sequences immediately flanking the probes also had contributions to the detection of SFPs in cases where the probes and the targets had perfectly matched sequences. It was shown that differences in minimum free energies caused by flanking SNPs, which may change the stability of RNA secondary structure, may partly explain the SFPs as detected. These SFPs may facilitate gene discovery in future studies.
19369275	Highly sensitive and high-throughput analysis of plant hormones using MS-probe modification and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: an application for hormone profiling in Oryza sativa.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	We have developed a highly sensitive and high-throughput method for the simultaneous analysis of 43 molecular species of cytokinins, auxins, ABA and gibberellins. This method consists of an automatic liquid handling system for solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (qMS/MS) equipped with an electrospray interface (ESI; UPLC-ESI-qMS/MS). In order to improve the detection limit of negatively charged compounds, such as gibberellins, we chemically derivatized fractions containing auxin, ABA and gibberellins with bromocholine that has a quaternary ammonium functional group. This modification, that we call 'MS-probe', makes these hormone derivatives have a positive ion charge and permits all compounds to be measured in the positive ion mode with UPLC-ESI-qMS/MS in a single run. Consequently, quantification limits of gibberellins increased up to 50-fold. Our current method needs <100 mg (FW) of plant tissues to determine phytohormone profiles and enables us to analyze >180 plant samples simultaneously. Application of this method to plant hormone profiling enabled us to draw organ distribution maps of hormone species in rice and also to identify interactions among the four major hormones in the rice gibberellin signaling mutants, gid1-3, gid2-1 and slr1. Combining the results of hormone profiling data with transcriptome data in the gibberellin signaling mutants allows us to analyze relationships between changes in gene expression and hormone metabolism.
19369274	Phospholipid signaling responses in salt-stressed rice leaves.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Salinity is one of the major environmental factors limiting growth and productivity of rice plants. In this study, the effect of salt stress on phospholipid signaling responses in rice leaves was investigated. Leaf cuts were radiolabeled with 32P-orthophosphate and the lipids extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, autoradiography and phosphoimaging. Phospholipids were identified by co-migration of known standards. Results showed that 32P(i) was rapidly incorporated into the minor lipids, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidic acid (PA) and, interestingly, also into the structural lipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which normally label relatively slowly, like phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Only very small amounts of PIP2 were found. However, in response to salt stress (NaCl), PIP2 levels rapidly (<30 min) increased up to 4-fold, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PA and its phosphorylated product, diacylglycerolpyrophosphate (DGPP), also increased upon NaCl stress, while cardiolipin (CL) levels decreased. All other phospholipid levels remained unchanged. PA signaling can be generated via the combined action of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) or directly via phospholipase D (PLD). The latter can be measured in vivo, using a transphosphatidylation assay. Interestingly, these measurements revealed that salt stress inhibited PLD activity, indicating that the salt stress-induced PA response was not due to PLD activity. Comparison of the 32P-lipid responses in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivars revealed no significant differences. Together these results show that salt stress rapidly activates several lipid responses in rice leaves but that these responses do not explain the difference in salt tolerance between sensitive and tolerant cultivars.
19363683	Genome-wide identification of BURP domain-containing genes in rice reveals a gene family with diverse structures and responses to abiotic stresses.	2009	Planta	Increasing evidence suggests that a gene family encoding proteins containing BURP domains have diverse functions in plants, but systematic characterization of this gene family have not been reported. In this study, 17 BURP family genes (OsBURP01-17) were identified and analyzed in rice (Oryza sativa L.). These genes have diverse exon-intron structures and distinct organization of putative motifs. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of BURP protein sequences from rice and other plant species, the BURP family was classified into seven subfamilies, including two subfamilies (BURP V and BURP VI) with members from rice only and one subfamily (BURP VII) with members from monocotyledons only. Two BURP gene clusters, belonging to BURP V and BURP VI, were located in the duplicated region on chromosome 5 and 6 of rice, respectively. Transcript level analysis of BURP genes of rice in various tissues and organs revealed different tempo-spatial expression patterns, suggesting that these genes may function at different stages of plant growth and development. Interestingly, all the genes of the BURP VII subfamily were predominantly expressed in flower organs. We also investigated the expression patterns of BURP genes of rice under different stress conditions. The results suggested that, except for two genes (OsBURP01 and OsBURP13), all other members were induced by at least one of the stresses including drought, salt, cold, and abscisic acid treatment. Two genes (OsBURP05 and OsBURP16) were responsive to all the stress treatments and most of the OsBURP genes were responsive to salt stress. Promoter sequence analysis revealed an over-abundance of stress-related cis-elements in the stress-responsive genes. The data presented here provide important clues for elucidating the functions of genes of this family.
19363620	The role of root apoplastic transport barriers in salt tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	Planta	Increasing soil salinity reduces crop yields worldwide, with rice being particularly affected. We have examined the correlation between apoplastic barrier formation in roots, Na+ uptake into shoots and plant survival for three rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars of varying salt sensitivity: the salt-tolerant Pokkali, moderately tolerant Jaya and sensitive IR20. Rice plants grown hydroponically or in soil for 1 month were subjected to both severe and moderate salinity stress. Apoplastic barriers in roots were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and their chemical composition determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Na+ content was estimated by flame photometry. Suberization of apoplastic barriers in roots of Pokkali was the most extensive of the three cultivars, while Na+ accumulation in the shoots was the least. Saline stress induced the strengthening of these barriers in both sensitive and tolerant cultivars, with increase in mRNAs encoding suberin biosynthetic enzymes being detectable within 30 min of stress. Enhanced barriers were detected after several days of moderate stress. Overall, more extensive apoplastic barriers in roots correlated with reduced Na+ uptake and enhanced survival when challenged with high salinity.
19357984	Comparative functional analysis of three abiotic stress-inducible promoters in transgenic rice.	2009	Transgenic Res	To identify minimal effective promoters for driving abiotic stress-inducible transgene expression in rice, we selected promoter elements of three stress-responsive genes, viz. rab16A coding for dehydrin, OsABA2 coding for zeaxanthin epoxidase, and a gene coding for a hypothetical protein (HP1) based on the presence of ABA-, salt- and drought-responsive cis-acting elements. These were translationally fused to the gusA reporter gene and introduced into rice to study their effect on heterologous gene expression. The OsABA2 promoter was found to be the most effective and desirable promoter among the three in terms of driving a low constitutive transgene expression under normal conditions and high induction in response to ABA, salt and drought stress, the highest being a 12-fold induction in response to ABA. The rab16A and HP1 promoters resulted in high levels of constitutive expression. While induction of GUS activity was generally two- to threefold for all the treatments in roots for both the promoters, induction in leaves was generally insignificant, the exceptions being rab16A in response to continuous salt stress and HP1 in response to water deficit. It was also observed that the three promoters, in general, resulted in lower constitutive expression, but higher induction in roots as compared to leaves.
19357089	Interaction transcriptome analysis identifies Magnaporthe oryzae BAS1-4 as Biotrophy-associated secreted proteins in rice blast disease.	2009	Plant Cell	Biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae secrete effectors to alter host defenses and cellular processes as they successively invade living rice (Oryza sativa) cells. However, few blast effectors have been identified. Indeed, understanding fungal and rice genes contributing to biotrophic invasion has been difficult because so few plant cells have encountered IH at the earliest infection stages. We developed a robust procedure for isolating infected-rice sheath RNAs in which approximately 20% of the RNA originated from IH in first-invaded cells. We analyzed these IH RNAs relative to control mycelial RNAs using M. oryzae oligoarrays. With a 10-fold differential expression threshold, we identified known effector PWL2 and 58 candidate effectors. Four of these candidates were confirmed to be fungal biotrophy-associated secreted (BAS) proteins. Fluorescently labeled BAS proteins were secreted into rice cells in distinct patterns in compatible, but not in incompatible, interactions. BAS1 and BAS2 proteins preferentially accumulated in biotrophic interfacial complexes along with known avirulence effectors, BAS3 showed additional localization near cell wall crossing points, and BAS4 uniformly outlined growing IH. Analysis of the same infected-tissue RNAs with rice oligoarrays identified putative effector-induced rice susceptibility genes, which are highly enriched for sensor-transduction components rather than typically identified defense response genes.
19353748	Identification and expression analysis of OsHsfs in rice.	2009	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are the central regulators of defense response to heat stress. We identified a total of 25 rice Hsf genes by genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome, including the subspecies of O. japonica and O. indica. Proteins encoded by OsHsfs were divided into three classes according to their structures. Digital Northern analysis showed that OsHsfs were expressed constitutively. The expressions of these OsHsfs in response to heat stress and oxidative stress differed among the members of the gene family. Promoter analysis identified a number of stress-related cis-elements in the promoter regions of these OsHsfs. No significant correlation, however, was found between the heat-shock responses of genes and their cis-elements. Overall, our results provide a foundation for future research of OsHsfs function.
19346465	Two-Step Regulation of LAX PANICLE1 Protein Accumulation in Axillary Meristem Formation in Rice.	2009	Plant Cell	Axillary meristem (AM) formation is an important determinant of plant architecture. In rice (Oryza sativa), LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) function is required for the generation of AM throughout the plant's lifespan. Here, we show a close relationship between AM initiation and leaf development; specifically, the plastochron 4 (P4) stage of leaf development is crucial for the proliferation of meristematic cells. Coincident with this, LAX1 expression starts in the axils of leaves at P4 stage. LAX1 mRNA accumulates in two to three layers of cells in the boundary region between the initiating AM and the shoot apical meristem. In lax1 mutants, the proliferation of meristematic cells is initiated but fails to progress into the formation of AM. The difference in sites of LAX1 mRNA expression and its action suggests non-cell-autonomous characteristics of LAX1 function. We found that LAX1 protein is trafficked to AM in a stage- and direction-specific manner. Furthermore, we present evidence that LAX1 protein movement is required for the full function of LAX1. Thus, we propose that LAX1 protein accumulates transiently in the initiating AM at P4 stage by a strict regulation of mRNA expression and a subsequent control of protein trafficking. This two-step regulation is crucial to the establishment of the new AM.
19339508	A rice mutant sensitive to Al toxicity is defective in the specification of root outer cell layers.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Outer cell layers of rice roots, which comprise epidermis, exodermis and sclerenchyma, have been proposed to protect the roots from various stresses in soil. Here, we report a mutant which is defective in the specification of outer cell layers, and examined the role of these layers in Al and other metal resistance. Morphological and histochemical observations revealed that the mutant isolated based on Al sensitivity frequently showed a disordered pattern of periclinal cell division in the epidermal layers at a region close to the root apical meristem. The lateral root caps in the mutant became difficult to peel off from the epidermis, and epidermal cells became smaller and irregular with far fewer root hairs. Furthermore, some exodermal cells were transformed into additional sclerenchyma cells. However, there was no difference in the inner cell layers between the wild-type rice and the mutant. The mutant showed similar root growth to the wild-type rice in the absence of Al, but greater inhibition of root elongation by Al was found in the mutant. Morin staining showed that Al penetrated into the inner cortical cells in the mutant. Furthermore, the mutant was also sensitive to other metals including Cd and La. Taken together, our results indicate that root outer cell layers protect the roots against the toxicity of Al and other metals by preventing metal penetration into the inner cells. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant phenotypes were controlled by a single recessive gene, which was located on the short arm of rice chromosome 2.
19339499	A homolog of human ski-interacting protein in rice positively regulates cell viability and stress tolerance.	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Abiotic stresses are major limiting factors for growth, development, and productivity of crop plants. Here, we report on OsSKIPa, a rice homolog of human Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) that can complement the lethal defect of the knockout mutant of SKIP homolog in yeast and positively modulate cell viability and stress tolerance of rice. Suppression of OsSKIPa in rice resulted in growth arrest and reduced cell viability. The expression OsSKIPa is induced by various abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsSKIPa exhibited significantly improved growth performance in the medium containing stress agents (abscisic acid, salt, or mannitol) and drought resistance at both the seedling and reproductive stages. The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions. More than 30 OsSKIPa-interacting proteins were identified, but most of these proteins have no matches with the reported SKIP-interacting proteins in animals and yeast. Together, these data suggest that OsSKIPa has evolved a specific function in positive modulation of stress resistance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes in rice.
19337737	Expression of an elicitor-encoding gene from Magnaporthe grisea enhances resistance against blast disease in transgenic rice.	2009	Plant Cell Rep	Elicitors are molecules that stimulate defense responses in plants. Previously, an elicitor-encoding gene, named pemG1, was isolated from Magnaporthe grisea. To assess the function of pemG1 in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare), the gene was cloned under a constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter and introduced into Nipponbare cultivar. The resultant plants showed stable integration and constitutive expression of the pemG1 gene. The expression of defense-related gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was triggered and proline content was also increased in pemG1-expressing plants. The pemG1-expressing plants showed enhanced resistance against rice blast after inoculation with M. grisea spores, suggesting that the pemG1 expression enhances disease resistance in transgenic rice.
19337211	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.	2009	Cell Res	In the monocot rice species Oryza sativa L., one of the most striking morphological processes during reproductive development is the concurrence of panicle development with the sequential elongation of upper internodes (UPIs). To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (NL1), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns. The NL1 gene encodes a GATA-type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild-type plants. Overexpression of NL1 in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that NL1 plays an important role in organ differentiation. A novel mutant allele of PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1), a gene known to play a key role in regulating leaf initiation, was identified in this study. Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1. The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant. Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant. On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.
19327164	Phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization, and expression patterns of RPD3/HDA1 family histone deacetylases in plants.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Although histone deacetylases from model organisms have been previously identified, there is no clear basis for the classification of histone deacetylases under the RPD3/HDA1 superfamily, particularly on plants. Thus, this study aims to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to determine evolutionary relationships between RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases from six different plants representing dicots with Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, and Pinus taeda, monocots with Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and the lower plants with Physcomitrella patens.

RESULTS: Sixty two histone deacetylases of RPD3/HDA1 family from the six plant species were phylogenetically analyzed to determine corresponding orthologues. Three clusters were formed separating Class I, Class II, and Class IV. We have confirmed lower and higher plant orthologues for AtHDA8 and AtHDA14, classifying both genes as Class II histone deacetylases in addition to AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18. Since Class II histone deacetylases in other eukaryotes have been known to undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport, it remains unknown whether such functional regulation also happens in plants. Thus, bioinformatics studies using different programs and databases were conducted to predict their corresponding localization sites, nuclear export signal, nuclear localization signal, as well as expression patterns. We also found new conserved domains in most of the RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases which were similarly conserved in its corresponding orthologues. Assessing gene expression patterns using Genevestigator, it appears that RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylases are expressed all throughout the plant parts and developmental stages of the plant.

CONCLUSION: The RPD3/HDA1 histone deacetylase family in plants is divided into three distinct groups namely, Class I, Class II, and Class IV suggesting functional diversification. Class II comprises not only AtHDA5, AtHDA15, and AtHDA18 but also includes AtHDA8 and AtHDA14. New conserved domains have also been identified in most of the RPD3/HDA1 family indicating further versatile roles other than histone deacetylation.
19326953	International collaborative study of the endogenous reference gene, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of genetically modified rice.	2009	J Agric Food Chem	One rice ( Oryza sativa ) gene, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), has been proven to be a suitable endogenous reference gene for genetically modified (GM) rice detection in a previous study. Herein are the reported results of an international collaborative ring trial for validation of the SPS gene as an endogenous reference gene and its optimized qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems. A total of 12 genetically modified organism (GMO) detection laboratories from seven countries participated in the ring trial and returned their results. The validated results confirmed the species specificity of the method through testing 10 plant genomic DNAs, low heterogeneity, and a stable single-copy number of the rice SPS gene among 7 indica varieties and 5 japonica varieties. The SPS qualitative PCR assay was validated with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1%, which corresponded to about 230 copies of haploid rice genomic DNA, while the limit of quantification (LOQ) for the quantitative PCR system was about 23 copies of haploid rice genomic DNA, with acceptable PCR efficiency and linearity. Furthermore, the bias between the test and true values of eight blind samples ranged from 5.22 to 26.53%. Thus, we believe that the SPS gene is suitable for use as an endogenous reference gene for the identification and quantification of GM rice and its derivates.
19326262	One novel mitochondrial citrate synthase from Oryza sativa L. can enhance aluminum tolerance in transgenic tobacco.	2009	Mol Biotechnol	Rice exhibits the greatest aluminum (Al) tolerance compared with other cereals such as wheat, barley, maize, etc. A full-length gene, OsCS1, encoding citrate synthase, which is highly induced by aluminum toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.), was isolated. Sequence analysis and the sub-cellular localization of OsCS1 in yeast revealed that it is a mitochondrial citrate synthase. OsCS1 was induced by Al toxicity. Several independent transgenic tobacco lines expressing OsCS 1 exhibited increased citrate efflux and extraordinary Al tolerance. Possible outlook for OsCS1 to be applied to enhance plant tolerance to Al toxicity was also discussed.
19324458	Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor from wild rice (OrbHLH2) improves tolerance to salt- and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis.	2009	J Plant Physiol	Salt stress adversely affects plant growth and development. Some plants reduce the damage of high-salt stress by expressing a series of salt-responsive genes. Studies of the molecular mechanism of the salt-stress response have focused on the characterization of components involved in signal perception and transduction. In the present work, we cloned and characterized a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) encoding gene, OrbHLH2, from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which encodes a homologue protein of ICE1 in Arabidopsis. OrbHLH2 protein localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of OrbHLH2 in Arabidopsis conferred increased tolerance to salt and osmotic stress, and the stress-responsive genes DREB1A/CBF3, RD29A, COR15A and KIN1 were upregulated in transgenic plants. Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment showed a similar effect on the seed germination or transcriptional expression of stress-responsive genes in both wild type and OrbHLH2-overexpressed plants, which implies that OrbHLH2 does not depend on ABA in responding to salt stress. OrbHLH2 may function as a transcription factor and positively regulate salt-stress signals independent of ABA in Arabidopsis, which provides some useful data for improving salt tolerance in crops.
19322663	Characterization of Glossy1-homologous genes in rice involved in leaf wax accumulation and drought resistance.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	The outermost surfaces of plants are covered with an epicuticular wax layer that provides a primary waterproof barrier and protection against different environmental stresses. Glossy 1 (GL1) is one of the reported genes controlling wax synthesis. This study analyzed GL1-homologous genes in Oryza sativa and characterized the key members of this family involved in wax synthesis and stress resistance. Sequence analysis revealed 11 homologous genes of GL1 in rice, designated OsGL1-1 to OsGL1-11. OsGL1-1, -2 and -3 are closely related to GL1. OsGL1-4, -5, -6, and -7 are closely related to Arabidopsis CER1 that is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. OsGL1-8, -9, -10 and -11 are closely related to SUR2 encoding a putative sterol desaturase also involved in epicuticular wax biosynthesis. These genes showed variable expression levels in different tissues and organs of rice, and most of them were induced by abiotic stresses. Compared to the wild type, the OsGL1-2-over-expression rice exhibited more wax crystallization and a thicker epicuticular layer; while the mutant of this gene showed less wax crystallization and a thinner cuticular layer. Chlorophyll leaching experiment suggested that the cuticular permeability was decreased and increased in the over-expression lines and the mutant, respectively. Quantification analysis of wax composition by GC-MS revealed a significant reduction of total cuticular wax in the mutant and increase of total cuticular wax in the over-expression plants. Compared to the over-expression and wild type plants, the osgl1-2 mutant was more sensitive to drought stress at reproductive stage, suggesting an important role of this gene in drought resistance.
19318375	Pathogen-induced expressional loss of function is the key factor in race-specific bacterial resistance conferred by a recessive R gene xa13 in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	The fully recessive disease resistance (R) gene xa13, which mediates race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), encodes a plasma membrane protein that differs by one amino acid from that encoded by its dominant (susceptible) allele Xa13. The molecular mechanism of xa13-mediated resistance is largely unknown. Here we show that, compared with its dominant allele, expressional non-reaction of xa13 to Xoo infection, not its protein composition, is the key factor for xa13-mediated resistance. We used the promoter (P(Xa13)) of the dominant Xa13, which was induced by only the incompatible Xoo strain for xa13, to regulate xa13 and xa13(Leu49) (a natural recessive allele of xa13) in the rice line IRBB13 carrying xa13. The transgenic plants showed the same level of susceptibility and bacterial growth rate as those of the rice line carrying dominant Xa13, accompanied by the induced accumulation of xa13 or xa13(Leu49) proteins. Constitutive expression of dominant XA13 or different xa13 proteins (xa13, xa13(Leu49), xa13(Ala85) or xa13(Val184)) in IRBB13 had no effect on Xoo infection in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that race-specific pathogen-induced Xa13 expression is critical for infection. Thus, xa13 stands out from other R genes in that its functions in disease resistance are due to only the loss of pathogen-induced transcriptional motivation caused by natural selection.
19306686	Auxin-regulated OsRGP1 and OsSuS are involved in gravitropic bending of rice shoot bases.	2009	Fen Zi Xi Bao Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Gravitropic bending of horizontally-oriented rice shoots results from the differential elongation of cells in the upper and lower halves of the shoot bases. In this study, genes encoding a reversibly glycosylated polypeptide (OsRGP1) and a sucrose synthase (OsSuS) related to sugar metabolism were identified by suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) as being differentially expressed in gravibending lower and upper halves of rice shoot bases. RT-PCR was used to monitor OsRGP1 and OsSuS gene expression. The two genes were differentially induced in lower and upper halves of the shoot bases during gravitropism and their expression was regulated by auxin. Gene promoter sequence analysis demonstrated the existence of elements related to auxin. Treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor TIBA inhibited the asymmetric expression of OsRGP1 and OsSuS. In addition, an increase in hexose sugars was detected in the lower half of the shoot bases during gravitropism. Our data suggest that asymmetric redistribution of auxin following gravistimulation results in differentially localized OsRGP1 and OsSuS expression. While asymmetric expression of OsSuS may result in a disproportionate distribution of hexose, asymmetric expression of OsRGP1 could induce cell wall polysaccharide synthesis in the lower half of shoot bases. Therefore hexose and cell wall polysaccharide accumulation in the lower half of rice shoot bases might contribute to cell expansion and subsequent gravitropic bending.
19304997	The molecular biology of seasonal flowering-responses in Arabidopsis and the cereals.	2009	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND: In arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) play key roles in regulating seasonal flowering-responses to synchronize flowering with optimal conditions. FT is a promoter of flowering activated by long days and by warm conditions. FLC represses FT to delay flowering until plants experience winter.

SCOPE: The identification of genes controlling flowering in cereals allows comparison of the molecular pathways controlling seasonal flowering-responses in cereals with those of arabidopsis. The role of FT has been conserved between arabidopsis and cereals; FT-like genes trigger flowering in response to short days in rice or long days in temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Many varieties of wheat and barley require vernalization to flower but FLC-like genes have not been identified in cereals. Instead, VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) inhibits long-day induction of FT-like1 (FT1) prior to winter. VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) is activated by low-temperatures during winter to repress VRN2 and to allow the long-day response to occur in spring. In rice (Oryza sativa) a VRN2-like gene Ghd7, which influences grain number, plant height and heading date, represses the FT-like gene Heading date 3a (Hd3a) in long days, suggesting a broader role for VRN2-like genes in regulating day-length responses in cereals. Other genes, including Early heading date (Ehd1), Oryza sativa MADS51 (OsMADS51) and INDETERMINATE1 (OsID1) up-regulate Hd3a in short days. These genes might account for the different day-length response of rice compared with the temperate cereals. No genes homologous to VRN2, Ehd1, Ehd2 or OsMADS51 occur in arabidopsis.

CONCLUSIONS: It seems that different genes regulate FT orthologues to elicit seasonal flowering-responses in arabidopsis and the cereals. This highlights the need for more detailed study into the molecular basis of seasonal flowering-responses in cereal crops or in closely related model plants such as Brachypodium distachyon.
19304938	SHALLOT-LIKE1 is a KANADI transcription factor that modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating leaf abaxial cell development.	2009	Plant Cell	As an important agronomic trait, rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf rolling has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders. Moderate leaf rolling increases the photosynthesis of cultivars and hence raises grain yield. However, the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show the isolation and functional characterization of SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1), a key gene controlling rice leaf rolling. sll1 mutant plants have extremely incurved leaves due to the defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side. Defective development can be functionally rescued by expression of SLL1. SLL1 is transcribed in various tissues and accumulates in the abaxial epidermis throughout leaf development. SLL1 encodes a SHAQKYF class MYB family transcription factor belonging to the KANADI family. SLL1 deficiency leads to defective programmed cell death of abaxial mesophyll cells and suppresses the development of abaxial features. By contrast, enhanced SLL1 expression stimulates phloem development on the abaxial side and suppresses bulliform cell and sclerenchyma development on the adaxial side. Additionally, SLL1 deficiency results in increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis. Our findings identify the role of SLL1 in the modulation of leaf abaxial cell development and in sustaining abaxial characteristics during leaf development. These results should facilitate attempts to use molecular breeding to increase the photosynthetic capacity of rice, as well as other crops, by modulating leaf development and rolling.
19302973	Root and shoot traits responses to phosphorus deficiency and QTL analysis at seedling stage using introgression lines of rice.	2009	J Genet Genomics	Phosphorous (P) deficiency is a major restraint factor for crop production and plants have developed several mechanisms to adapt to low P stress. In this study, a set of 271 introgression lines (ILs) were used to characterize the responses of seedlings to low P availability and to identify QTLs for root traits, biomass, and plant height under P-deficiency and P-sufficiency conditions. Plant height, total dry weight, shoot dry weight, and root number were inhibited under P-deficiency, whereas maximum root length (MRL) and root-shoot ratio (RS) were induced by P-deficiency stress. Relative MRL (RMRL, the ratio of MRL under P-deficiency to MRL under P-sufficiency condition) and relative RS (RRS) were used to evaluate P-deficiency tolerance at the seedling stage. A total of 24 additive QTLs and 29 pairs of epistatic QTLs were detected, but only qRN4 was detected in both conditions. This suggested that different mechanisms may exist in both P supply levels. QTLs for adaptive traits (RMRL, RRS, RRV, and RRDW) and qRN4 consistently expressed to increase trait stability may contribute to P-deficiency tolerance. Twelve intervals were cluster regions of QTLs for P-deficiency tolerance, and one QTL (qRRS8) showed pleiotropic effects on P-deficiency tolerance and drought tolerance. These interesting QTLs can be used in marker-assisted breeding through the target ILs.
19302972	Molecular evolution and functional divergence of HAK potassium transporter gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2009	J Genet Genomics	The high-affinity K(+) (HAK) transporter gene family is the largest family in plant that functions as potassium transporter and is important for various aspects of plant life. In the present study, we identified 27 members of this family in rice genome. The phylogenetic tree divided the land plant HAK transporter proteins into 6 distinct groups. Although the main characteristic of this family was established before the origin of seed plants, they also showed some differences between the members of non-seed and seed plants. The HAK genes in rice were found to have expanded in lineage-specific manner after the split of monocots and dicots, and both segmental duplication events and tandem duplication events contributed to the expansion of this family. Functional divergence analysis for this family provided statistical evidence for shifted evolutionary rate after gene duplication. Further analysis indicated that both point mutant with positive selection and gene conversion events contributed to the evolution of this family in rice.
19293370	Uridine-ribohydrolase is a key regulator in the uridine degradation pathway of Arabidopsis.	2009	Plant Cell	Nucleoside degradation and salvage are important metabolic pathways but hardly understood in plants. Recent work on human pathogenic protozoans like Leishmania and Trypanosoma substantiates an essential function of nucleosidase activity. Plant nucleosidases are related to those from protozoans and connect the pathways of nucleoside degradation and salvage. Here, we describe the cloning of such an enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana, Uridine-Ribohydrolase 1 (URH1) and the characterization by complementation of a yeast mutant. Furthermore, URH1 was synthesized as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. The pure recombinant protein exhibited highest hydrolase activity for uridine, followed by inosine and adenosine, the corresponding K(m) values were 0.8, 1.4, and 0.7 mM, respectively. In addition, URH1 was able to cleave the cytokinin derivative isopentenyladenine-riboside. Promoter beta-glucuronidase fusion studies revealed that URH1 is mainly transcribed in the vascular cells of roots and in root tips, guard cells, and pollen. Mutants expressing the Arabidopsis enzyme or the homolog from rice (Oryza sativa) exhibit resistance toward toxic fluorouridine, fluorouracil, and fluoroorotic acid, providing clear evidence for a pivotal function of URH1 as regulative in pyrimidine degradation. Moreover, mutants with increased and decreased nucleosidase activity are delayed in germination, indicating that this enzyme activity must be well balanced in the early phase of plant development.
19288292	Molecular characterization of rice OsBIANK1, encoding a plasma membrane-anchored ankyrin repeat protein, and its inducible expression in defense responses.	2010	Mol Biol Rep	A rice gene, OsBIANK1, encoding a protein containing a typical ankyrin repeat domain, was cloned and identified. The OsBIANK1 protein, consisting of 329 amino acids, contains a conserved ankyrin repeat domain with two ankyrin repeats organized in tandem and was showed to be localized on cytoplasmic membrane during transient expression in onion epidermal cells. Expression of OsBIANK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical inducer capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIANK1 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. Our preliminary results confirm previous evidences that OsBIANK1 may be involved in regulation of disease resistance response in rice.
19286937	Suppression of a phospholipase D gene, OsPLDbeta1, activates defense responses and increases disease resistance in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol	Phospholipase D (PLD) plays an important role in plants, including responses to abiotic as well as biotic stresses. A survey of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome database indicated the presence of 17 PLD genes in the genome, among which OsPLDalpha1, OsPLDalpha5, and OsPLDbeta1 were highly expressed in most tissues studied. To examine the physiological function of PLD in rice, we made knockdown plants for each PLD isoform by introducing gene-specific RNA interference constructs. One of them, OsPLDbeta1-knockdown plants, showed the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the absence of pathogen infection. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and DNA microarray analyses revealed that the knockdown of OsPLDbeta1 resulted in the up-/down-regulation of more than 1,400 genes, including the induction of defense-related genes such as pathogenesis-related protein genes and WRKY/ERF family transcription factor genes. Hypersensitive response-like cell death and phytoalexin production were also observed at a later phase of growth in the OsPLDbeta1-knockdown plants. These results indicated that the OsPLDbeta1-knockdown plants spontaneously activated the defense responses in the absence of pathogen infection. Furthermore, the OsPLDbeta1-knockdown plants exhibited increased resistance to the infection of major pathogens of rice, Pyricularia grisea and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. These results suggested that OsPLDbeta1 functions as a negative regulator of defense responses and disease resistance in rice.
19285007	OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling.	2009	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Excessive light can be harmful to photosynthetic apparatus since it causes photoinhibition and photooxidation, and plants often encounter hypoxic or anoxic environments when they become submerged by heavy rain or an ensuing flood. In this study, Oryza sativa Differentially Expressed Genes (OsDEGs) from rice under photooxidation and anoxia conditions were isolated using DD-PCR. Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold. However, the transcript levels of two rice OsDEG10 homologs were not changed under those treatments. OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants. Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses.
19279197	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes.	2009	Plant Physiol	MYB transcription factors play central roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. How stress affects development is poorly understood. Here, we show that OsMYB3R-2 functions in both stress and developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa). Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R-2 exhibited enhanced cold tolerance. Cold treatment greatly induced the expression of OsMYB3R-2, which encodes an active transcription factor. We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB3R-2 in rice led to higher transcript levels of several G2/M phase-specific genes, including OsCycB1;1, OsCycB2;1, OsCycB2;2, and OsCDC20.1, than those in OsMYB3R-2 antisense lines or wild-type plants in response to cold treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increased cell mitotic index in overexpressed transgenic lines of OsMYB3R-2 after cold treatment. Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced. The level of cellular free proline was increased in the overexpressed rice lines of OsMYB3R-2 and OsCycB1;1 transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants under the cold treatment. These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress. OsCPT1, which may be involved in the dehydration-responsive element-binding factor 1A pathway, showed the same transcription pattern in response to cold as did OsCycB1;1 in transgenic rice. Therefore, a cold resistance mechanism in rice could be mediated by regulating the cell cycle, which is controlled by key genes including OsMYB3R-2.
19277876	Comprehensive sequence and expression profile analysis of Hsp20 gene family in rice.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	The Hsp20 genes represent the most abundant small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) in plants. Hsp20 gene family has been shown to be involved in preventing heat shock and promoting resistance to environmental stress factors, but very little is known about this gene family in rice. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 39 OsHsp20 genes in rice, describing the gene structure, gene expression, genome localization, and phylogenetic relationship of each member. We have used RT-PCR to perform a characterization of the normal and heat shock-induced expression of selective OsHsp20 genes. A genome-wide microarray based gene expression analysis involving 25 stages of vegetative and reproductive development in three rice cultivars has revealed that 36 OsHsp20 genes were expressed in at least one of the experimental stages studied. Among these, transcripts of OsHsp20 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages and preferentially down-regulated in Shanyou 63. In addition, OsHsp20 genes were identified as showing prominent heterosis in family-level expression. Our results suggest that the expression patterns of the OsHsp20 genes are diversified not only in developmental stages but also in variety level.
19270400	Cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases in wheat: insight into the evolution of rice phytoalexin biosynthetic genes.	2009	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	In vitro assays using recombinant enzymes enabled three cDNAs encoding ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases to be identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum): TaCPS1, TaCPS2, and TaCPS3. The phylogenetic tree and expression analyses suggest that TaCPS3 is responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, while TaCPS1 and TaCPS2 are possible functional homologs of diterpene cyclase genes OsCPS2 and OsCPS4 involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice.
19267902	The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene family in Populus: phylogeny, organization, and expression.	2009	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Lignin is a phenolic heteropolymer in secondary cell walls that plays a major role in the development of plants and their defense against pathogens. The biosynthesis of monolignols, which represent the main component of lignin involves many enzymes. The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis as it catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of monolignols. The CAD gene family has been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and partially in Populus. This is the first comprehensive study on the CAD gene family in woody plants including genome organization, gene structure, phylogeny across land plant lineages, and expression profiling in Populus.

RESULTS: The phylogenetic analyses showed that CAD genes fall into three main classes (clades), one of which is represented by CAD sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms. The other two clades are represented by sequences only from angiosperms. All Populus CAD genes, except PoptrCAD 4 are distributed in Class II and Class III. CAD genes associated with xylem development (PoptrCAD 4 and PoptrCAD 10) belong to Class I and Class II. Most of the CAD genes are physically distributed on duplicated blocks and are still in conserved locations on the homeologous duplicated blocks. Promoter analysis of CAD genes revealed several motifs involved in gene expression modulation under various biological and physiological processes. The CAD genes showed different expression patterns in poplar with only two genes preferentially expressed in xylem tissues during lignin biosynthesis.

CONCLUSION: The phylogeny of CAD genes suggests that the radiation of this gene family may have occurred in the early ancestry of angiosperms. Gene distribution on the chromosomes of Populus showed that both large scale and tandem duplications contributed significantly to the CAD gene family expansion. The duplication of several CAD genes seems to be associated with a genome duplication event that happened in the ancestor of Salicaceae. Phylogenetic analyses associated with expression profiling and results from previous studies suggest that CAD genes involved in wood development belong to Class I and Class II. The other CAD genes from Class II and Class III may function in plant tissues under biotic stresses. The conservation of most duplicated CAD genes, the differential distribution of motifs in their promoter regions, and the divergence of their expression profiles in various tissues of Populus plants indicate that genes in the CAD family have evolved tissue-specialized expression profiles and may have divergent functions.
19266175	Fine mapping SPP1, a QTL controlling the number of spikelets per panicle, to a BAC clone in rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Near isogenic lines (NILs) can be used to efficiently handle a target quantitative trait locus (QTL) by blocking genetic background noise. One QTL, SPP1, which controls the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP), was located on chromosome 1, near Gn1a, a cloned gene for rice production in a recombinant inbred line population. NILs of the SPP1 regions were quickly obtained by self-crossing recombinant inbred line 30 which is heterozygous around SPP1. Using a random NIL-F(2) population of 210 individuals, we mapped SPP1 to a 2.2-cM interval between RM1195 and RM490, which explained 51.1% of SPP variation. The difference in SPP between the two homozygotes was 44. F(2)-1456, one NIL-F(2) plant, was heterozygous in the SPP1 region but was fixed in the region of Gn1a gene. This plant F(3) family showed a very wide variation in SPP, which suggested that it was SPP1 but Gn1a affected the variation of SPP in this population. In a word, SPP1 is a novel gene distinct from Gn1a. Four newly developed InDel markers were used for high-resolution mapping of SPP1 with a large NIL-F(2) population. Finally, it was narrowed down to a bacterial artificial chromosome clone spanning 107 kb; 17 open reading frames have been identified in the region. Of them, LOC_Os01g12160, which encodes an IAA synthetase, is the most interesting candidate gene.
19266169	Characterization of OsIAA1 gene, a member of rice Aux/IAA family involved in auxin and brassinosteroid hormone responses and plant morphogenesis.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Aux/IAA and auxin response factor (ARF) are two important families that have been well recognized for their roles in auxin-mediated responses. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate the auxin responses through interaction with ARF transcription factors. Although quite a few members of the Aux/IAA family have been functionally characterized in dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis, but relatively limited information is available in important crops such as rice. This work focused on isolation and characterization of a member of Aux/IAA family in rice named OsIAA1. The results indicated that OsIAA1 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated. The expression of this gene was induced by various phytohormones including IAA, 2,4-D, kinetin, 24-epibrassinolide, and jasmonic acid. Over-expression of OsIAA1 in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24-epiBL treatment. In addition, the OsIAA1-overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture. Protein interaction analysis suggested that OsIAA1 may act through interaction with OsARF1. T-DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of OsIAA1-overexpression plants. In addition, expression patterns of some genes responsive to brassinosteroid and auxin were changed in the OsIAA1-overexpression plants. These data suggested that OsIAA1 may play important roles in the cross-talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis.
19264754	Inducible antisense suppression of glycolate oxidase reveals its strong regulation over photosynthesis in rice.	2009	J Exp Bot	Photorespiration is one of the most intensively studied topics in plant biology. While a number of mutants deficient in photorespiratory enzymes have been identified and characterized for their physiological functions, efforts on glycolate oxidase (GLO; EC 1.1.3.15) have not been so successful. This is a report about the generation of transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants carrying a GLO antisense gene driven by an estradiol-inducible promoter, which allowed for controllable suppressions of GLO and its detailed functional analyses. The GLO-suppressed plants showed typical photorespiration-deficient phenotypes. More intriguingly, it was found that a positive and linear correlation existed between GLO activities and the net photosynthetic rates (P(N)), and photoinhibition subsequently occurred once P(N) reduction surpassed 60%, indicating GLO can exert a strong regulation over photosynthesis. Various expression analyses identified that Rubisco activase was transcriptionally suppressed in the GLO-suppressed plants, consistent with the decreased Rubisco activation states. While the substrate glycolate accumulated substantially, few changes were observed for the product glyoxylate, and for some other downstream metabolites or genes as well in the transgenic plants. Further analyses revealed that isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, two key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle, were highly up-regulated under GLO deficiency. Taken together, the results suggest that GLO is a typical photorespiratory enzyme and that it can exert a strong regulation over photosynthesis, possibly through a feed-back inhibition on Rubisco activase, and that the glyoxylate cycle may be partially activated to compensate for the photorespiratory glyoxylate when GLO is suppressed in rice.
19263224	Expression profile of calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPKs) genes during the whole lifespan and under phytohormone treatment conditions in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) control plant development and response to various stress environments through the important roles in the regulation of Ca(2+) signaling. Thirty-one CDPK genes have been identified in the rice genome by a complete search of the genome based upon HMM profiles. In this study, the expression of this gene family was analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array in three rice cultivars: Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and their hybrid Shanyou 63 independently. Twenty-seven tissues sampled throughout the entire rice life-span were studied, along with three hormone treatments (GA3, NAA and KT), applied to the seedling at the trefoil stage. All 31 genes were found to be expressed in at least one of the experimental stages studied and revealed diverse expression patterns. We identified differential expression of the OsCPK genes in the stamen (1 day before flowering), the panicle (at the heading stage), the endosperm (days after pollination) and also in callus, in all three cultivars. Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, OsCPK12, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage. The OsCPK genes were also found to be regulated in rice seedlings subjected to different hormone treatment conditions, however their expression were not the same for all varieties. These diverse expression profiles trigger the functional analysis of the CDPK family in rice.
19259642	Over-expression of aspartate aminotransferase genes in rice resulted in altered nitrogen metabolism and increased amino acid content in seeds.	2009	Theor Appl Genet	Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of amino acids. It plays an important role in regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism in almost all organisms. In this study, we over-expressed in rice separately all three AAT genes from rice (OsAAT1~3) and one AAT gene from Escherichia coli (EcAAT). Over-expression was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and constructs were introduced into rice by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Compared with control plants, the transformants showed significantly increased leaf AAT activity and greater seed amino acid and protein contents. No other phenotypic changes were observed. The total leaf AAT activities in plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT were 26.6, 23.6, and 19.6 A min(-1) mg(-1) FW (A: units of activity, defined as increase of absorbency per min per mg; FW: fresh weight), which were significantly higher than that in the wild-type control (17.7 A min(-1) mg(-1) FW). The amino acid content in seeds of transgenic plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT was 119.36, 115.36, and 113.72 mg g(-1), respectively, which were 16.1, 12.0, and 5.4% higher, respectively, than that in the control plants. The transgenic plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT had significantly higher protein contents (increased 22.2, 21.1, and 11.1%, respectively) than wild-type plants. No significant changes were found in leaf AAT activity, seed amino acid content or protein content in OsAAT3 over-expressed plants. The expression patterns of the three OsAAT genes and their different functions are also discussed.
19258439	The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice.	2009	Plant Cell	In rice (Oryza sativa), the shoot-borne crown roots are the major root type and are initiated at lower stem nodes as part of normal plant development. However, the regulatory mechanism of crown root development is poorly understood. In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth. WOX11 was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem. The expression could be induced by exogenous auxin or cytokinin. Loss-of-function mutation or downregulation of the gene reduced the number and the growth rate of crown roots, whereas overexpression of the gene induced precocious crown root growth and dramatically increased the root biomass by producing crown roots at the upper stem nodes and the base of florets. The expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in WOX11 overexpression and RNA interference transgenic plants. Further analysis showed that WOX11 directly repressed RR2, a type-A cytokinin-responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia. The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development.
19252083	The ER chaperone LHS1 is involved in asexual development and rice infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2009	Plant Cell	In planta secretion of fungal pathogen proteins, including effectors destined for the plant cell cytoplasm, is critical for disease progression. However, little is known about the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretion mechanisms used by these pathogens. To determine if normal ER function is crucial for fungal pathogenicity, Magnaporthe oryzae genes encoding proteins homologous to yeast Lhs1p and Kar2p, members of the heat shock protein 70 family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cloned and characterized. Like their yeast counterparts, both LHS1 and KAR2 proteins localized in the ER and functioned in an unfolded protein response (UPR) similar to the yeast UPR. Mutants produced by disruption of LHS1 were viable but showed a defect in the translocation of proteins across the ER membrane and reduced activities of extracellular enzymes. The Deltalhs1 mutant was severely impaired not only in conidiation, but also in both penetration and biotrophic invasion in susceptible rice (Oryza sativa) plants. This mutant also had defects in the induction of the Pi-ta resistance gene-mediated hypersensitive response and in the accumulation of fluorescently-labeled secreted effector proteins in biotrophic interfacial complexes. Our results suggest that proper processing of secreted proteins, including effectors, by chaperones in the ER is requisite for successful disease development and for determining host-pathogen compatibility via the gene-for-gene interaction.
19251430	Characterization of expression of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice.	2009	Plant Physiol Biochem	Starch-debranching enzymes (DBEs) are key enzymes involved in starch metabolism in cereals, having a dual function, in both starch synthesis and degradation. However, their precise roles in this pathway, particularly their expression profiles, remain unclear. In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages. The results showed that this gene was expressed only in seeds. In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region. The promoter was then fused with the GUS reporter gene and its expression was carefully investigated in transgenic rice. The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression. The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages. This observation was very consistent with that of the endogenous transcription analysis by Q-PCR. Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination. The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism.
19250836	Early signalling pathways in rice roots under vanadate stress.	2009	Plant Physiol Biochem	Vanadate is beneficial to plant growth at low concentration. However, plant exposure to high concentrations of vanadate has been shown to arrest cell growth and lead to cell death. We are interested in understanding the signalling pathways of rice roots in response to vanadate stress. In this study, we demonstrated that vanadate induced rice root cell death and suppressed root growth. In addition, we found that vanadate induced ROS accumulation, increased lipid peroxidation and elicited a remarkable increase of MAPKs and CDPKs activities in rice roots. In contrast, pre-treatment of rice roots with ROS scavenger (sodium benzoate), serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor (endothall), and CDPK antagonist (W7), reduced the vanadate-induced MAPKs activation. Furthermore, the expression of a MAPK gene (OsMPK3) and four tyrosine phosphatase genes (OsDSP3, OsDSP5, OsDSP6, and OsDSP10) were regulated by vanadate in rice roots. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that ROS, protein phosphatase, and CDPK may function in the vanadate-triggered MAPK signalling pathway cause cell death and retarded growth in rice roots.
19247688	Deposition of a recombinant peptide in ER-derived protein bodies by retention with cysteine-rich prolamins in transgenic rice seed.	2009	Planta	A 7Crp peptide composed of seven major human T cell epitopes derived from the Japanese cedar pollen allergens Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 is an ideal tolerogen for peptide immunotherapy against Japanese cedar pollinosis. To maximize the accumulation level of the 7Crp peptide in transgenic rice seed, we tested endosperm specific promoters and intracellular localizations suitable for stable accumulation. A 7Crp peptide carrying the KDEL ER retention signal directed by the 2.3-kb promoter of the glutelin GluB-1, which contains a signal peptide, accumulated at the highest level of about 60 microg/grain. Notably, the 7Crp peptide predominantly accumulated in ER-derived protein bodies irrespective of the presence of various sorting signals or expression as a fusion protein with glutelin. We attribute this abnormal pattern of accumulation to the formation of disulfide bonds between the 7Crp peptide and cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) prolamin storage proteins. Furthermore, the formation of these aggregates induced the chaperone proteins BiP and PDI as an ER stress response.
